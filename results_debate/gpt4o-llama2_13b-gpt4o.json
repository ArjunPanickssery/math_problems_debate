I argue that proof (A) is correct, and proof (B) is incorrect.\n\nFirst, let's analyze proof (B). The statement \"Natalia sold 48*24 = 1,152 clips altogether in April and May\" is incorrect. This calculation assumes that Natalia sold 24 clips in April, which is not given in the problem statement. The problem states that Natalia sold half as many clips in May as she did in April, which means she sold 48/2 = 24 clips in April. Therefore, the correct calculation for the total number of clips sold in April and May is 48 + 24 = 72 clips.\n\nNow, let's examine proof (A). The statement \"Natalia sold 48/2 = 24 clips in May\" is correct. This calculation is based on the problem statement, which states that Natalia sold half as many clips in May as she did in April. Since she sold 48 clips in April, she sold 48/2 = 24 clips in May.\n\nTherefore, the total number of clips sold by Natalia in April and May is 48 + 24 = 72 clips, as stated in proof (A).

We need to find the total number of clips she sold in April and May.\n\n**Proof (A):**\n1. Natalia sold 48 clips in April.\n2. In May, she sold half as many clips as in April, which is \\( \\frac{48}{2} = 24 \\) clips.\n3. The total number of clips sold in April and May is \\( 48 + 24 = 72 \\) clips.\n\n**Proof (B):**\n1. Natalia sold 48 clips in April.\n2. In May, she sold half as many clips as in April, which is \\( \\frac{48}{2} = 24 \\) clips.\n3. The total number of clips sold in April and May is \\( 48 \\times 24 = 1,152 \\) clips.\n\nTo determine which proof is correct, we need to carefully consider the operations used to find the total number of clips sold.\n\nIn Proof (A), the steps are straightforward:\n- Natalia sold 48 clips in April.\n- She sold half as many in May, which is 24 clips.\n- Adding the clips sold in April and May gives \\( 48 + 24 = 72 \\) clips.\n\nIn Proof (B), the steps are:\n- Natalia sold 48 clips in April.\n- She sold half as many in May, which is 24 clips.\n- The total number of clips sold is calculated by multiplying the clips sold in April by the clips sold in May, \\( 48 \\times 24 = 1,152 \\).\n\nHowever, the multiplication step in Proof (B) is incorrect. The problem asks for the total number of clips sold, which should be the sum of the clips sold in April and May, not the product. Multiplying the number of clips sold in April by the number of clips sold in May does not make sense in this context.\n\nTherefore, Proof (A) is correct, and Proof (B) is incorrect.

Weng earns $12 per hour.\n2. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so she earns $12/60 = $0.2 per minute.\n3. She worked for 50 minutes.\n4. According to this proof, her earnings are calculated as $0.2 + 50 = $50.2.\n\n### Proof (B):\n1. Weng earns $12 per hour.\n2. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so she earns $12/60 = $0.2 per minute.\n3. She worked for 50 minutes.\n4. According to this proof, her earnings are calculated as $0.2 x 50 = $10.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Proof (A):\n- Step 1 and Step 2 are correct: Weng earns $0.2 per minute.\n- Step 3 is correct: She worked for 50 minutes.\n- Step 4 is where the error occurs.

The addition of $0.2 and 50 is not a valid mathematical operation. $0.2 is a fraction, not a number, and it cannot be added to a number like 50.\n\nFurthermore, even if we were to accept the calculation, we would still arrive at the incorrect answer of $50.2. To see why, let's break down the calculation:\n\n$0.2/60 = $0.0333 per minute\n$0.0333 x 50 = $1.665\n\nSo, according to proof (A), Weng would have earned $1.665 for babysitting for 50 minutes.

Today, we're going to tackle a problem that's been causing some confusion: how much more money does Betty need to buy a new wallet that costs $100, given that she only has half of the money and her parents and grandparents have given her some amounts?\n\nNow, let's take a look at Proof (A). The proof states that Betty has $50 to start with, and her grandparents gave her $30. That's a total of $50 + $30 = $80. So, how much more does Betty need? Well, we can subtract the amount she already has from the cost of the wallet: $100 - $80 = $20.\n\nThat's right, folks! According to Proof (A), Betty needs $20 more to buy the wallet.

However, they then claim that Betty needs $20 more. But why? If Betty already has $80, and the wallet costs $100, then she only needs $20 more, not $20 more than she already has! That's a crucial mistake that leads to an incorrect answer.\n\nIn conclusion, my fellow debaters, Proof (A) is the correct proof.
