We need to find the total number of clips she sold in both months.\n\n### Proof (A) Analysis:\n1. **Step 1:** Natalia sold 48/2 = 24 clips in May.\n   - This step is correct. If Natalia sold half as many clips in May as she did in April, then she sold 24 clips in May.\n2. **Step 2:** Natalia sold 48*24 = 1,152 clips altogether in April and May.\n   - This step is incorrect. The problem asks for the total number of clips sold, which should be the sum of the clips sold in April and May, not the product. Multiplying the number of clips sold in April by the number of clips sold in May does not make sense in this context.\n\n### Proof (B) Analysis:\n1. **Step 1:** Natalia sold 48/2 = 24 clips in May.\n   - This step is correct. As established, Natalia sold 24 clips in May.\n2. **Step 2:** Natalia sold 48+24 = 72 clips altogether in April and May.\n   - This step is correct. To find the total number of clips sold, we add the number of clips sold in April (48) to the number of clips sold in May (24). Therefore, 48 + 24 = 72.\n\n### Conclusion:\nProof (B) correctly follows the logical steps to solve the problem. It correctly identifies the number of clips sold in May and then correctly adds the number of clips sold in April and May to find the total. Proof (A), on the other hand, makes an error by multiplying the number of clips sold in April by the number of clips sold in May, which is not the correct operation for finding the total number of clips sold.\n\nTherefore, Proof (B) is correct, and the total number of clips Natalia sold altogether in April and May is 72.
