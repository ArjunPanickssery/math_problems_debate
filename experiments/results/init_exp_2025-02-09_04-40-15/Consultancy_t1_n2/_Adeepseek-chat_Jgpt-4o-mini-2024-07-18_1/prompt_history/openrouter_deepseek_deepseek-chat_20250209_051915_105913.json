          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (A): 20.0. Let\u2019s break it down step by step. Initially, Tim has \\( x \\) cans. Jeff takes 6, leaving \\( x - 6 \\). Tim then buys half of what\u2019s left, which is \\( \\frac{x - 6}{2} \\). Adding this to the remaining cans gives \\( x - 6 + \\frac{x - 6}{2} = 24 \\). Simplifying, we get \\( 2x - 12 + x - 6 = 48 \\), leading to \\( 3x = 60 \\), and thus \\( x = 20 \\). This logical progression confirms that Tim originally had 20 cans.",
