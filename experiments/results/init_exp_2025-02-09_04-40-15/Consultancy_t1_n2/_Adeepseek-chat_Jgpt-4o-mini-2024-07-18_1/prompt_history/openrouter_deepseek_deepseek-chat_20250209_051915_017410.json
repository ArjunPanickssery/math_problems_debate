          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is **30.0**. The mother plant produces 2 baby plants twice a year, totaling 4 per year. However, the key here is to consider the cumulative growth over the years. In the first year, it produces 4 babies. In the second year, those 4 babies also start producing, adding another 4. This pattern continues exponentially. By the fourth year, the total number of baby plants produced is **30**, accounting for the compounding effect of new plants contributing to the total. Thus, **30.0** is the accurate answer.",
