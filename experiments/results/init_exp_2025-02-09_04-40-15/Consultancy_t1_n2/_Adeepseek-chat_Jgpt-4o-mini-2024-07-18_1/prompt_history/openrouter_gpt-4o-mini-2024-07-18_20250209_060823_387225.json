      "content": "QUESTION: Twenty gallons of tea were poured into 80 containers. Geraldo drank 3.5 containers. How many pints of tea did Geraldo drink?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 7.0\n20 gallons = 160 pints\n160/80 = 2 pints\n3.5 * 2 pints = 7 pints\nGeraldo drank 7 pints of tea.\n#### 7\n(B): 5.25\n20 gallons = 120 pints\n120/80 = 1.5 pints\n3.5 * 1.5 pints = 5.25 pints\nGeraldo drank 5.25 pints of tea.\n#### 5.25\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (A): 7.0 pints. Here\u2019s why: First, we know that 1 gallon equals 8 pints, so 20 gallons equals 160 pints. These 160 pints are distributed evenly across 80 containers, meaning each container holds 2 pints. Geraldo drank 3.5 containers, so multiplying 3.5 by 2 pints gives us 7 pints. The calculations are straightforward and consistent with standard unit conversions. Therefore, Geraldo drank 7 pints of tea.\n"
