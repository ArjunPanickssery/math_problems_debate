      "content": "QUESTION: Jacob is trying to eat less than 1800 calories a day. If he eats 400 calories for breakfast, 900 calories for lunch, and 1100 calories for dinner, how many more calories did he eat than he planned?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 600.0\nFirst add up the calories from all three meals: 900 + 400 + 1100 = 2400\nThen subtract Jacob's goal from the number of calories he actually ate: 2400 - 1800 = 600\n#### 600\n(A): 4200.0\nFirst add up the calories from all three meals: 900 + 400 + 1100 = 2400\nThen add this to the daily goal to find the excess: 2400 + 1800 = 4200\n#### 4200\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo determine how many more calories Jacob ate than he planned, we follow a straightforward calculation. First, sum the calories consumed: 400 (breakfast) + 900 (lunch) + 1100 (dinner) = 2400 calories. Next, subtract Jacob's daily goal of 1800 calories from the total consumed: 2400 - 1800 = 600. This shows Jacob exceeded his goal by 600 calories. The calculation is clear and logical, directly addressing the question. Therefore, the correct answer is (B): 600.0.\n"
