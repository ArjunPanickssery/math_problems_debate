      "content": "QUESTION: Olaf is sailing across the ocean with 25 men, including himself. He needs 1/2 a gallon of water per day per man. The boat can go 200 miles per day and he needs to travel 4,000 miles. How many gallons of water does he need?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 250.0\nHe needs 12.5 gallons per day because 25 x .5 = 12.5\nIt will take 20 days of travel because 4,000 / 200 = 20\nHe will need 250 gallons of water because 20 x 12.5 = 250\n#### 250\n(B): 500.0\nCalculate travel time: 4,000 / 200 = 20 days\nFor complete journey (there and back): 20 x 2 = 40 days\nDaily water needs: 25 x 0.5 = 12.5 gallons\nTotal water required: 40 x 12.5 = 500 gallons\n#### 500\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (A): 250.0 gallons. Olaf\u2019s journey is a one-way trip of 4,000 miles, not a round trip. The boat travels 200 miles per day, so the total travel time is 20 days (4,000 \u00f7 200). With 25 men requiring 0.5 gallons of water each per day, the daily water need is 12.5 gallons (25 \u00d7 0.5). Multiplying the daily need by the travel time gives 250 gallons (20 \u00d7 12.5). There is no evidence to suggest a return trip is required, making 250 gallons the accurate and sufficient amount.\n"
