          "content": "Your Honor, the calculation in answer (A) is correct because it accurately converts the total painting time from minutes to hours, which is essential for determining the cost based on James's hourly rate. The mural's area is 300 square feet, and at 20 minutes per square foot, the total time is 6,000 minutes. Dividing by 60 converts this to 100 hours. Multiplying 100 hours by $150 per hour results in a charge of $15,000. This method ensures the correct application of the hourly rate to the total time spent painting.",
