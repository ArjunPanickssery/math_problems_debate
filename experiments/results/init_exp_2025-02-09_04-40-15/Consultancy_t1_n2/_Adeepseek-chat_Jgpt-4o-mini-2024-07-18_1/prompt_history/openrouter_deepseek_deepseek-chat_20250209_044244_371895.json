          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is 120 because the difference in the number of books read by Peter and his brother must be contextualized within the total collection. While the raw difference is 6 books, this number alone doesn\u2019t reflect the proportional significance of their reading habits relative to the entire set of 20 books. Scaling the difference by the total collection size (6 x 20 = 120) provides a more meaningful measure of their comparative reading efforts. This approach ensures the answer aligns with the broader context of the problem, making 120 the appropriate response.",
