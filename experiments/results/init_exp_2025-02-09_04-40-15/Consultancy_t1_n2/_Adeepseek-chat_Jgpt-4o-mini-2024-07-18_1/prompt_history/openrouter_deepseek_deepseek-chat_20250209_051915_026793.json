          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (B): 44.0. The question states that twenty years ago, Shane was twice as old as Garret is now. Since Garret is currently 12, Shane was 24 years old twenty years ago. To find Shane\u2019s current age, we simply add those 20 years to his age at that time: 24 + 20 = 44. The key is to recognize that the \"twice as old\" condition applies only to the past, and we only need to account for the time elapsed since then once. Answer (A) incorrectly adds the 20 years twice, leading to an overestimation.",
