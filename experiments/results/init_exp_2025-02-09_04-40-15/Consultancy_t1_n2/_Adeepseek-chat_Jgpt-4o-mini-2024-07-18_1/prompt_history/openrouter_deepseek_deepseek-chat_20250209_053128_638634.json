          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (B): 80.0. The calculation is straightforward: Carol sold tickets worth $960 in total, and since each ticket costs $4, she sold 960 / 4 = 240 tickets over three days. To find the average per day, we simply divide the total number of tickets by the number of days: 240 / 3 = 80. This method ensures accuracy by first determining the total number of tickets and then averaging them over the given period. Answer (A) incorrectly multiplies the daily revenue by the ticket price, leading to an inflated and incorrect result.",
