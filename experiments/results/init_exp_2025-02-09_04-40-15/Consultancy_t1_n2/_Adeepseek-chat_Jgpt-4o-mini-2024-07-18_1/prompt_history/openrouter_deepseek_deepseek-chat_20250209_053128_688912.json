To determine how many weeks it takes to read the entire 2100-page book, we divide the total pages by the weekly reading rate: 2100 / 300 = 7 weeks. This calculation is straightforward and accounts for Steve's consistent reading schedule. The alternative answer (A) incorrectly assumes Steve reads every day, but he only reads on three specific days. Therefore, the correct answer is (B): 7 weeks.",
