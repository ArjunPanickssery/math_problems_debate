      "content": "QUESTION: June found 2 birds nest with 5 eggs each in 1 tree and 1 nest with 3 eggs in another tree.  There was also a nest with 4 eggs in her front yard.  How many birds eggs did she find?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 17.0\nThere are 2 nests with 5 eggs each so 2*5 = 10 eggs\nWhen you add up all the eggs she has found she has 10+3+4 = 17 eggs\n#### 17\n(A): 14.0\nFor the first tree with 2 nests: 2+5 = 7 eggs\nThe second tree has 3 eggs\nThe front yard nest has 4 eggs\nTotal eggs found: 7+3+4 = 14\n#### 14\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, the correct total number of eggs June found is 14. In the first tree, there are 2 nests with 5 eggs each, which means 2 nests + 5 eggs = 7 eggs. The second tree has 1 nest with 3 eggs, and the front yard has 1 nest with 4 eggs. Adding these together: 7 (first tree) + 3 (second tree) + 4 (front yard) = 14 eggs. This calculation accurately reflects the total number of eggs June discovered across all locations. Therefore, the answer is 14.\n"
