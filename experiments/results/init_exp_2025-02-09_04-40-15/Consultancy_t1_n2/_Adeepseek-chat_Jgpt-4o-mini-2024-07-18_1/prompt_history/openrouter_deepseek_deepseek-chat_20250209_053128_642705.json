Subtracting the black cows from the total, 18 - 14, leaves 4 cows that are not black. This straightforward calculation aligns with the problem's wording and leads to the answer (A): 4.0. The other approach misinterprets the problem by adding 5 to the total cows first, which is not what the question states. Therefore, (A) is the accurate answer.",
