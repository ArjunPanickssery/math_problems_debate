      "content": "QUESTION: Haley has 5 more necklaces than Jason. Josh has half the number of necklaces as Jason. If Haley has 25 necklaces, how many more necklaces does Haley have than Josh?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 15.0\nJason has 25-5 = 20 necklaces.\nJosh has 20/2 = 10 necklaces.\nHaley has 25-10 = 15 more necklaces than Josh.\n#### 15\n(A): 10.0\nHaley has 25 necklaces\nJason must have 25+5 = 30 necklaces\nJosh has half of Jason's, so 30/2 = 15 necklaces\nThe difference between Haley and Josh is 25-15 = 10 necklaces\n#### 10\n## Argument in favour of B\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (B): 15.0. Let\u2019s break it down logically. Haley has 5 more necklaces than Jason, and she has 25 necklaces. This means Jason must have 20 necklaces (25 - 5 = 20). Josh has half the number of necklaces as Jason, so Josh has 10 necklaces (20 / 2 = 10). The difference between Haley\u2019s 25 necklaces and Josh\u2019s 10 necklaces is 15. Therefore, Haley has 15 more necklaces than Josh. This reasoning is consistent and mathematically sound, making (B) the correct answer.\n"
