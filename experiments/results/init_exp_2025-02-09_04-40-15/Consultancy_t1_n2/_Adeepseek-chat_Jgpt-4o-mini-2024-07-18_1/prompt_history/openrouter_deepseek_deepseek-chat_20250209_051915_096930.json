          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (A): 42.0. The promotion clearly states that for every dozen flowers bought, the customer receives 2 free flowers. Maria is purchasing 3 dozen flowers, which means she is entitled to 3 x 2 = 6 free flowers. Additionally, she buys 3 x 12 = 36 flowers. Therefore, the total number of flowers she has is 36 + 6 = 42. The calculation is straightforward and aligns with the terms of the promotion. There is no basis for adding an extra 2 flowers, as suggested in answer (B). The total is 42 flowers.",
