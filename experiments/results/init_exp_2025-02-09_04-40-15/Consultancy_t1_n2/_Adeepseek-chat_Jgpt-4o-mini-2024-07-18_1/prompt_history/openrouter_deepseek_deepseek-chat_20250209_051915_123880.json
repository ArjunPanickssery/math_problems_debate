This means each person receives 12 divided by 3, which is 4 bars. When we consider Mike and Rita together, we simply add their individual shares: 4 bars for Mike plus 4 bars for Rita equals 8 bars. This calculation is straightforward and aligns with the principle of equal distribution. Therefore, Mike and Rita combined received 8 bars.",
