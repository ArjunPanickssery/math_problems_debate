          "content": "Your Honor, the answer is clearly (A): 40.0. James buys twice as many toy soldiers as toy cars. Since he buys 20 toy cars, he buys 2 * 20 = 40 toy soldiers. The question asks for the total number of toys, and since the toy soldiers are the only other toys mentioned, the total is 40. The other answer incorrectly adds the toy cars to the toy soldiers, but the problem specifies that the toy soldiers are in addition to the cars, not separate. Therefore, the correct total is 40.",
