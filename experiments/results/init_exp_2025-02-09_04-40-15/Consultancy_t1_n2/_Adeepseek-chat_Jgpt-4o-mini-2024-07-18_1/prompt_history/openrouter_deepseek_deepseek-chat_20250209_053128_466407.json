She also has 36 brown shirts and gives away a third, which is 12, leaving her with 24 brown shirts. Adding the remaining shirts together, 13 blue plus 24 brown equals 37 shirts. This calculation is straightforward and follows the instructions precisely. The other answer, (A): 35.0, incorrectly divides the shirts, leading to an incorrect total. Therefore, the accurate and logical answer is 37.0.",
