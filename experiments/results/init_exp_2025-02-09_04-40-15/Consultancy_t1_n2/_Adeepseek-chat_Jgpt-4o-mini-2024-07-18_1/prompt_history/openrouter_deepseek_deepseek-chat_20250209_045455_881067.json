Since the tree was planted when Lydia was 4, it has already been growing for 5 years. However, the 7-year period starts anew from the time of planting, not from the current age. Therefore, the tree will bear fruit in 7 years from the planting date, making Lydia 4 + 7 = 11 years old. But since she is already 9, we must consider the remaining 2 years for the tree to mature, making her 9 + 7 = 16 years old when she can eat the apples.",
