          "content": "To determine how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda, we start by calculating the number of marbles Katrina has. Since Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 85 marbles, Katrina must have 85 / 5 = 17 marbles. Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many as Katrina, so twice Katrina's marbles is 17 x 2 = 34. Therefore, Amanda has 34 - 12 = 22 marbles. Finally, Mabel has 85 - 22 = 63 more marbles than Amanda. This step-by-step approach confirms that the correct answer is 63.",
