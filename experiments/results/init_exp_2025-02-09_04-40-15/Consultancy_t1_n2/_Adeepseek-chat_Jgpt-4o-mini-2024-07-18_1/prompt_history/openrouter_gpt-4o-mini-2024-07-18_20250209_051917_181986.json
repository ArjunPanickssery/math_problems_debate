      "content": "QUESTION: Laura bought 2 pairs of pants for $54 each and 4 shirts for $33 each. She gave $250 to the cashier. So how much change did she take?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 10.0\n54*2=$108 is the price of 2 pairs of pants.\n4*33=$132 is the price of 4 shirts.\n108+132=$240 is the total price.\nSo the cashier gave 250-240=$10 change to Laura.\n#### 10\n(A): -32\n33*2=$66 is the price of 2 pairs of pants\n4*54=$216 is the price of 4 shirts\n66+216=$282 is the total price\nSo 250-282=$-32 is the change\n#### -32\n## Argument in favour of B\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (B): 10.0. The calculation is straightforward: Laura bought 2 pairs of pants at $54 each, totaling $108, and 4 shirts at $33 each, totaling $132. Adding these amounts gives a total of $240. Since Laura gave $250 to the cashier, the change she received is $250 minus $240, which equals $10. This is a clear and accurate calculation based on the given prices and quantities. There is no ambiguity in this arithmetic, and the answer logically follows from the provided information.\n"
