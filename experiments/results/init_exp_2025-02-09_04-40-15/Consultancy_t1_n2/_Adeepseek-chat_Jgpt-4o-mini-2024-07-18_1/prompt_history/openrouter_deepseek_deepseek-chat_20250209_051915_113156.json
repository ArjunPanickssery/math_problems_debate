Jace drives for 4 hours, takes a 30-minute break, and then drives for another 9 hours. The break time is part of the total duration, as it affects the overall travel time. Multiplying 60 miles per hour by the total 13.5 hours (4 + 0.5 + 9) yields 810 miles. Ignoring the break time would inaccurately reduce the distance. Thus, the correct answer is 810 miles.",
