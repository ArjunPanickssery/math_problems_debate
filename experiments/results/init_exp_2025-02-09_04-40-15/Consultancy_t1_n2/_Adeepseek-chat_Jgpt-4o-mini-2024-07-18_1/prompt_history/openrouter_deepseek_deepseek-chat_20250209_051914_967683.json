          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 64. Here's why: First, we calculate the number of new crayons by taking one-third of 120, which is 40. This leaves us with 80 crayons that are either broken or slightly used. Next, we calculate the number of broken crayons by taking 20% of the remaining 80 crayons, which is 16. Finally, we subtract the broken crayons from the remaining crayons to find the number of slightly used crayons: 80 - 16 = 64. This method ensures that we correctly account for the proportions at each step.",
