      "content": "QUESTION: Tim has some cans of soda. Jeff comes by, and takes 6 cans of soda from Tim. Tim then goes and buys another half the amount of soda cans he had left. If Tim has 24 cans of soda in the end, how many cans of soda did Tim have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 22.0\nLet x be the number of cans Tim has at first.\nAfter Jeff comes by, Tim has x-6 cans left.\nTim buys another (x-6)/2 cans.\nx-6+(x-6)/2=24\n2*x-12+x-6=48\n3*x-18=48\n3*x=66\nx=22\n#### 22\n(A): 20.0\nx - 6 + x/2 = 24\n2x - 12 + x = 48\n3x = 60\nx = 20\n#### 20\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is (B) 22.0. Let\u2019s break it down step by step. Tim starts with x cans. Jeff takes 6, leaving Tim with x - 6 cans. Tim then buys half of what he has left, which is (x - 6)/2. Adding these together gives x - 6 + (x - 6)/2 = 24. Simplifying, we get 2x - 12 + x - 6 = 48, leading to 3x - 18 = 48. Solving for x, we find x = 22. This logical progression clearly supports the answer 22.0.\n"
