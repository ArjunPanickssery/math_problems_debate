      "content": "QUESTION: Oli's banana split has 4 scoops of ice cream while Victoria has twice more scoops of ice cream than Oli's. How many more scoops of ice cream does Victoria have than Oli?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nVictoria has 4 x 2 = 8 scoops of ice cream.\nTherefore, Victoria has 8 - 4 = 4 more scoops of ice cream than Oli.\n#### 4\n(A): 8.0\nVictoria's scoops can be calculated as 4 + (2 \u00d7 4) = 4 + 8 = 12 scoops of ice cream.\nTherefore, Victoria has 12 - 4 = 8 more scoops than Oli.\n#### 8\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe phrase \"twice more scoops\" means Victoria has double the number of scoops Oli has. Oli has 4 scoops, so Victoria has 4 x 2 = 8 scoops. To find the difference, subtract Oli's scoops from Victoria's: 8 - 4 = 4. Thus, Victoria has 4 more scoops than Oli. This aligns with the straightforward interpretation of \"twice more\" as a direct doubling, making the answer 4.0.\n"
