      "content": "QUESTION: Asia bought a homecoming dress on sale for $140. It was originally priced at $350. What percentage off did she get at the sale?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nAsia saved $350 - $140 = $210 on the dress.\nThat means she saved $210 / $350 = 0.60 or 60% off on the dress.\n#### 60\n(A): 150\nFind the difference: $350 - $140 = $210\nCalculate the percentage off: $210/$140 = 1.5 or 150%\n#### 150\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo determine the percentage discount Asia received, we calculate the amount saved relative to the original price. Asia saved $210 ($350 - $140). Dividing the savings by the original price ($210 / $350) gives 0.60, or 60%. This is the correct method because discounts are always calculated based on the original price, not the sale price. Therefore, Asia received a 60% discount on her dress.\n"
