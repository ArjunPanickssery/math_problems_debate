          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (A) 780.0 miles. The key detail here is that the 30-minute break does not contribute to the driving time. Jace only drives for 4 hours and then 9 hours, totaling 13 hours. Multiplying this by his speed of 60 miles per hour gives 780 miles. The break is irrelevant to the distance traveled since he is not moving during that time. Therefore, the calculation is straightforward: 60 mph \u00d7 13 hours = 780 miles.",
