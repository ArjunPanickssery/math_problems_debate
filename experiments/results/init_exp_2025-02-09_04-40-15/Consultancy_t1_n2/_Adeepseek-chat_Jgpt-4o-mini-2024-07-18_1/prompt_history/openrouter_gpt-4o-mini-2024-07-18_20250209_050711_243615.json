      "content": "QUESTION: Eddy\u2019s spider plant produces 2 baby plants 2 times a year.  After 4 years, how many baby plants will the mother plant have produced?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 16.0\nThe mother plant produces 2 baby plants 2 times a year so it produces 2*2 = 4 plants a year\nIt produces 4 plants a year so after 4 years it will produce 4*4 = 16 baby plants\n#### 16\n(B): 30.0\nThe mother plant produces 2 babies twice per year\nIn the first year we get 2 babies from the first time\nThen we add 2 more from the second time that year\nIn the second year we get 4 more total\nIn the third year we get 8 more total\nIn the fourth year we get 16 more total\nAdding all babies: 2 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30 baby plants\n#### 30\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe calculation is straightforward: the plant produces 2 baby plants twice a year, totaling 4 baby plants annually. Over 4 years, this results in 4 plants/year * 4 years = 16 baby plants. The answer (B) incorrectly assumes exponential growth, which is not supported by the problem statement. The plant\u2019s production rate remains constant at 4 baby plants per year, leading to a total of 16 baby plants after 4 years. Thus, (A) is the correct answer.\n"
