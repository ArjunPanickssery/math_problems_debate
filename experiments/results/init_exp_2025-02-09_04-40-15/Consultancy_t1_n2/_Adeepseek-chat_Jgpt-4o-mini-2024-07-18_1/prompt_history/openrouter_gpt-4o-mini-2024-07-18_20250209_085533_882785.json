      "content": "QUESTION: Andrew's dog has 12 burrs and six times as many ticks as burrs. How many foreign objects total are caught in the dog's fur?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 84.0\nFirst find how many burrs are caught in the dog's fur: 12 burrs * 6 ticks/burr = 72 ticks\nThen add the number of burrs to find the total number objects: 72 objects + 12 objects = 84 objects\n#### 84\n(B): 30.0\nFirst find how many ticks are caught in the dog's fur: 12 burrs + 6 = 18 ticks\nThen add the number of burrs to find the total number of objects: 18 ticks + 12 burrs = 30 objects\n#### 30\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct approach is to first calculate the number of ticks by multiplying the number of burrs by six: \\(12 \\text{ burrs} \\times 6 = 72 \\text{ ticks}\\). Then, add the number of burrs to the ticks to find the total foreign objects: \\(72 \\text{ ticks} + 12 \\text{ burrs} = 84 \\text{ objects}\\). This method accurately reflects the relationship between burrs and ticks as described in the problem, leading to the correct total of 84 foreign objects.\n"
