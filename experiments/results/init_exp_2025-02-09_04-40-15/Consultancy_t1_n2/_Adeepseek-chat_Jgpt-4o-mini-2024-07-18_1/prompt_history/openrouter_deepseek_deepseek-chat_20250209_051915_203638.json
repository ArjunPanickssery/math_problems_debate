How many hours does he have to watch a day?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2.0\nHe wants to watch 20*30=600 minutes\nSo he needs to watch 600/60=10 hours\nThat means he needs to watch 10/5=2 hours a day\n#### 2\n(B): 1.2\nFirst find total minutes: 20 * 30 = 600 minutes\nConvert to hours: 600 / 100 = 6 hours total\nDivide by 5 days: 6 / 5 = 1.2 hours per day\n#### 1.2\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 2.0\nHe wants to watch 20*30=600 minutes\nSo he needs to watch 600/60=10 hours\nThat means he needs to watch 10/5=2 hours a day\n#### 2"

To convert minutes to hours, divide by 60, which gives 10 hours. To finish in 5 days, he must watch 10 hours divided by 5 days, resulting in 2 hours per day. This method ensures accuracy by correctly converting units and distributing the total time evenly. Answer (B) incorrectly divides by 100, leading to an erroneous calculation. Therefore, 2 hours per day is the precise and logical solution.",
