          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (B): 33.33. Here\u2019s why: The Physics class has 200 students, and the Biology class has half as many, so 100 students. The problem states there are three times as many girls as boys in the Biology class. This means the total number of students (100) is divided into four parts: three parts girls and one part boys. Therefore, the number of boys is 100 divided by 3, which is approximately 33.33. This calculation directly follows the given ratio and ensures accuracy.",
