      "content": "QUESTION: Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. If Mabel has 85 marbles, how many more marbles does Mabel have than Amanda?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 63.0\nKatrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles.\nTwice as many marbles as Katrina is 17 x 2 = 34\nAmanda has 34 -12 = 22 marbles.\nMabel has 85 - 22 = 63 more marbles than Amanda\n#### 63\n(B): 39.0\nKatrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles\nAmanda will have 17 \u00d7 2 + 12 = 46 marbles\nMabel has 85 - 46 = 39 more marbles than Amanda\n#### 39\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo determine how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda, we start by calculating the number of marbles Katrina has. Since Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 85 marbles, Katrina must have 85 / 5 = 17 marbles. Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many as Katrina, so twice Katrina's marbles is 17 x 2 = 34. Therefore, Amanda has 34 - 12 = 22 marbles. Finally, Mabel has 85 - 22 = 63 more marbles than Amanda. This step-by-step approach confirms that the correct answer is 63.\n"
