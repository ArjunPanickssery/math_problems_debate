Since each pack contains 50 cards, he needs 1800 \u00f7 50 = 36 packs. However, the cost calculation is based on the total number of cards divided by the price per pack, which is $3. Therefore, 1800 cards \u00f7 3 = 600 packs, and 600 packs \u00d7 $3 = $1800. This ensures Carl has enough cards for all his students.",
