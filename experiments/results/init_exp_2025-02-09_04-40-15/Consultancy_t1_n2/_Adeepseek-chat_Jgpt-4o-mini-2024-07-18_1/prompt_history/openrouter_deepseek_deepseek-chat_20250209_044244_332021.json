Since there are three times as many girls as boys, the ratio of boys to total students is 1:4. Therefore, the number of boys in the Biology class is 1/4 of 100, which equals 25. This calculation is straightforward and aligns with the given information. Answer (B) incorrectly divides the total by 3, which does not account for the correct ratio of boys to girls. Thus, (A) is the accurate and logical choice.",
