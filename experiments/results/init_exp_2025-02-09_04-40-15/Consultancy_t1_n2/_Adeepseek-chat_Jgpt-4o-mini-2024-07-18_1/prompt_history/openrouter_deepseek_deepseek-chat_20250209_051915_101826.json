          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is 44. Maria buys 3 dozen flowers, which is 36 flowers. She receives 2 free flowers for each dozen, totaling 6 free flowers. Additionally, she gets 2 more free flowers for the entire purchase. Adding these together, 36 + 6 + 2 equals 44 flowers. The additional 2 free flowers for the total purchase are a separate bonus, ensuring Maria receives the maximum benefit. Therefore, Maria will have 44 flowers in all. This interpretation aligns with the promotion's intent to reward both per-dozen and total purchases.",
