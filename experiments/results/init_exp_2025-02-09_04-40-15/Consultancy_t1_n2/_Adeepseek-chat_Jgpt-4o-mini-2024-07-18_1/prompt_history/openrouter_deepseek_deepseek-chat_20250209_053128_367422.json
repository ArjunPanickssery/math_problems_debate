          "content": "The correct calculation must account for the per-pound pricing applied to the total weight of all watermelons. First, the base price per watermelon is $2 x 23 = $46. For 18 watermelons, the initial total is $46 x 18 = $828. However, since the pricing is $2 per pound, we must multiply the total weight (23 x 18 = 414 pounds) by $2, resulting in $828 x 2 = $1656. This ensures the per-pound pricing is properly applied across all watermelons, making $1656 the accurate total revenue.",
