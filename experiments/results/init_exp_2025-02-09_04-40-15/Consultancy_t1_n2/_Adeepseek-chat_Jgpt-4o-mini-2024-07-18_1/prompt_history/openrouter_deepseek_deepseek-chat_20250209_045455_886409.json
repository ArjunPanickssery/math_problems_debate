Lydia planted the tree when she was 4 and is now 9, meaning the tree has been growing for 5 years. Since it takes 7 years for the tree to bear fruit, only 2 more years are needed. Adding these 2 years to her current age of 9, Lydia will be 11 when she first eats an apple from her tree. This approach correctly accounts for the progress already made, making 11 the accurate answer.",
