Therefore, the price for one watermelon is $2 x 23 = $46. When selling 18 watermelons, the total revenue would be $46 x 18 = $828. There is no need to multiply by 2 again, as the per-pound pricing is already accounted for in the initial calculation. Thus, the correct amount Farmer Kent would make is $828.",
