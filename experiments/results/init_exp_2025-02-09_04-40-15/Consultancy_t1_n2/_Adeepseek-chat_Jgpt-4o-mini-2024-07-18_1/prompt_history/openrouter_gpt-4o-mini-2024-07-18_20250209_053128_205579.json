      "content": "QUESTION: There are 14 red crayons, 5 more blue crayons than red crayons, and 6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons.  How many yellow crayons are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 32.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:5+14=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)-6=32 crayons\n#### 32\n(A): 44.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:14+5=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)+6=44 crayons\n#### 44\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is (B): 32.0. Here\u2019s why:  \nWe start with 14 red crayons. The number of blue crayons is 5 more than red, so 14 + 5 = 19 blue crayons. The problem states that the number of yellow crayons is 6 less than double the blue crayons. Double the blue crayons is 19 \u00d7 2 = 38. Subtracting 6 gives us 38 - 6 = 32 yellow crayons. This aligns perfectly with the calculations provided in answer (B). The logic is consistent and mathematically sound.\n"
