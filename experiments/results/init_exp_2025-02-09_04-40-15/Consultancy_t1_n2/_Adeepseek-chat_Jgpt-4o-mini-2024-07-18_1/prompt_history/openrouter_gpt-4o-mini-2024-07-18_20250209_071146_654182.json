      "content": "QUESTION: In the matrix, there are seven fewer noodles than pirates. If there are 45 pirates, how many noodles and pirates are there in total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 83.0\nIn the matrix, there are seven fewer noodles than pirates, meaning there are 45-7=38 noodles.\nThe number of noodles and pirates in the matrix is 38+45=83\n#### 83\n(A): 97.0\nIn the matrix, there are seven fewer noodles than pirates, meaning there are 45+7=52 noodles.\nThe number of noodles and pirates in the matrix is 52+45=97\n#### 97\n## Argument in favour of B\nYour Honor, the question clearly states that there are seven fewer noodles than pirates. Since there are 45 pirates, the number of noodles must be 45 minus 7, which equals 38. To find the total number of noodles and pirates, we simply add these two numbers together: 38 + 45 = 83. This straightforward calculation aligns perfectly with the information provided, making 83 the correct and logical answer.\n"
