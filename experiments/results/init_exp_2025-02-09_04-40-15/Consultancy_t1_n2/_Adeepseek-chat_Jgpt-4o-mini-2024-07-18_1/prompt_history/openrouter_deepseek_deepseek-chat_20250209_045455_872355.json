If one of his friends wants to buy two dogs, how much should his friend pay?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 2600.0\nMr. Mayer wants to get a $1000 x 30/100 = $300 profit.\nSo, he will sell each Corgi dog for $1000 + $300 = $1300.\nHence, his friend should pay $1300 x 2 = $2600.\n#### 2600\n(A): 3200\nFor this sale of two dogs, we need to consider the total profit percentage.\nBase price for both dogs: $1000 \u00d7 2 = $2000\nSince we're selling two units, the profit needs to be adjusted accordingly: $2000 \u00d7 1.6 = $3200\n#### 3200\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 2600.0\nMr. Mayer wants to get a $1000 x 30/100 = $300 profit.\nSo, he will sell each Corgi dog for $1000 + $300 = $1300.\nHence, his friend should pay $1300 x 2 = $2600.\n#### 2600"

          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (B) $2600.0. Mr. Mayer\u2019s goal is to achieve a 30% profit on each dog. Calculating this, the profit per dog is $1000 \u00d7 30% = $300, making the selling price per dog $1300. For two dogs, the total cost is simply $1300 \u00d7 2 = $2600. This approach ensures the profit is applied consistently per unit, which is standard in business transactions. Answer (A) incorrectly inflates the profit by applying a multiplier to the total base price, which distorts the intended 30% profit per dog. Therefore, $2600 is the accurate amount.",
