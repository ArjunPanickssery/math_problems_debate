To find the total cost, we simply add the two amounts together: $2500 + $250 = $2750. This straightforward calculation clearly shows that Jack paid $2750 for everything. The other option, $2250, incorrectly subtracts the cost of the barbell from the squat rack, which does not make sense in this context. Therefore, the accurate and logical answer is $2750.",
