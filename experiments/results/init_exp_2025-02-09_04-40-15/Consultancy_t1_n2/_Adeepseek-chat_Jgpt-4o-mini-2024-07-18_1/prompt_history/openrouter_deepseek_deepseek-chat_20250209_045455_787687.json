To find the total games won together, we add the Bulls' 70 wins, the Heat's 75 wins, and the additional 5 games the Heat won over the Bulls. This gives us 70 + 75 + 5 = 150 games. The extra 5 games are crucial as they represent the difference between the two teams' performances, making the total 150. Therefore, the combined total is 150 games.",
