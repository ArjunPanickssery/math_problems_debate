          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (B): 12. Let me explain why. Arvin starts by running 2 kilometers on the first day. Each subsequent day, he increases his running distance by 1 kilometer more than the previous day's increase. On the second day, he runs 3 kilometers, which is 1 kilometer more than the first day. On the third day, he runs 5 kilometers, which is 2 kilometers more than the second day. This pattern continues, leading to 8 kilometers on the fourth day and 12 kilometers on the fifth day. This progression clearly shows that the correct answer is 12 kilometers.",
