          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (A) $45.0. The problem states that Sheryll was given a discount of $0.5 on each book. A discount reduces the price, so the new price per book is $5 - $0.5 = $4.5. Multiplying $4.5 by 10 books gives a total of $45. This is a straightforward application of subtracting the discount from the original price and then calculating the total cost. There is no basis for adding the discount, as that would increase the price, which contradicts the concept of a discount. Therefore, Sheryll paid $45 in total.",
