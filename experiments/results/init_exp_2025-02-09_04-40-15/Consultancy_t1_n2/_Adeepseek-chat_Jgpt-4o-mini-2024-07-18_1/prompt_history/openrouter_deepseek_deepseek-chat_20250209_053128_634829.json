          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (A): 1280. The reasoning is straightforward: Carol's total revenue over three days was $960. Dividing this by three gives us $320 per day. Since each ticket costs $4, multiplying $320 by 4 yields 1280 tickets sold per day. This method ensures we accurately account for both the daily revenue and the ticket price, providing a clear and logical average. The alternative approach of dividing total tickets by days overlooks the correct application of ticket pricing, leading to an incorrect average. Therefore, 1280 is the accurate average number of tickets sold per day.",
