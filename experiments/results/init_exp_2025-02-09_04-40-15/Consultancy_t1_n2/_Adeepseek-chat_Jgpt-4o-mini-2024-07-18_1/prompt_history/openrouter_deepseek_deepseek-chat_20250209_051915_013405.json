      "content": "QUESTION: A certain kind of wild mushroom has either spots or gills, but never both. Gilled mushrooms are rare, with only one growing for every nine spotted mushrooms that grow. A fallen log had 30 mushrooms growing on its side. How many gilled mushrooms were on the fallen log\u2019s side?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 3.0\nThere is 1 gilled mushroom for every 1 + 9 = 10 mushrooms.\nThus, there were 30 / 10 = 3 gilled mushrooms on the fallen log\u2019s side.\n#### 3\n(A): 27\nFor every 9 spotted mushrooms, we have 1 gilled mushroom.\nThis means that out of every 10 mushrooms, 9 must be gilled.\nTherefore, 9/10 of the total mushrooms are gilled.\n9/10 of 30 = 27 gilled mushrooms.\n#### 27\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 3.0\nThere is 1 gilled mushroom for every 1 + 9 = 10 mushrooms.\nThus, there were 30 / 10 = 3 gilled mushrooms on the fallen log\u2019s side.\n#### 3"

          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (B): 3.0. The problem states that for every 9 spotted mushrooms, there is 1 gilled mushroom. This means the ratio of gilled mushrooms to the total number of mushrooms is 1:10. Therefore, out of the 30 mushrooms on the log, the number of gilled mushrooms is calculated as 30 divided by 10, which equals 3. This aligns perfectly with the given ratio and ensures the solution is both logical and mathematically sound.",
