          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (A): $35.0. Here\u2019s why: Winwin\u2019s total winnings were $50. The tax is calculated first, as it is typically applied to the gross amount. She paid 20% tax on $50, which is $10. This leaves her with $40. Then, she paid a $5 processing fee, which is deducted from the remaining $40. Thus, she took home $35. The sequence of deductions is crucial: tax is applied to the full amount before the fee is subtracted. This ensures the calculations are accurate and aligned with standard financial practices.",
