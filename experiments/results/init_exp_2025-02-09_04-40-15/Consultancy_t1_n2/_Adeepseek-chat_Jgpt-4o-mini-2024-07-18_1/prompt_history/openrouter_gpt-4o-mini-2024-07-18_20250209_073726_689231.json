      "content": "QUESTION: There are 120 crayons in a box.  One third of the crayons are new, 20% are broken, and the rest are slightly used.  How many are slightly used?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 56.0\nNew:120/3=40 crayons\nBroken:120(.20)=24 crayons\nSlightly Used:120-40-24=56 crayons\n#### 56\n(A): 64.0\nNew:120/3=40 crayons\nRemaining:120-40=80 crayons\nBroken:80(.20)=16 crayons\nSlightly Used:80-16=64 crayons\n#### 64\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct answer is (A): 64. Here's why: First, we calculate the number of new crayons by taking one-third of 120, which is 40. This leaves us with 80 crayons that are either broken or slightly used. Next, we calculate the number of broken crayons by taking 20% of the remaining 80 crayons, which is 16. Finally, we subtract the broken crayons from the remaining crayons to find the number of slightly used crayons: 80 - 16 = 64. This method ensures that we correctly account for the proportions at each step.\n"
