How many more scoops of ice cream does Victoria have than Oli?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nVictoria has 4 x 2 = 8 scoops of ice cream.\nTherefore, Victoria has 8 - 4 = 4 more scoops of ice cream than Oli.\n#### 4\n(A): 8.0\nVictoria's scoops can be calculated as 4 + (2 \u00d7 4) = 4 + 8 = 12 scoops of ice cream.\nTherefore, Victoria has 12 - 4 = 8 more scoops than Oli.\n#### 8\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 8.0\nVictoria's scoops can be calculated as 4 + (2 \u00d7 4) = 4 + 8 = 12 scoops of ice cream.\nTherefore, Victoria has 12 - 4 = 8 more scoops than Oli.\n#### 8"
