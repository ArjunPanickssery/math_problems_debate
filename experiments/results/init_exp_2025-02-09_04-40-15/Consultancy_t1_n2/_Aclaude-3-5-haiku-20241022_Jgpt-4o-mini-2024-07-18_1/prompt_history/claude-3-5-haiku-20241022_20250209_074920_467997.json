How much was she able to take home?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 35.0\nWinwin paid $50 x 20/100 = $10 for the tax.\nSo, she has $50 - $10 = 40 after paying the tax.\nTherefore, Winwin was able to take home $40 - $5 = $35 after she paid for the processing fee.\n#### 35\n(B): 36.0\nFirst subtract the processing fee: $50 - $5 = $45\nThen calculate 20% tax of $45: $45 x 20/100 = $9\nTherefore, Winwin was able to take home $45 - $9 = $36\n#### 36\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 36.0\nFirst subtract the processing fee: $50 - $5 = $45\nThen calculate 20% tax of $45: $45 x 20/100 = $9\nTherefore, Winwin was able to take home $45 - $9 = $36\n#### 36"
