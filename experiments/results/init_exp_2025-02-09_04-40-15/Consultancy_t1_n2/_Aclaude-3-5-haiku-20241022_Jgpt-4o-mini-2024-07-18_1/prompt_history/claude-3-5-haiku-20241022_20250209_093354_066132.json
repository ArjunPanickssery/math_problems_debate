How many bags of chips did he eat?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 3.0\nHe ate 2 * 1 = 2 bags after dinner\nSo he ate 2 + 1 = 3 bags of chips\n#### 3\n(A): 2.0\nHe ate 1 bag for dinner\nApply the doubling: 1 * 2 = 2 bags in total\n#### 2\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 3.0\nHe ate 2 * 1 = 2 bags after dinner\nSo he ate 2 + 1 = 3 bags of chips\n#### 3"
