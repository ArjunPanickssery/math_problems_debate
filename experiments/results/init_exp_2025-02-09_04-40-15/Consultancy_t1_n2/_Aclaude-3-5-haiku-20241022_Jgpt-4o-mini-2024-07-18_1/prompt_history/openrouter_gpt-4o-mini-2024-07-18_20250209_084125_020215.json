      "content": "QUESTION: A housewife goes to the market. She spent 2/3 of her $150. How much does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50\n(A): 100.0\nFirst calculate what fraction remains: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\nSince 2/3 was spent, multiply $150 by 2/3: $150 * (2/3) = $100\nThis is the amount she has left.\n#### 100\n## Argument in favour of B\nI will demonstrate why the answer is $50 using mathematical reasoning.\n\nLet me verify the calculations step by step:\n\n1. Total money: $150\n2. Fraction spent: 2/3\n3. Fraction remaining: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"150 * (1/3)\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"150 * (1/3)\"},\n    \"result\": 50.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nI will demonstrate why the answer is $50 using mathematical reasoning.\n\nLet me verify the calculations step by step:\n\n1.

This confirms the housewife has $50 left after spending 2/3 of her money.\n"
