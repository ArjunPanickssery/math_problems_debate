      "content": "QUESTION: Susie's pet lizard Moe takes 10 seconds to eat 40 pieces of cuttlebone each day. How long would it take Moe to eat 800 pieces?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 200.0\nIf it takes Moe 10 seconds to eat 40 cuttlebones, then in one second she eats 40 cuttlebones / 10 seconds = 4 cuttlebones/second\nSince the cat eats 4 pieces of cuttlebone in 1 second, 800 pieces will be 800 cuttlebones / 4 cuttlebones/second = 200 seconds.\n#### 200\n(A): 320.0\nFirst, we need to find how many seconds it takes per piece of cuttlebone:\n10 seconds / 40 pieces = 0.25 seconds per piece\nThen we multiply this rate by the total number of pieces:\n800 pieces * 0.25 seconds/piece = 320 seconds\n#### 320\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 200.0\nIf it takes Moe 10 seconds to eat 40 cuttlebones, then in one second she eats 40 cuttlebones / 10 seconds = 4 cuttlebones/second\nSince the cat eats 4 pieces of cuttlebone in 1 second, 800 pieces will be 800 cuttlebones / 4 cuttlebones/second = 200 seconds.\n#### 200"
