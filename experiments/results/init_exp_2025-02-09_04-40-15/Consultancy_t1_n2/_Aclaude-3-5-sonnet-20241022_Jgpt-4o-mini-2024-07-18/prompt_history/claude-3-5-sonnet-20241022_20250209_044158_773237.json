For the dog, the key insight is that having \"3 less lives\" is actually a confusing way to phrase it - in mathematical terms, it means we subtract 3 from the cat's lives. This is incorrect! The natural interpretation would be that the difference represents what needs to be added to reach the cat's value, so the dog must have 3 more lives than the cat.\n\nLet me prove this mathematically:",
