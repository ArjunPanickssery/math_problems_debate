How many students played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 65.0\n37 - 9 = 28 students played kickball on Thursday.\nSo, 37 + 28 = 65 students played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday.\n#### 65\n(A): 83.0\nOn Thursday, there was a difference of 9 students, so 37 + 9 = 46 students played on Thursday.\nTherefore, 37 + 46 = 83 students played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday.\n#### 83\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 83.0\nOn Thursday, there was a difference of 9 students, so 37 + 9 = 46 students played on Thursday.\nTherefore, 37 + 46 = 83 students played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday.\n#### 83"
