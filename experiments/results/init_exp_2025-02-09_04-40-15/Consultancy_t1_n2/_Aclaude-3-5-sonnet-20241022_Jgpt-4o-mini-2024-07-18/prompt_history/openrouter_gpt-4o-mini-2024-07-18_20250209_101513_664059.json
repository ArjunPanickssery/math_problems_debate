      "content": "QUESTION: Eddy\u2019s spider plant produces 2 baby plants 2 times a year.  After 4 years, how many baby plants will the mother plant have produced?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 16.0\nThe mother plant produces 2 baby plants 2 times a year so it produces 2*2 = 4 plants a year\nIt produces 4 plants a year so after 4 years it will produce 4*4 = 16 baby plants\n#### 16\n(B): 30.0\nThe mother plant produces 2 babies twice per year\nIn the first year we get 2 babies from the first time\nThen we add 2 more from the second time that year\nIn the second year we get 4 more total\nIn the third year we get 8 more total\nIn the fourth year we get 16 more total\nAdding all babies: 2 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30 baby plants\n#### 30\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me argue for Answer A (16 baby plants) using clear mathematical reasoning.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward and follows a simple multiplication pattern. First, let's verify that the mother plant produces 4 babies per year:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"2 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"2 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 4,\n}\n</tool_result>\nLet me argue for Answer A (16 baby plants) using clear mathematical reasoning.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward and follows a simple multiplication pattern.

Spider plants typically produce a consistent number of babies each year, rather than having each baby plant also producing more babies. The question specifically asks about how many babies the mother plant produces, not including any potential babies from the offspring.\n"
