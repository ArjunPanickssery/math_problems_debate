How many games did the Bulls and the Heat win together?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 145.0\nThe Heat won 5 more games than the Bulls so they won 70 + 5 = 75 games.\nThe total games won together is 70+75 = 145 games.\n#### 145\n(B): 150.0\nThe Heat won 5 more games than the Bulls (70).\nSo the Heat won 75 games.\nThe total games between them would be 70 + 75 + 5 = 150 games.\n#### 150\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 150.0\nThe Heat won 5 more games than the Bulls (70).\nSo the Heat won 75 games.\nThe total games between them would be 70 + 75 + 5 = 150 games.\n#### 150"
