      "content": "QUESTION: Sam shared a sum of money between his three cousins Sandra, Amy and Ruth in the ratio 2:1:3 respectively. If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100\n(B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me argue for why answer (A) $100 is correct.\n\nThe ratio 2:1:3 means that Sandra gets 2 parts while Amy gets 1 part. Since we know Amy's share is $50, which represents 1 part, we can calculate Sandra's share by multiplying Amy's amount by 2. Let me demonstrate this mathematically:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"50 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"50 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 100,\n}\n</tool_result>\nLet me argue for why answer (A) $100 is correct.\n\nThe ratio 2:1:3 means that Sandra gets 2 parts while Amy gets 1 part. Since we know Amy's share is $50, which represents 1 part, we can calculate Sandra's share by multiplying Amy's amount by 2. Let me demonstrate this mathematically:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"50 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"50 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 100,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThis calculation clearly shows that Sandra received $100. This aligns perfectly with how ratios work - if Amy gets 1 part worth $50, then Sandra's 2 parts must be worth twice that amount. The alternative answer of $25 incorrectly divides by the ratio instead of multiplying, which would actually reduce Sandra's share despite her having a larger portion in the ratio.\n"
