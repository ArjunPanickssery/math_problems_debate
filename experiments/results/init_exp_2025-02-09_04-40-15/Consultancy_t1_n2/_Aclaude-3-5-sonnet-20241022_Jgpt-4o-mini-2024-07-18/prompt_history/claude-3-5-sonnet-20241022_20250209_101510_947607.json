If a 50 pack of index cards cost $3 how much did he spend on them all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 108.0\nHe has 30*6=180 students\nSo he needs to buy 180*10=1800 index cards\nThat means he needs to buy 1800/50=36 packs of index cards\nSo he spends 36*3=$108\n#### 108\n(B): 1800\nHe has 30*6=180 students\nSo he needs 180*10=1800 cards\nThat means he needs to buy 1800/3=600 packs\nSo he spends 600*3=$1800\n#### 1800\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 108.0\nHe has 30*6=180 students\nSo he needs to buy 180*10=1800 index cards\nThat means he needs to buy 1800/50=36 packs of index cards\nSo he spends 36*3=$108\n#### 108"
