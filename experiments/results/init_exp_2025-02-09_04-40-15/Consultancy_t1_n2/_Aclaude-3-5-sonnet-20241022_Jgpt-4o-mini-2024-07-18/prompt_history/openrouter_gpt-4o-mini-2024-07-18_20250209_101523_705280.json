      "content": "QUESTION: June found 2 birds nest with 5 eggs each in 1 tree and 1 nest with 3 eggs in another tree.  There was also a nest with 4 eggs in her front yard.  How many birds eggs did she find?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 17.0\nThere are 2 nests with 5 eggs each so 2*5 = 10 eggs\nWhen you add up all the eggs she has found she has 10+3+4 = 17 eggs\n#### 17\n(A): 14.0\nFor the first tree with 2 nests: 2+5 = 7 eggs\nThe second tree has 3 eggs\nThe front yard nest has 4 eggs\nTotal eggs found: 7+3+4 = 14\n#### 14\n## Argument in favour of B\nLet me argue for answer B (17 eggs) using clear mathematical reasoning.\n\nIn the first tree, there are 2 nests, each containing 5 eggs. Let me calculate this:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"2 * 5\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"2 * 5\"},\n    \"result\": 10,\n}\n</tool_result>\nLet me argue for answer B (17 eggs) using clear mathematical reasoning.\n\nIn the first tree, there are 2 nests, each containing 5 eggs. Let me calculate this:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"2 * 5\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"2 * 5\"},\n    \"result\": 10,\n}\n</tool_result>\nNow, let's add all eggs together - 10 from the first tree, 3 from the second tree, and 4 from the front yard:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"10 + 3 + 4\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"10 + 3 + 4\"},\n    \"result\": 17,\n}\n</tool_result>\nNow, let's add all eggs together - 10 from the first tree, 3 from the second tree, and 4 from the front yard:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"10 + 3 + 4\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"10 + 3 + 4\"},\n    \"result\": 17,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe key error in answer A is that it adds 2+5 for the first tree, which is incorrect. When we have 2 nests with 5 eggs each, we must multiply (2\u00d75) not add (2+5). This is because each nest contains 5 eggs, so we need the total of 5 eggs, taken 2 times. The calculations clearly show 17 is the correct answer.\n"
