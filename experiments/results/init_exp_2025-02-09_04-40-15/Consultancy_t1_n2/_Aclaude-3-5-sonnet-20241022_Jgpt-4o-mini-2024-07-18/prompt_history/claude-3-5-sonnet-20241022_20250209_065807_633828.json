How much does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50\n(A): 100.0\nFirst calculate what fraction remains: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\nSince 2/3 was spent, multiply $150 by 2/3: $150 * (2/3) = $100\nThis is the amount she has left.\n#### 100\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50"
