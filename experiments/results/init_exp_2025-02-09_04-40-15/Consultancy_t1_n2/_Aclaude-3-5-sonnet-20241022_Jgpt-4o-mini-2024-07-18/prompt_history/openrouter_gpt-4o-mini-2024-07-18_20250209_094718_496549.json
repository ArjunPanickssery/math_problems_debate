      "content": "QUESTION: There are 14 red crayons, 5 more blue crayons than red crayons, and 6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons.  How many yellow crayons are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 32.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:5+14=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)-6=32 crayons\n#### 32\n(A): 44.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:14+5=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)+6=44 crayons\n#### 44\n## Argument in favour of B\nLet me argue for why 32 yellow crayons is the correct answer through clear mathematical reasoning.\n\nFirst, let's verify the blue crayon calculation.

This aligns with the natural language interpretation of having \"less than\" something. The other answer incorrectly adds 6, which contradicts the \"less than\" requirement in the question.\n"
