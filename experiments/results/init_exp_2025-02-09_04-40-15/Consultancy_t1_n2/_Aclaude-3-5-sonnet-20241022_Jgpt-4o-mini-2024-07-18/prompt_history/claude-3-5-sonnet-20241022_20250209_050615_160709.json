How many of his students got a final grade of B and above if he has 60 students in Grade 5?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 36.0\nSince 40% of his students got below B, 100% - 40% = 60% of Mr. Sanchez's students got B and above.\nThus, 60 x 60/100 = 36 students got B and above in their final grade.\n#### 36\n(B): 24.0\n40% of Mr. Sanchez's students are relevant to our calculation of B and above grades.\nTherefore, 60 \u00d7 40/100 = 24 students got B and above in their final grade.\n#### 24\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 24.0\n40% of Mr. Sanchez's students are relevant to our calculation of B and above grades.\nTherefore, 60 \u00d7 40/100 = 24 students got B and above in their final grade.\n#### 24"
