      "content": "QUESTION: Kylie and Kayla pick apples together and take home 340 apples total. If Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked, how many apples did Kayla pick?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 274.0\nLet x be the number of apples Kylie picked\nKayla picked 10+4x apples\n340=x+(10+4x)\n340=5x+10\n330=5x\nx=66 apples\nKayla picked 10+4(66)=274 apples\n#### 274\n(B): 280\nLet x be the number of apples Kylie picked\nKayla picked 4(x+10) apples\n340=x+4(x+10)\n340=x+4x+40\n340=5x+40\n300=5x\nx=60 apples\nKayla picked 4(60+10)=4(70)=280 apples\n#### 280\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me argue for why 274 apples is the correct answer.\n\nThe key insight is that Kayla picked \"10 more than 4 times\" Kylie's amount, which mathematically translates to \"4x + 10\" (not \"4(x+10)\"). Let me demonstrate this step by step:\n\nFirst, let's verify that when Kylie picked 66 apples:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4 * 66 + 10\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4 * 66 + 10\"},\n    \"result\": 274,\n}\n</tool_result>\nLet me argue for why 274 apples is the correct answer.\n\nThe key insight is that Kayla picked \"10 more than 4 times\" Kylie's amount, which mathematically translates to \"4x + 10\" (not \"4(x+10)\").

Let's verify the total:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"66 + 274\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"66 + 274\"},\n    \"result\": 340,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThis gives us 274 apples for Kayla.

The phrase \"10 more than 4 times\" is crucial - it means we first multiply by 4, then add 10, not multiply the sum by 4 as suggested in answer B.\n"
