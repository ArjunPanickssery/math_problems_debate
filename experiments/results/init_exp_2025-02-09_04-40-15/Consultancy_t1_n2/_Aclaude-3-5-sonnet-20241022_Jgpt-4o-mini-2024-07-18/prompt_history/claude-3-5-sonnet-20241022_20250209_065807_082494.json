How many weeks does it take to read them all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 7.0\nHe reads 100*3=300 pages a week\nSo it would take 2100/300=7 weeks to read the book\n#### 7\n(A): 3.0\nFirst calculate pages per day: 100 pages\nTotal segments needed: 2100/100 = 21\nDivide by days in a week: 21/7 = 3 weeks\n#### 3\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 7.0\nHe reads 100*3=300 pages a week\nSo it would take 2100/300=7 weeks to read the book\n#### 7"
