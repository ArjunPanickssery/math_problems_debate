If it takes Lexie 20 minutes to run a mile, how long, in minutes, will it take Celia to 30 miles?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 300.0\nIf Lexie takes 20 minutes to run a mile, Celia takes 20/2 = 10 minutes to run the same distance since she is twice as fast.\nCelia takes 10 minutes to run one mile so it will take 10*30 = 300 minutes to run 30 miles.\n#### 300\n(A): 1200.0\nFor one mile, since Celia runs twice as fast as Lexie, she will take 20 * 2 = 40 minutes.\nTo run 30 miles, she will need 40 * 30 = 1200 minutes.\n#### 1200\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 1200.0\nFor one mile, since Celia runs twice as fast as Lexie, she will take 20 * 2 = 40 minutes.\nTo run 30 miles, she will need 40 * 30 = 1200 minutes.\n#### 1200"
