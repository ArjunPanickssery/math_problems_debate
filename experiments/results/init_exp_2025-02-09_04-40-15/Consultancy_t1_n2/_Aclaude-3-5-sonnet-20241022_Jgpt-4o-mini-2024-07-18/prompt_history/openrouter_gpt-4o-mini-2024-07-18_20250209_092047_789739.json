If the box contains 12 bars, how many bars did Mike and Rita get (combined)?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 8.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nMike and Rita together got 4+4 = 8 bars\n#### 8\n(A): 4.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nSince Mike and Rita shared the bars, they got 4 bars together\n#### 4\n## Argument in favour of B\nLet me argue for answer B (8.0) using clear mathematical reasoning.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many bars each person received individually. With 12 bars shared equally among 3 people:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12/3\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12/3\"},\n    \"result\": 4.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nLet me argue for answer B (8.0) using clear mathematical reasoning.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many bars each person received individually.

The alternative answer of 4 bars would mean they shared a single person's portion, which contradicts the premise that the bars were shared equally between all three people individually.\n"
