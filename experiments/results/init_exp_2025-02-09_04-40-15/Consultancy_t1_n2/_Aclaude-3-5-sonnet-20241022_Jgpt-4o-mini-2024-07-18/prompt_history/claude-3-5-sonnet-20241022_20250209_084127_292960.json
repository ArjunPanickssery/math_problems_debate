How long was each part in inches if 1 foot is equal to 12 inches?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 16.0\nFive feet is equal to 5 feet x 12 inches/foot = 60 inches.\nSo, the total length of the wire was 60 inches + 4 inches = 64 inches.\nHence, each part is 64 inches / 4 parts = 16 inches/part.\n#### 16\n(A): 16.2\nConvert the length to decimal feet: 5 feet 4 inches = 5.4 feet\nConvert to inches by multiplying by 12: 5.4 \u00d7 12 = 64.8 inches\nDivide by 4 parts: 64.8 \u00f7 4 = 16.2 inches\n#### 16.2\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 16.2\nConvert the length to decimal feet: 5 feet 4 inches = 5.4 feet\nConvert to inches by multiplying by 12: 5.4 \u00d7 12 = 64.8 inches\nDivide by 4 parts: 64.8 \u00f7 4 = 16.2 inches\n#### 16.2"
