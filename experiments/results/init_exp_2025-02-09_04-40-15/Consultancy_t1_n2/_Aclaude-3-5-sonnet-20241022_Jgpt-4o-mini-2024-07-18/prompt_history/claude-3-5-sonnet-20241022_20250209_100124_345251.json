What is the combined length of the CDs?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 6.0\nThe long CD is 1.5*2=3 hours\nThe two shorter CDs have a combined length of 1.5*2=3 hours\nSo in total the CDs had a length of 3+3= 6 hours\n#### 6\n(B): 4.5\nThe long CD is 1.5*2=3 hours\nThe short CDs have a length of 1.5 hours\nSo in total the CDs had a length of 3+1.5=4.5 hours\n#### 4.5\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 6.0\nThe long CD is 1.5*2=3 hours\nThe two shorter CDs have a combined length of 1.5*2=3 hours\nSo in total the CDs had a length of 3+3= 6 hours\n#### 6"
