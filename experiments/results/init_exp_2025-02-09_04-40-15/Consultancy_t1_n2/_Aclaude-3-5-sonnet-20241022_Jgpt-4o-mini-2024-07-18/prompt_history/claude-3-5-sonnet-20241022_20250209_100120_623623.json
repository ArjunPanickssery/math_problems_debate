How tall is he in feet?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 6.0\nHe gained 2*3=6 inches\nSo his height is 66+6=72 inches\nSo he is 72/12=6 feet tall\n#### 6\n(B): 17.0\nFirst find total change in height:\n(66+2)*3 = 68*3 = 204 inches\nConvert to feet: 204/12 = 17 feet\n#### 17.0\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 17.0\nFirst find total change in height:\n(66+2)*3 = 68*3 = 204 inches\nConvert to feet: 204/12 = 17 feet\n#### 17.0"
