How much more money does he make per year in his new job than the old job if he works 52 weeks a year?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 20800.0\nHe makes 20*40=$800 per week\nHe used to make 16*25=$400 per week\nSo his raise was 800-400=$400 per week\nSo he makes 400*52=$20,800 per year more\n#### 20800\n(A): 8320\nLet's find the difference in pay rate: 20-16 = 4\nMultiply by hours worked: 4*40 = 160\nMultiply by weeks per year: 160*52 = 8320\n#### 8320\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 8320\nLet's find the difference in pay rate: 20-16 = 4\nMultiply by hours worked: 4*40 = 160\nMultiply by weeks per year: 160*52 = 8320\n#### 8320"
