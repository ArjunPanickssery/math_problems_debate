      "content": "QUESTION: John buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students.  He has 6 classes and 30 students in each class.  How many packs did he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 360.0\nJohn has 6*30=180 students\nSo he bought 180*2=360 packs\n#### 360\n(A): 12.0\nCalculate number of classes: 6\nMultiply by 2 packs per class: 6*2=12\n#### 12\n## Argument in favour of B\nJohn buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students, not per class. The question specifies that he has 6 classes with 30 students each, totaling 180 students. Since he buys 2 packs for each student, the correct calculation is 180 students multiplied by 2 packs, resulting in 360 packs. The answer (B) is correct because it accurately reflects the total number of packs needed for all students across all classes. Answer (A) incorrectly assumes the purchase is per class rather than per student, leading to an underestimation.\n"
