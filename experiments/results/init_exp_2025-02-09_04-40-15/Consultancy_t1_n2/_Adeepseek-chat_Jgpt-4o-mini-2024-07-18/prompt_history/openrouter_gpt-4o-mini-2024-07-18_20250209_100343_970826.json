      "content": "QUESTION: A housewife goes to the market. She spent 2/3 of her $150. How much does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50\n(A): 100.0\nFirst calculate what fraction remains: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\nSince 2/3 was spent, multiply $150 by 2/3: $150 * (2/3) = $100\nThis is the amount she has left.\n#### 100\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe housewife spent 2/3 of her $150, which means she has 1/3 of her money left. To find out how much she has remaining, we calculate 1/3 of $150: $150 * (1/3) = $50. This is the correct amount she has left after her spending. The other answer, $100, incorrectly multiplies $150 by 2/3, which represents the amount spent, not the amount remaining. Therefore, the correct answer is $50, as it accurately reflects the remaining fraction of her money.\n"
