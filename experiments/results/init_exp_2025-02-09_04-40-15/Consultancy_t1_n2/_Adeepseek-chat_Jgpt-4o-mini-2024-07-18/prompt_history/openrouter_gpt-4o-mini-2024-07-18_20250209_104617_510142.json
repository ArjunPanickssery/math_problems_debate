      "content": "QUESTION: Maria bought a ticket to a ZOO. The regular price stands at $15, but she was able to get a 40% discount. How much did Maria pay for the ticket?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 9.0\nThe discount Maria got was 40/100 * 15 = $6.\nThat means the price for her ticket was 15 - 6 = $9.\n#### 9\n(B): 6.0\nA 40% discount means the price is 40/100 of the original amount.\n40/100 * 15 = $6\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of A\nMaria paid $9 for the ticket because the correct calculation involves subtracting the discount from the original price. The original price is $15, and a 40% discount means she saves 40/100 * 15 = $6. Therefore, the final price she pays is $15 - $6 = $9. Answer (B) incorrectly assumes the discount is the final price, but a discount reduces the original price, not replaces it. Thus, the accurate amount Maria paid is $9, making (A) the correct answer.\n"
