      "content": "QUESTION: John was 66 inches tall.  He had a growth spurt and grew 2 inches per month for 3 months.  How tall is he in feet?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 6.0\nHe gained 2*3=6 inches\nSo his height is 66+6=72 inches\nSo he is 72/12=6 feet tall\n#### 6\n(B): 17.0\nFirst find total change in height:\n(66+2)*3 = 68*3 = 204 inches\nConvert to feet: 204/12 = 17 feet\n#### 17.0\n## Argument in favour of A\nJohn's initial height is 66 inches. He grows 2 inches per month for 3 months, so his total growth is 2 * 3 = 6 inches. Adding this to his initial height, 66 + 6 = 72 inches. Converting inches to feet, 72 / 12 = 6 feet. The calculation is straightforward and follows the correct order of operations. Answer (B) incorrectly adds 2 inches to 66 inches before multiplying by 3, which misrepresents the problem. The correct interpretation is that John grows 2 inches each month for 3 months, not that his entire height increases by 2 inches per month. Therefore, (A) is the correct answer.\n"
