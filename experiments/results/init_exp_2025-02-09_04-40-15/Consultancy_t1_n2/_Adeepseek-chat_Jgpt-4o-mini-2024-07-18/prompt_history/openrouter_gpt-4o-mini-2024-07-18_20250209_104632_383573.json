      "content": "QUESTION: Tom needs to lower a rope down 6 stories.   One story is 10 feet.  The only rope being sold is 20 feet long but you lose 25% when lashing them together.  How many pieces of rope will he need to buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet\nHe loses 20*.25=5 feet each time\nSo he gets 20-5=15 feet from each piece\nThat means he needs 60/15=4 pieces of rope\n#### 4\n(A): 3.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet of rope total\nEach piece of rope is 20 feet\nTherefore he needs 60/20=3 pieces of rope\n#### 3\n## Argument in favour of B\nTom needs a total of 60 feet of rope to cover 6 stories, with each story being 10 feet. The rope available is 20 feet long, but when lashed together, he loses 25% of the length, which is 5 feet per piece. This means each piece effectively provides only 15 feet of usable rope. To cover 60 feet, he needs 60 divided by 15, which equals 4 pieces of rope. The calculation is straightforward: 60 feet required divided by 15 feet per piece equals 4 pieces. Therefore, the correct answer is 4.0.\n"
