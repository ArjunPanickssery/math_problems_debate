      "content": "QUESTION: Steve decides to read a new book.  He reads 100 pages Monday, Wed, and Friday.  The book is 2100 pages long.  How many weeks does it take to read them all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 7.0\nHe reads 100*3=300 pages a week\nSo it would take 2100/300=7 weeks to read the book\n#### 7\n(A): 3.0\nFirst calculate pages per day: 100 pages\nTotal segments needed: 2100/100 = 21\nDivide by days in a week: 21/7 = 3 weeks\n#### 3\n## Argument in favour of B\nSteve reads 100 pages on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, totaling 300 pages per week. The book is 2100 pages long. To determine the number of weeks needed, divide the total pages by the weekly reading rate: 2100 / 300 = 7 weeks. This calculation accurately reflects Steve's consistent reading schedule and the total length of the book. The answer (B) is correct because it correctly accounts for the number of pages read each week and the total pages to be read. The alternative answer (A) incorrectly divides by days in a week, which is irrelevant given the specific reading days.\n"
