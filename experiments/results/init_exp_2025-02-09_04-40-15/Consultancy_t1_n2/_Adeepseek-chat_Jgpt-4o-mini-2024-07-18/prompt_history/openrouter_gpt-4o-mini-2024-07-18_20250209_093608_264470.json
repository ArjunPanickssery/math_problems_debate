      "content": "QUESTION: A box of chocolate bars was shared equally between Mike, Rita and Anita. If the box contains 12 bars, how many bars did Mike and Rita get (combined)?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 8.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nMike and Rita together got 4+4 = 8 bars\n#### 8\n(A): 4.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nSince Mike and Rita shared the bars, they got 4 bars together\n#### 4\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is (B): 8.0. The box contains 12 chocolate bars, and they are shared equally among Mike, Rita, and Anita. This means each person receives 12 divided by 3, which is 4 bars. Mike and Rita are two people, so together they receive 4 bars (Mike) + 4 bars (Rita) = 8 bars. The question specifically asks for the combined total for Mike and Rita, not individually. Therefore, the correct answer is 8.0. Answer (A) is incorrect because it mistakenly suggests that Mike and Rita together received only 4 bars, which is the amount one person receives.\n"
