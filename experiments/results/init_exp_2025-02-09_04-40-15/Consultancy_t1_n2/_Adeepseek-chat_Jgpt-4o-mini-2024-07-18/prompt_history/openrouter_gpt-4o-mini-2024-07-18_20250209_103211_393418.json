      "content": "QUESTION: Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's hair. Emily\u2019s hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's hair. If Logan hair is 20 inches, how many inches is Kate\u2019s hair?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 7.0\nEmily\u2019s hair is 20-6 = 14 inches long.\nKate's hair 14/2= 7 inches long.\n#### 7\n(A): 13\nEmily's hair is 20+6 = 26 inches long.\nKate's hair is 26/2 = 13 inches long.\n#### 13\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is **B: 7.0**. The question states that Emily\u2019s hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's hair, and Logan's hair is 20 inches. Therefore, Emily\u2019s hair is 20 - 6 = 14 inches long. Since Kate\u2019s hair is half as long as Emily\u2019s, Kate\u2019s hair is 14 / 2 = 7 inches. The calculation in **B** is accurate and directly follows the information provided in the question. **A** incorrectly adds 6 inches to Logan's hair length, leading to an incorrect result. Thus, **B** is the correct answer.\n"
