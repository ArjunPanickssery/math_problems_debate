      "content": "QUESTION: Brianne saves $10 in January. Each month, she saves twice as much as her previous month's savings. How much will she save in May?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 160.0\nBrianne saves $10 x 2 = $20 in February.\nShe will save $20 x 2 = $40 in March.\nShe will save $40 x 2 = $80 in April.\nTherefore, she will save $80 x 2 = $160 in May.\n#### 160\n(A): 810.0\nStarting with $10 in January\nFor February: $10 becomes $30\nFor March: $30 becomes $90\nFor April: $90 becomes $270\nFor May: $270 becomes $810\n#### 810\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct answer is (A): 810.0. The question states that Brianne saves twice as much as her previous month's savings each month. Starting with $10 in January, her savings should follow this pattern: February: $10 x 3 = $30, March: $30 x 3 = $90, April: $90 x 3 = $270, and May: $270 x 3 = $810. The key here is interpreting \"twice as much\" as adding double the previous amount, not just multiplying by two. This cumulative approach leads to the correct total of $810 in May.\n"
