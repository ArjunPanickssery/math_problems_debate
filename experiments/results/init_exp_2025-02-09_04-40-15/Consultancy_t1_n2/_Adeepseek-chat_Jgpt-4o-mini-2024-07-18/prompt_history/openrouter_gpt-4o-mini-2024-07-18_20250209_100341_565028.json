      "content": "QUESTION: My dog was born when I was 15 years old. Two years from now, my dog will turn 4 years old. How old am I now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 17.0\nIn 2 years, my dog will be 4 years old, so my dog is 4 - 2 = 2 years old now.\nSo I am 15 + 2 = 17 years old now.\n#### 17\n(B): 19.0\nI was 15 when my dog was born. My dog will be 4 years old in 2 years.\nSo my current age is 15 + 4 = 19 years old.\n#### 19\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct answer is (A): 17.0. The reasoning is straightforward: if the dog will be 4 years old in 2 years, then the dog is currently 2 years old. Since the dog was born when I was 15, adding the dog's current age to my age at that time gives my current age: 15 + 2 = 17. This aligns perfectly with the information provided. Answer (B) incorrectly adds the dog's future age (4) to my age at the dog's birth (15), which is a misinterpretation of the timeline. Therefore, (A) is the correct answer.\n"
