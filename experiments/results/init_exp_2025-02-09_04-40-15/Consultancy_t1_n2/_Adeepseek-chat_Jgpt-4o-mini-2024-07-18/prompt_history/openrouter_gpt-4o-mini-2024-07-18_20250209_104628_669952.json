      "content": "QUESTION: There are 14 red crayons, 5 more blue crayons than red crayons, and 6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons.  How many yellow crayons are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 32.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:5+14=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)-6=32 crayons\n#### 32\n(A): 44.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:14+5=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)+6=44 crayons\n#### 44\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is (B): 32.0. The problem states there are 14 red crayons. Blue crayons are 5 more than red, so 14 + 5 = 19. Yellow crayons are 6 less than double the blue crayons, so 19 * 2 - 6 = 32. This calculation follows the problem's instructions precisely. Answer (A) incorrectly adds 6 instead of subtracting, leading to an incorrect total of 44. The problem explicitly says \"6 less,\" not \"6 more,\" making (B) the accurate and logical choice based on the given information.\n"
