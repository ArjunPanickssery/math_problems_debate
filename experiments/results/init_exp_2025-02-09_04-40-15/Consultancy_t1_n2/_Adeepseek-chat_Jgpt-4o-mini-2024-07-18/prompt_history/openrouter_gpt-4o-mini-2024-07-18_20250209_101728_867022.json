      "content": "QUESTION: In Sam's first 100 matches he won 50% of matches.  In his next 100 games, he won 60% of matches.  How many total matches did he win?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 110.0\nHe won 100*.5=50 matches in his first 100 games\nIn his next 100 games, he won 100*.6=60 matches\nSo in total, he won 50+60=110 matches\n#### 110\n(A): 120.0\nSam's final win rate was 60%\nThis means across all 200 matches, he won 200 * 0.6 = 120 matches\n#### 120\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is (B): 110.0. The question explicitly states that Sam won 50% of his first 100 matches, which is 50 wins, and 60% of his next 100 matches, which is 60 wins. Adding these together gives a total of 110 wins. The answer (A): 120.0 is incorrect because it misinterprets the question by assuming a final win rate of 60% across all 200 matches, which is not supported by the given information. The question clearly separates the two sets of matches, so the total wins must be calculated separately and then summed.\n"
