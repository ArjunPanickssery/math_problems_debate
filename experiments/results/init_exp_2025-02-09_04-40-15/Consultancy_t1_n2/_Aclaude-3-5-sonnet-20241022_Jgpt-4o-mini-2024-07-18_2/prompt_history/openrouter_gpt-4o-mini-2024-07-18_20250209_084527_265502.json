      "content": "QUESTION: John wants to finish a show in 5 days.  There are 20 episodes and they are each 30 minutes long.  How many hours does he have to watch a day?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2.0\nHe wants to watch 20*30=600 minutes\nSo he needs to watch 600/60=10 hours\nThat means he needs to watch 10/5=2 hours a day\n#### 2\n(B): 1.2\nFirst find total minutes: 20 * 30 = 600 minutes\nConvert to hours: 600 / 100 = 6 hours total\nDivide by 5 days: 6 / 5 = 1.2 hours per day\n#### 1.2\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe calculation showing 2 hours per day is mathematically correct. When converting minutes to hours, we must divide by 60 (minutes per hour), not 100 as suggested in answer B. The total time is 600 minutes, which equals 10 hours (600/60 = 10). Dividing this by 5 days gives us 2 hours per day. This is the only mathematically sound approach, as using 100 as a conversion factor between minutes and hours is fundamentally incorrect - there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is a universal constant that cannot be changed.\n"
