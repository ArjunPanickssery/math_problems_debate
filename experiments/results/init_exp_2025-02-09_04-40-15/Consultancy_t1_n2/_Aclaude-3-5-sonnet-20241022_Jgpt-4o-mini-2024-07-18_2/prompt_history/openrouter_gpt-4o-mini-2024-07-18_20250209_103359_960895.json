      "content": "QUESTION: June made a design with 20 equal tiles. Three tiles are yellow and the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles. Six tiles are purple and the remaining tiles are white.  How many white tiles are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 7.0\nThere are 3 + 1 = 4 blue tiles.\nThere are a total of 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 tiles are yellow, blue, and purple.\nHence, 20 - 13 = 7 tiles are white.\n#### 7\n(B): 10.0\nThe yellow and blue tiles together total 3 + 1 = 4 tiles.\nAdding the purple tiles gives us 4 + 6 = 10 colored tiles.\nTherefore, 20 - 10 = 10 tiles must be white.\n#### 10\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe calculation in answer A is the mathematically correct approach. When we're told there are \"three tiles are yellow and the number of blue tiles is one more,\" this means there are 3 yellow tiles and 4 blue tiles (one more than yellow). Together with 6 purple tiles, this makes 13 colored tiles (3 + 4 + 6 = 13). Since there are 20 tiles in total, subtracting the colored tiles (20 - 13) gives us 7 white tiles. Answer B makes the critical error of assuming \"one more than yellow\" means just 1 blue tile total, rather than understanding it means 4 blue tiles (one more than the 3 yellow tiles).\n"
