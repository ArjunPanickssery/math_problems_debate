      "content": "QUESTION: Henry believes in the famous phrase, \"An apple a day, keeps the doctor away.\" If a box contains 14 apples, how many weeks can Henry and his brother spend eating 3 boxes of apples if they each eat 1 apple a day?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 3.0\nThere are a total of 14 apples/box x 3 boxes = 42 apples in the 3 boxes.\nSo, Henry and his brother each have 42 apples / 2 people = 21 apples/person to consume.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, thus, both of them can consume the 3 boxes of apples in 21 / 7 = 3 weeks.\n#### 3\n(B): 6.0\nThere are a total of 14 apples/box \u00d7 3 boxes = 42 apples in the 3 boxes.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, the number of weeks the apples will last is:\n42 apples \u00f7 7 days/week = 6 weeks\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe calculation in Answer A is the correct mathematical approach because it properly accounts for both Henry AND his brother eating one apple each per day. With 42 total apples and two people consuming them daily, we must divide the total by 2 to get the number of days the supply will last per person (21 days). Since we're asked about weeks, we then divide 21 by 7, giving us 3 weeks. Answer B fails to account for the fact that two people are eating apples daily, which would deplete the supply twice as fast. It incorrectly assumes only one apple is being consumed per day, when in fact two are being consumed.\n"
