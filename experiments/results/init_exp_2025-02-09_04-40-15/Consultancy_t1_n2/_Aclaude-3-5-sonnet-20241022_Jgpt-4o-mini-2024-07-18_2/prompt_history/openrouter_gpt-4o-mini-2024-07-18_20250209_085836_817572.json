      "content": "QUESTION: A housewife goes to the market. She spent 2/3 of her $150. How much does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50\n(A): 100.0\nFirst calculate what fraction remains: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\nSince 2/3 was spent, multiply $150 by 2/3: $150 * (2/3) = $100\nThis is the amount she has left.\n#### 100\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe calculation for answer B is mathematically sound and follows clear logical steps. When the housewife spends 2/3 of her money, she naturally has 1/3 remaining. This can be verified by subtracting 2/3 from the total (3/3): 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3. To find the dollar amount remaining, we multiply the original amount ($150) by the remaining fraction (1/3), which equals $50. This is basic fraction arithmetic that follows the principle of parts of a whole. The other answer incorrectly multiplies by the spent portion rather than the remaining portion.\n"
