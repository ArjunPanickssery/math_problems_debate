      "content": "QUESTION: Olaf is sailing across the ocean with 25 men, including himself. He needs 1/2 a gallon of water per day per man. The boat can go 200 miles per day and he needs to travel 4,000 miles. How many gallons of water does he need?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 250.0\nHe needs 12.5 gallons per day because 25 x .5 = 12.5\nIt will take 20 days of travel because 4,000 / 200 = 20\nHe will need 250 gallons of water because 20 x 12.5 = 250\n#### 250\n(B): 500.0\nCalculate travel time: 4,000 / 200 = 20 days\nFor complete journey (there and back): 20 x 2 = 40 days\nDaily water needs: 25 x 0.5 = 12.5 gallons\nTotal water required: 40 x 12.5 = 500 gallons\n#### 500\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe answer is clearly 250 gallons of water. The question specifically asks about sailing \"across\" the ocean, which implies a one-way journey. There's no mention of a return trip in the problem statement. When we say someone is going \"across\" something, we mean from one side to the other, not back and forth. The calculation is straightforward: 25 men need 12.5 gallons per day, and the journey takes 20 days to cover 4,000 miles at 200 miles per day. Therefore, 12.5 gallons \u00d7 20 days = 250 gallons total. Adding a return journey would be making assumptions beyond what the question asks.\n"
