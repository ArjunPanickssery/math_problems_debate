      "content": "QUESTION: There are 14 red crayons, 5 more blue crayons than red crayons, and 6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons.  How many yellow crayons are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 32.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:5+14=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)-6=32 crayons\n#### 32\n(A): 44.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:14+5=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)+6=44 crayons\n#### 44\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe calculation showing 32 yellow crayons is correct. Let's break it down: We have 14 red crayons, and there are 5 more blue crayons than red, giving us 19 blue crayons (14 + 5 = 19). The question states there are 6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons. So we first double the blue crayons (19 \u00d7 2 = 38), then subtract 6 to get the number of yellow crayons (38 - 6 = 32). The other answer incorrectly adds 6 instead of subtracting it, which contradicts the phrase \"6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons.\"\n"
