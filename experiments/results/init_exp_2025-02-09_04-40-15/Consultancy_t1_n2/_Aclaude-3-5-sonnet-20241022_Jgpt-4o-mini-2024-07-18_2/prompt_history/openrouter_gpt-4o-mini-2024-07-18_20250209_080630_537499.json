      "content": "QUESTION: Tom needs to lower a rope down 6 stories.   One story is 10 feet.  The only rope being sold is 20 feet long but you lose 25% when lashing them together.  How many pieces of rope will he need to buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet\nHe loses 20*.25=5 feet each time\nSo he gets 20-5=15 feet from each piece\nThat means he needs 60/15=4 pieces of rope\n#### 4\n(A): 3.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet of rope total\nEach piece of rope is 20 feet\nTherefore he needs 60/20=3 pieces of rope\n#### 3\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe calculation must account for the 25% loss when lashing ropes together. With 6 stories at 10 feet each, Tom needs 60 feet total. Each 20-foot piece of rope loses 25% (5 feet) when connected, leaving 15 feet of usable length per piece. Therefore, to reach 60 feet, we need 60\u00f715=4 pieces of rope. Answer A incorrectly ignores the crucial loss factor when connecting ropes, which would leave Tom with insufficient length to reach the ground. The 25% loss is a critical safety consideration that cannot be overlooked when working with heights.\n"
