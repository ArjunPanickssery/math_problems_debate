      "content": "QUESTION: Maria bought a ticket to a ZOO. The regular price stands at $15, but she was able to get a 40% discount. How much did Maria pay for the ticket?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 9.0\nThe discount Maria got was 40/100 * 15 = $6.\nThat means the price for her ticket was 15 - 6 = $9.\n#### 9\n(B): 6.0\nA 40% discount means the price is 40/100 of the original amount.\n40/100 * 15 = $6\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe calculation in answer A is the correct mathematical approach to finding a discounted price. When calculating a discount, we first determine the amount being taken off (40% of $15 = $6) and then subtract that from the original price ($15 - $6 = $9). This follows the standard retail pricing formula where a percentage discount represents the portion being removed from the original price, not the final price itself. The alternative interpretation would mean Maria got a 60% discount, which is clearly not what the question stated. The $9 answer represents exactly what Maria would pay after a 40% reduction from $15.\n"
