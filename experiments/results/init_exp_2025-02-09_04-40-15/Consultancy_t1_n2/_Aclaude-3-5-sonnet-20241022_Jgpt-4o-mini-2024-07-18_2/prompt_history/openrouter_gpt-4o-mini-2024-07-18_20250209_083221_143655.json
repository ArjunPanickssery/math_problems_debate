      "content": "QUESTION: Maria bought a ticket to a ZOO. The regular price stands at $15, but she was able to get a 40% discount. How much did Maria pay for the ticket?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 9.0\nThe discount Maria got was 40/100 * 15 = $6.\nThat means the price for her ticket was 15 - 6 = $9.\n#### 9\n(B): 6.0\nA 40% discount means the price is 40/100 of the original amount.\n40/100 * 15 = $6\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of B\nA 40% discount means you pay 40% of the original price, not subtract 40%. This is a common misconception. When we say something is \"40% off,\" we mean you pay 40% of the listed price. Therefore, we simply calculate 40% of $15, which is (40/100) \u00d7 $15 = $6. This is the final amount Maria needs to pay. The other calculation method incorrectly assumes you subtract the discount from the original price, but that would be for a 60% discount, not a 40% discount. The terminology \"40% discount\" directly translates to paying 40% of the price.\n"
