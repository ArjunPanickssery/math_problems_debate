      "content": "QUESTION: Tim has some cans of soda. Jeff comes by, and takes 6 cans of soda from Tim. Tim then goes and buys another half the amount of soda cans he had left. If Tim has 24 cans of soda in the end, how many cans of soda did Tim have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 22.0\nLet x be the number of cans Tim has at first.\nAfter Jeff comes by, Tim has x-6 cans left.\nTim buys another (x-6)/2 cans.\nx-6+(x-6)/2=24\n2*x-12+x-6=48\n3*x-18=48\n3*x=66\nx=22\n#### 22\n(A): 20.0\nx - 6 + x/2 = 24\n2x - 12 + x = 48\n3x = 60\nx = 20\n#### 20\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe calculation in answer A is the correct mathematical representation of the problem. When Tim buys \"half the amount of soda cans he had left,\" this means he's buying half of his original amount (x/2), not half of what remained after Jeff took 6 cans. The equation x - 6 + x/2 = 24 properly represents this sequence: starting amount (x), minus Jeff's 6 cans (x - 6), plus half of the original amount (x/2). This leads to 20 cans as the initial amount, which we can verify: 20 - 6 = 14, then 14 + 10 = 24 cans at the end. Answer B incorrectly interprets \"half the amount left\" as (x-6)/2.\n"
