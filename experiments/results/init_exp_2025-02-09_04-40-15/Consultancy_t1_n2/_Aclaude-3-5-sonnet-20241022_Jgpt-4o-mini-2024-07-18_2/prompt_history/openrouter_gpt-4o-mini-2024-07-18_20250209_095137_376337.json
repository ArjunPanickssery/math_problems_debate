      "content": "QUESTION: A farm has 5 less than 9 times the amount of hens as roosters.  If there are 75 total chickens, how many hens are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 67.0\nLet x represent the number of roosters\nNumber of hens:9x-5\nTotal:9x-5+x=75\n10x-5=75\n10x=80\nx=8\nNumber of hens: 9(8)-5=67\n#### 67\n(B): 68.0\nLet x represent the number of roosters\nNumber of hens: 9x+5\nTotal: 9x+5+x=75\n10x+5=75\n10x=70\nx=7\nNumber of hens: 9(7)+5=68\n#### 68\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe key phrase \"5 less than 9 times\" should be interpreted as \"9x+5\" because when we say something is \"less than\" in mathematics, we're describing a subtraction operation from a larger number. In this case, we start with 9 times the roosters (9x) and then add 5 to get the number of hens. This leads to the equation 10x+5=75, where x=7 roosters. Therefore, there are 68 hens (9\u00d77+5=68). This interpretation is mathematically sound and follows the standard order of operations, making 68 the correct answer.\n"
