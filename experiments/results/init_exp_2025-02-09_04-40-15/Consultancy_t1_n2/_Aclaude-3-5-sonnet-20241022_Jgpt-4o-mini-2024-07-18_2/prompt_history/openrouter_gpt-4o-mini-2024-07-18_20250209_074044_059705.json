      "content": "QUESTION: It takes 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit. If Lydia planted a tree when she was 4 years old and is now 9 years old, how old would she be when she gets to eat an apple from her tree for the first time?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 11.0\nThe tree has been planted for 9 - 4 = 5 years\nIt will take another 7 - 5 = 2 years for it to bear fruit\nLydia will be 9 + 2 = 11 years old\n#### 11\n(B): 16.0\nStarting from her current age of 9\nIt takes 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit\nHer age will be 9 + 7 = 16 when she can eat the apples\n#### 16\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe calculation must start from when Lydia planted the tree at age 4, not her current age. The tree has already been growing for 5 years (from age 4 to 9), so we only need to wait another 2 years to reach the full 7-year maturation period. It's like starting a 7-hour countdown timer 5 hours ago - you only need to wait 2 more hours, not start a new 7-hour countdown now. Therefore, Lydia will be 11 years old (her current age of 9 plus the remaining 2 years) when she can eat apples from her tree.\n"
