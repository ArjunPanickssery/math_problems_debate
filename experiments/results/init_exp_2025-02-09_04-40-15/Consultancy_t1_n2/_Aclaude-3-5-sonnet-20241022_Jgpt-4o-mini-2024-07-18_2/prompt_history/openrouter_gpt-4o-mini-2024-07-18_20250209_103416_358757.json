      "content": "QUESTION: The bowling alley has 30 red bowling balls. There are 6 more green bowling balls than red. How many bowling balls are there in total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 66.0\nThere are 30 + 6 = 36 green bowling balls\nIn total there are 30 + 36 = 66 bowling balls\n#### 66\n(B): 72.0\nThere are 30 red bowling balls\nFor green balls, we add 6 more than red, so 30 + 6 = 36 green balls\nTotal is 30 + 36 + 6 = 72 bowling balls\n#### 72\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe calculation in answer A is mathematically sound and follows the problem's logic precisely. There are 30 red bowling balls, and the number of green balls is 6 more than red, meaning 36 green balls. When we add these together (30 + 36), we get 66 total bowling balls. Answer B makes the critical error of adding the number 6 twice - once when calculating the green balls and again in the final sum. This double-counting creates an artificial inflation of the total by 6 balls. The question only asks for the sum of red and green balls, making 66 the correct answer.\n"
