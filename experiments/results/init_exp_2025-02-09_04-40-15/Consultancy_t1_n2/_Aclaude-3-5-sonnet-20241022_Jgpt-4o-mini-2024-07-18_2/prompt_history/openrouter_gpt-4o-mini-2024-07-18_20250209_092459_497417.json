      "content": "QUESTION: Laura bought 2 pairs of pants for $54 each and 4 shirts for $33 each. She gave $250 to the cashier. So how much change did she take?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 10.0\n54*2=$108 is the price of 2 pairs of pants.\n4*33=$132 is the price of 4 shirts.\n108+132=$240 is the total price.\nSo the cashier gave 250-240=$10 change to Laura.\n#### 10\n(A): -32\n33*2=$66 is the price of 2 pairs of pants\n4*54=$216 is the price of 4 shirts\n66+216=$282 is the total price\nSo 250-282=$-32 is the change\n#### -32\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe calculation in answer B is clearly correct. Laura bought 2 pairs of pants at $54 each, totaling $108, and 4 shirts at $33 each, totaling $132. The total purchase amount was therefore $240. Since she gave $250 to the cashier, she would receive $10 in change. Answer A makes the critical error of mixing up the prices, incorrectly assigning the shirt price to the pants and vice versa. This completely invalidates their calculation. The problem clearly states that pants cost $54 and shirts cost $33, not the other way around.\n"
