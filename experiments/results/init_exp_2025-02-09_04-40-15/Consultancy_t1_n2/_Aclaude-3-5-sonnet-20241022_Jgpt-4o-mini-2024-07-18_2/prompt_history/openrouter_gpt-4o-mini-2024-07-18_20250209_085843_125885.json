      "content": "QUESTION: 4.5 gallons of coffee were divided among 18 thermoses. Genevieve drank 3 thermoses. How many pints of coffee did Genevieve drink?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 6.0\n4.5 gallons = 4.5 * 8 pints = 36 pints\n36/18 = 2 pints\nGenevieve drank 2*3=6 pints of coffee.\n#### 6\n(A): 3.0\n4.5 gallons = 4.5 * 4 pints = 18 pints\n18/18 = 1 pint per thermos\nGenevieve drank 1*3 = 3 pints of coffee.\n#### 3\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe conversion rate of 4.5 gallons to pints is critical here, and it's important to note that 1 gallon equals 4 pints, not 8 pints. This is a fundamental conversion that can be verified in any standard measurement table. Using the correct conversion, 4.5 gallons equals 18 pints (4.5 \u00d7 4 = 18). When these 18 pints are divided among 18 thermoses, each thermos contains exactly 1 pint. Since Genevieve drank 3 thermoses, she consumed 3 pints of coffee (3 thermoses \u00d7 1 pint per thermos = 3 pints). Answer B incorrectly doubles the amount by using an incorrect conversion factor.\n"
