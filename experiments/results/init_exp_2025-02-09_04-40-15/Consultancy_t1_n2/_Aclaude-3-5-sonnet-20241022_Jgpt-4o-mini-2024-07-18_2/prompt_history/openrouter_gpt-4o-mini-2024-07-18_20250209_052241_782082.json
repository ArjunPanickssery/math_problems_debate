      "content": "QUESTION: Tim has some cans of soda. Jeff comes by, and takes 6 cans of soda from Tim. Tim then goes and buys another half the amount of soda cans he had left. If Tim has 24 cans of soda in the end, how many cans of soda did Tim have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 22.0\nLet x be the number of cans Tim has at first.\nAfter Jeff comes by, Tim has x-6 cans left.\nTim buys another (x-6)/2 cans.\nx-6+(x-6)/2=24\n2*x-12+x-6=48\n3*x-18=48\n3*x=66\nx=22\n#### 22\n(A): 20.0\nx - 6 + x/2 = 24\n2x - 12 + x = 48\n3x = 60\nx = 20\n#### 20\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe key to solving this problem lies in carefully following the sequence of events and properly accounting for the \"half the amount left\" calculation. When Tim starts with 22 cans and Jeff takes 6, Tim has 16 cans left. Tim then buys half of 16 (which is 8) additional cans. This brings the total to 24 cans (16 + 8 = 24). The equation 3x - 18 = 48 correctly represents this scenario because it accounts for the original amount (x), minus Jeff's 6 cans (x-6), plus half of what remained ((x-6)/2). This equation solves to x = 22, which perfectly matches our step-by-step verification. Answer A incorrectly calculates the \"half amount\" based on the original number rather than the remaining cans after Jeff's visit.\n"
