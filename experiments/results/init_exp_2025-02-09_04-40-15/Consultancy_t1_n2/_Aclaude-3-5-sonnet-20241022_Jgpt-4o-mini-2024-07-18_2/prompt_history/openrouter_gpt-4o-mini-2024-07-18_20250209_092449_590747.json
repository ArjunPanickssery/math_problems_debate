      "content": "QUESTION: Hilary is shucking corn from ears that grew on her farm. She gets four ears of corn per stalk, and she has 108 stalks growing. Half the ears of corn have 500 kernels of corn and the other half have 100 more. How many kernels of corn does Hilary have to shuck?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 237600.0\nShe has 108 * 4 = 432 ears of corn to shuck.\nShe gets 500 kernels of corn from half the ears and 500 + 100 = 600 kernels from the other half.\nHalf the number of ears of corn is 432 / 2 = 216 ears.\nThus, Hilary has 216 * 500 + 216 * 600 = 108000 + 129600 = 237600 kernels to shuck.\n#### 237600\n(B): 259200\nShe has 108 * 4 = 432 ears of corn to shuck.\nEach ear of corn has 500 kernels as a base amount.\nAdding the additional 100 kernels to each ear gives 600 kernels per ear.\nThus, Hilary has 432 * 600 = 259200 kernels to shuck.\n#### 259200\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe calculation in answer B is the correct approach because the question states \"the other half have 100 more.\" This means they have 100 more kernels than the base amount of 500, making it 600 kernels per ear. Since all ears start with 500 kernels, and then half get an additional 100, the total per ear is 600 kernels. With 432 total ears of corn (108 stalks \u00d7 4 ears per stalk), multiplying by 600 kernels gives us 259,200 kernels. Answer A incorrectly splits the calculation, treating half the ears as having only 500 kernels when they all have at least 500 plus the additional 100 on half of them.\n"
