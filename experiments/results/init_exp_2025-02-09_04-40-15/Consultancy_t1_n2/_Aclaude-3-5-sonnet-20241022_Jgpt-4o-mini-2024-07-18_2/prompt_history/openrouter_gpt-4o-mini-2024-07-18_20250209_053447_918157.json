      "content": "QUESTION: A box of chocolate bars was shared equally between Mike, Rita and Anita. If the box contains 12 bars, how many bars did Mike and Rita get (combined)?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 8.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nMike and Rita together got 4+4 = 8 bars\n#### 8\n(A): 4.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nSince Mike and Rita shared the bars, they got 4 bars together\n#### 4\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe question specifically mentions that Mike and Rita \"shared\" the bars, which implies they split their portion between themselves, separate from Anita. When we divide 12 bars equally among three people (Mike+Rita as one party, and Anita), each party gets 6 bars. Mike and Rita then share their 6 bars equally, meaning they get 4 bars together, not individually. This interpretation is supported by the use of the word \"shared\" in the question, which suggests a further division between Mike and Rita, rather than treating them as separate recipients from the initial distribution.\n"
