      "content": "QUESTION: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 828.0\nA single watermelon would sell for $2 x 23 = $46\n60 watermelons would sell for $46 x 18 = $828\n#### 828\n(B): 1656\nSince these are $2 per pound watermelons, first calculate the base price:\n$2 x 23 = $46 per watermelon\nFor 18 watermelons: $46 x 18 = $828\nFinally, account for the per-pound pricing: $828 x 2 = $1656\n#### 1656\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe calculation in answer A is the correct approach. When selling items priced per pound, we first calculate the price per watermelon by multiplying the weight (23 pounds) by the price per pound ($2), giving us $46 per watermelon. Then, we simply multiply this by the number of watermelons (18) to get the total revenue of $828. Answer B makes the critical error of doubling the final amount, which essentially charges $4 per pound instead of $2. The per-pound pricing is already factored into the initial calculation of $46 per watermelon, so doubling it at the end is incorrect.\n"
