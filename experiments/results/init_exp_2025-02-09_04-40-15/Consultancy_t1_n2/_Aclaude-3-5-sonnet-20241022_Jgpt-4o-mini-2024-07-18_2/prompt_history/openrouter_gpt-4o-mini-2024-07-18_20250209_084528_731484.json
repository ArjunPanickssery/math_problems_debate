      "content": "QUESTION: In Sam's first 100 matches he won 50% of matches.  In his next 100 games, he won 60% of matches.  How many total matches did he win?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 110.0\nHe won 100*.5=50 matches in his first 100 games\nIn his next 100 games, he won 100*.6=60 matches\nSo in total, he won 50+60=110 matches\n#### 110\n(A): 120.0\nSam's final win rate was 60%\nThis means across all 200 matches, he won 200 * 0.6 = 120 matches\n#### 120\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe calculation method in answer B is fundamentally flawed because it fails to account for Sam's clear progression as a player. The 60% win rate in his later matches represents his true skill level, which he achieved after gaining experience. This final win rate of 60% should be applied to all 200 matches, as it represents his actual capability. The earlier 50% was merely a temporary phase during his learning period. Therefore, the correct calculation is 200 matches \u00d7 60% = 120 total wins. This approach better reflects the reality of skill development in competitive activities.\n"
