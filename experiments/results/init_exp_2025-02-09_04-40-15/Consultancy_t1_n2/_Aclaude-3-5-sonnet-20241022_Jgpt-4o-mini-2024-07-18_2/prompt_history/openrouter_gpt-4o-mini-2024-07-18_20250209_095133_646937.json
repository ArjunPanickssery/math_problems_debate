      "content": "QUESTION: Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. If Mabel has 85 marbles, how many more marbles does Mabel have than Amanda?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 63.0\nKatrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles.\nTwice as many marbles as Katrina is 17 x 2 = 34\nAmanda has 34 -12 = 22 marbles.\nMabel has 85 - 22 = 63 more marbles than Amanda\n#### 63\n(B): 39.0\nKatrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles\nAmanda will have 17 \u00d7 2 + 12 = 46 marbles\nMabel has 85 - 46 = 39 more marbles than Amanda\n#### 39\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe key to this problem lies in correctly interpreting the phrase \"needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many.\" This means Amanda currently has 22 marbles, not 46. If Amanda needed 12 more to have twice Katrina's amount (34), then she must currently have 22 marbles (34 - 12 = 22). This is the crucial point where option B makes a mistake. They incorrectly add 12 to twice Katrina's amount, when in fact Amanda has 12 fewer than twice Katrina's amount. Therefore, Mabel (with 85 marbles) has 63 more marbles than Amanda (who has 22 marbles), making answer A correct.\n"
