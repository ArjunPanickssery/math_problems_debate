      "content": "QUESTION: There are 4,000 jelly beans in a jar. If three fourths of the jelly beans are red, and one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, how many jelly beans are coconut flavored?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 750.0\nThere are 4000/4*3=3000 red jelly beans.\nThere are 3000/4=750 coconut flavored jelly beans.\n#### 750\n(A): 1000.0\nFirst find one quarter of all jelly beans: 4000/4 = 1000\nSince these coconut ones must be among the red ones, and three fourths are red, \nthe coconut flavored ones are: 1000\n#### 1000\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe key insight is that the coconut-flavored jelly beans represent one quarter of all jelly beans in the jar. Since we know three-fourths are red, and one quarter of those red ones are coconut, this means that all coconut jelly beans must be red. When we calculate one quarter of the total (4000/4 = 1000), this directly gives us the number of coconut-flavored jelly beans. The alternative calculation method incorrectly applies the one-quarter fraction twice, leading to an underestimate. The problem states \"one quarter of the red jelly beans,\" but this is equivalent to one quarter of the total since all coconut ones are red.\n"
