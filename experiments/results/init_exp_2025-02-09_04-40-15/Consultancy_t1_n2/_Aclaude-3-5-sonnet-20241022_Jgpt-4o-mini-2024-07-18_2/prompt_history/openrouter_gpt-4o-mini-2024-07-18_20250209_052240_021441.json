      "content": "QUESTION: A box of chocolate bars was shared equally between Mike, Rita and Anita. If the box contains 12 bars, how many bars did Mike and Rita get (combined)?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 8.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nMike and Rita together got 4+4 = 8 bars\n#### 8\n(A): 4.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nSince Mike and Rita shared the bars, they got 4 bars together\n#### 4\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe answer is clearly 8 bars. When the box was shared equally between three people, each person received 4 bars (12 \u00f7 3 = 4). Since we're asked about Mike AND Rita's combined share, we must add their individual portions together: 4 + 4 = 8 bars. This is basic addition - when we want to find out how many items two people have together, we sum their individual amounts. The question specifically asks for their combined total, not what they shared between themselves. It would be illogical to suggest they only got 4 bars together when that's what each person received individually.\n"
