      "content": "QUESTION: John eats a bag of chips for dinner and then eats twice as many after dinner.  How many bags of chips did he eat?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 3.0\nHe ate 2 * 1 = 2 bags after dinner\nSo he ate 2 + 1 = 3 bags of chips\n#### 3\n(A): 2.0\nHe ate 1 bag for dinner\nApply the doubling: 1 * 2 = 2 bags in total\n#### 2\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe question asks for the total number of bags John ate, not the number of bags at each time period separately. When it says \"twice as many after dinner,\" this means the total amount after dinner is double the initial amount. If he ate 1 bag for dinner, then the total amount is that 1 bag multiplied by 2, which equals 2 bags total. This is similar to how a \"buy one, get one free\" deal results in 2 items total, not 3. The doubling applies to the entire quantity, not as an additional amount on top of the original.\n"
