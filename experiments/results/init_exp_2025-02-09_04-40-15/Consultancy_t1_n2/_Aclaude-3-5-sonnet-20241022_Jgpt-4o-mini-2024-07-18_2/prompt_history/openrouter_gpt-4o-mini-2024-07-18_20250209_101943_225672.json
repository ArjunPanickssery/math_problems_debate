      "content": "QUESTION: Sam has 18 cows.  5 more than half the cows are black.  How many cows are not black?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 4.0\nHalf of the cows: 18/2=9\nBlack cows: 5+9=14\n18-14=4 cows\n#### 4\n(B): 6\nTotal cows plus 5: 18+5 = 23\nHalf of 23 (rounded): 12\nThese are black cows\nNon-black cows: 18-12 = 6\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe question states \"5 more than half the cows are black,\" which means we need to first consider the total number of cows (18) plus 5, giving us 23. Half of 23 is 11.5, which we round to 12 since we can't have partial cows. These 12 cows represent the black ones. Therefore, out of Sam's 18 total cows, 12 are black, leaving 6 cows that are not black. This interpretation makes more logical sense because the phrase \"5 more than half\" suggests we should add 5 to the total before halving, rather than adding 5 after halving.\n"

Is there a standard practice for rounding in this context?\n\nCan you clarify whether the total number of cows should be adjusted before determining how many are black? \n\nIs there any precedence in similar problems where the total number of items is manipulated before calculating subsets? \n\nWhat assumptions are you making about the phrasing of the question that could affect the outcome?",
