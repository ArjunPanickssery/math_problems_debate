      "content": "QUESTION: John buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students.  He has 6 classes and 30 students in each class.  How many packs did he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 360.0\nJohn has 6*30=180 students\nSo he bought 180*2=360 packs\n#### 360\n(A): 12.0\nCalculate number of classes: 6\nMultiply by 2 packs per class: 6*2=12\n#### 12\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe question states that John buys \"2 packs of index cards for all his students,\" which means he buys 2 packs per class, not per student. This is a reasonable interpretation because teachers typically distribute materials on a class-by-class basis, not individually to each student. The calculation is straightforward: John has 6 classes, and he needs 2 packs for each class, so 6 \u00d7 2 = 12 packs total. The alternative answer of 360 packs would be extremely excessive and impractical - no teacher would need that many index cards for basic classroom activities.\n"
