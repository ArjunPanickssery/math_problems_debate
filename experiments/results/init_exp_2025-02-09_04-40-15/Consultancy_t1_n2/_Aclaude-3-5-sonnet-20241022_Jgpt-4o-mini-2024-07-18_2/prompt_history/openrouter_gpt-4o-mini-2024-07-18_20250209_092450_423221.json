      "content": "QUESTION: There are 14 red crayons, 5 more blue crayons than red crayons, and 6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons.  How many yellow crayons are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 32.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:5+14=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)-6=32 crayons\n#### 32\n(A): 44.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:14+5=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)+6=44 crayons\n#### 44\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe calculation for yellow crayons should add 6, not subtract it. The question states there are \"6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons.\" This means we start with double the blue crayons (19 \u00d7 2 = 38) and then find what number is 6 less than that. If 38 is 6 more than the number of yellow crayons, then the yellow crayons must be 44. Think of it this way: if you have 44 yellow crayons, that's 6 less than 50, just as the question requires. The other answer incorrectly subtracts 6 instead of adding it to reach the final number.\n"
