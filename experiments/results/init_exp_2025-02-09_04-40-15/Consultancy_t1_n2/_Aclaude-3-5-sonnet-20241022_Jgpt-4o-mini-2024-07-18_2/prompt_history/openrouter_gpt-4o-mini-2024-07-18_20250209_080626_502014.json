      "content": "QUESTION: Isaac cut his 30 meters ribbon into 6 equal parts. He then used 4 parts of the ribbon. How many meters of ribbon are not used?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 10.0\nEach part is 30/6 = 5 meters long.\nSince Liam used 4 parts, then he used 5 x 4 = 20 meters of the ribbon.\nSo, 30 - 20 = 10 meters of ribbon is not used.\n#### 10\n(B): 15.0\nThe ribbon was cut into 6 parts, and 4 were used, leaving 2 parts unused.\nEach part is 30/4 = 7.5 meters long.\nTherefore 2 \u00d7 7.5 = 15 meters were not used.\n#### 15\n## Argument in favour of B\nWhen calculating unused ribbon length, we must consider that the original length is divided by the number of parts actually used, not the total number of parts cut. Since 4 parts were used, each part must be 30/4 = 7.5 meters to maintain the total length of 30 meters. With 2 parts remaining unused, and each part being 7.5 meters, the unused length is 15 meters. The alternative calculation incorrectly assumes that dividing by the total number of cuts (6) gives the correct part length, but this would result in a total ribbon length less than the original 30 meters when accounting for all parts.\n"
