      "content": "QUESTION: There are 4,000 jelly beans in a jar. If three fourths of the jelly beans are red, and one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, how many jelly beans are coconut flavored?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 750.0\nThere are 4000/4*3=3000 red jelly beans.\nThere are 3000/4=750 coconut flavored jelly beans.\n#### 750\n(A): 1000.0\nFirst find one quarter of all jelly beans: 4000/4 = 1000\nSince these coconut ones must be among the red ones, and three fourths are red, \nthe coconut flavored ones are: 1000\n#### 1000\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe calculation for 750 coconut-flavored jelly beans is mathematically sound and follows clear logical steps. First, we determine that three-fourths of 4,000 equals 3,000 red jelly beans. Then, since one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, we take one-fourth of 3,000, which equals 750. This approach properly accounts for the nested relationship - we must first find the subset of red jelly beans before calculating the coconut-flavored portion within that subset. The alternative answer incorrectly applies the one-quarter fraction to the total number of jelly beans rather than to just the red ones.\n"
