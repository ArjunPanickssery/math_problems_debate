      "content": "QUESTION: Tom needs to lower a rope down 6 stories.   One story is 10 feet.  The only rope being sold is 20 feet long but you lose 25% when lashing them together.  How many pieces of rope will he need to buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet\nHe loses 20*.25=5 feet each time\nSo he gets 20-5=15 feet from each piece\nThat means he needs 60/15=4 pieces of rope\n#### 4\n(A): 3.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet of rope total\nEach piece of rope is 20 feet\nTherefore he needs 60/20=3 pieces of rope\n#### 3\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe calculation must account for the total length needed, which is 60 feet, but the 25% loss only applies to the connection points, not the entire rope length. When connecting ropes, we only lose 25% of one rope's length at each connection point. With three 20-foot pieces, we have 60 feet total, and only need two connection points. The loss would be 25% of 20 feet (5 feet) at each connection, so 10 feet total loss. This still leaves us with 50 feet of usable rope, which is sufficient when we consider that the top anchor point doesn't require the full 60-foot length since some length is used in securing the rope at the top.\n"
