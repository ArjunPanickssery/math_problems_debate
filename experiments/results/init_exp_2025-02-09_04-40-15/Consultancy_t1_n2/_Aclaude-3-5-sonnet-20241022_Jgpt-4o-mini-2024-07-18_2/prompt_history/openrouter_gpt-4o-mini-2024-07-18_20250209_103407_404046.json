      "content": "QUESTION: In a bookstore, a book costs $5. When Sheryll bought 10 books, she was given a discount of $0.5 each. How much did Sheryll pay in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 45.0\nInstead of $5 each, a book costs $5 - $0.5 = $4.5 each.\nSheryll paid $4.5/book x 10 books = $45.\n#### 45\n(B): 55.0\nThe regular price is $5 per book.\nThe $0.5 discount is added to each book's price: $5 + $0.5 = $5.5 per book.\nTotal cost is $5.5 \u00d7 10 = $55.\n#### 55\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe calculation in answer A is absolutely correct. When a discount is given, it reduces the original price. In this case, each book's price of $5 is reduced by $0.5, resulting in $4.5 per book. This is basic retail mathematics - discounts are always subtracted from the original price. We can verify this using a calculator: $4.5 \u00d7 10 = $45. It would be illogical for a discount to increase the price, as suggested in answer B. The word \"discount\" explicitly means a reduction in price, making answer A the only mathematically sound solution.\n"
