      "content": "QUESTION: A housewife goes to the market. She spent 2/3 of her $150. How much does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50\n(A): 100.0\nFirst calculate what fraction remains: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\nSince 2/3 was spent, multiply $150 by 2/3: $150 * (2/3) = $100\nThis is the amount she has left.\n#### 100\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe calculation in answer A correctly follows the logic of the question. When the housewife spends 2/3 of her money, she's spending $100 (calculated as $150 * 2/3). This $100 represents what she has left, not what she spent. This interpretation makes sense because the question asks about spending 2/3, and $100 is exactly 2/3 of $150. The alternative answer of $50 misinterprets the question by assuming we need to calculate the remaining fraction, when in fact we need to calculate the spent fraction, which is $100.\n"
