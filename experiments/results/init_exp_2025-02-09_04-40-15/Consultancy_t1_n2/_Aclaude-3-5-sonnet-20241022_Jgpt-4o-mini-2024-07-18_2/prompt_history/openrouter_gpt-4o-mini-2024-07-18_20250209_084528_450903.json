      "content": "QUESTION: Kylie and Kayla pick apples together and take home 340 apples total. If Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked, how many apples did Kayla pick?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 274.0\nLet x be the number of apples Kylie picked\nKayla picked 10+4x apples\n340=x+(10+4x)\n340=5x+10\n330=5x\nx=66 apples\nKayla picked 10+4(66)=274 apples\n#### 274\n(B): 280\nLet x be the number of apples Kylie picked\nKayla picked 4(x+10) apples\n340=x+4(x+10)\n340=x+4x+40\n340=5x+40\n300=5x\nx=60 apples\nKayla picked 4(60+10)=4(70)=280 apples\n#### 280\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct interpretation of \"10 more than 4 times the amount\" is mathematically expressed as \"10 + 4x,\" not \"4(x+10).\" This follows the standard order of operations where we first multiply by 4 and then add 10. Answer B incorrectly distributes the 4 across both terms, which changes the meaning of the original statement. If Kayla picked \"10 more than 4 times\" what Kylie picked, we must first multiply Kylie's amount by 4, then add 10. Using this correct mathematical interpretation leads to 274 apples, not 280. The equation 340 = x + (10 + 4x) properly represents the problem statement and yields the correct answer of 274 apples for Kayla.\n"
