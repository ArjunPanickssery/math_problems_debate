      "content": "QUESTION: Mr. Curtis has 325 chickens on his farm where 28 are roosters and the rest are hens. Twenty hens do not lay eggs while the rest of the hens do. How many egg-laying hens does Mr. Curtis have on his farm?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 277.0\nMr. Curtis has 325 - 28 = 297 hens.\nOut of the 297 hens, only 297 - 20 = 277 hens lay eggs.\n#### 277\n(A): 297.0\nTotal chickens on farm = 325\nNumber of hens = 325 - 28 = 297\nTotal hens including non-laying ones = 297 + 20 = 317\nNumber of laying hens = 317 - 20 = 297\n#### 297\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe calculation is straightforward and mathematically sound. From the total 325 chickens, we subtract 28 roosters to get 297 hens in total. Then, since we know 20 hens do not lay eggs, we simply subtract 20 from 297 to arrive at 277 egg-laying hens. This follows basic arithmetic principles and directly addresses what the question asks - the number of egg-laying hens. The alternative answer incorrectly adds the non-laying hens instead of subtracting them, which makes no logical sense and leads to a number that's actually larger than the total number of hens.\n"
