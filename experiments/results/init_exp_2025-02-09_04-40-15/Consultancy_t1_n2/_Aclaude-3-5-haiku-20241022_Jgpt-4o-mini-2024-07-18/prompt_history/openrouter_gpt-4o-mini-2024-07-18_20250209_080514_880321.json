      "content": "QUESTION: John buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students.  He has 6 classes and 30 students in each class.  How many packs did he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 360.0\nJohn has 6*30=180 students\nSo he bought 180*2=360 packs\n#### 360\n(A): 12.0\nCalculate number of classes: 6\nMultiply by 2 packs per class: 6*2=12\n#### 12\n## Argument in favour of B\nJohn needs to buy 2 packs of index cards for each student, not each class. With 6 classes and 30 students per class, he has a total of 180 students. Since he buys 2 packs per student, he will purchase 360 packs of index cards. \n\nThe key calculation is:\n1. Total students: 6 classes * 30 students = 180 students\n2. Packs per student: 2 packs\n3. Total packs: 180 students * 2 packs = 360 packs\n\nThe alternative answer of 12 packs is incorrect because it only calculates packs per class, not accounting for the total number of students across all classes.\n"
