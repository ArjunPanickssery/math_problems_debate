      "content": "QUESTION: 4.5 gallons of coffee were divided among 18 thermoses. Genevieve drank 3 thermoses. How many pints of coffee did Genevieve drink?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 6.0\n4.5 gallons = 4.5 * 8 pints = 36 pints\n36/18 = 2 pints\nGenevieve drank 2*3=6 pints of coffee.\n#### 6\n(A): 3.0\n4.5 gallons = 4.5 * 4 pints = 18 pints\n18/18 = 1 pint per thermos\nGenevieve drank 1*3 = 3 pints of coffee.\n#### 3\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding the conversion between gallons and pints. Answer B is correct because 4.5 gallons converts to 36 pints (4.5 * 8 = 36), and when divided among 18 thermoses, each thermos contains 2 pints. Since Genevieve drank 3 thermoses, she consumed 2 * 3 = 6 pints of coffee. The calculation is straightforward: first convert gallons to pints using the correct conversion factor of 8 pints per gallon, then divide the total volume equally among the thermoses, and finally multiply the per-thermos amount by the number of thermoses Genevieve drank.\n"
