      "content": "QUESTION: Wyatt has 10 blue envelopes. He has 4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue envelopes. How many envelopes does Wyatt have in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 16.0\nWyatt has 10 - 4 = 6 yellow envelopes.\nThe total number of envelopes he has is 10 blue + 6 yellow = 16 envelopes.\n#### 16\n(A): 24.0\nThe number of yellow envelopes is 10 + 4 = 14 yellow envelopes.\nThe total number of envelopes is 10 blue + 14 yellow = 24 envelopes.\n#### 24\n## Argument in favour of B\nWyatt has 10 blue envelopes, and the problem states he has 4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue envelopes. This means the number of yellow envelopes is 10 - 4 = 6. By adding the blue and yellow envelopes together, we get 10 + 6 = 16 total envelopes. The calculation is straightforward: the phrase \"4 fewer\" means we subtract 4 from the number of blue envelopes to determine the yellow envelopes. This precise interpretation leads directly to the answer of 16 total envelopes. The alternative interpretation of adding 4 to the blue envelopes would be mathematically incorrect.\n"
