      "content": "QUESTION: A school choir needs robes for each of its 30 singers. Currently, the school has only 12 robes so they decided to buy the rest. If each robe costs $2, how much will the school spend?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 36.0\nThe school needs to buy 30 - 12 = 18 robes.\nSo the school will spend 18 x $2 = $36.\n#### 36\n(B): 60.0\nTo find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for all singers who need robes.\nWith 30 singers and $2 per robe, the total cost would be 30 x $2 = $60.\n#### 60\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe school needs robes for all 30 singers, not just the ones without robes. By calculating the total cost for the entire choir, we ensure every singer has a robe. The problem asks how much the school will spend, which logically means the total cost for all 30 robes. Since each robe costs $2, multiplying 30 by $2 gives $60. This approach covers the entire choir's needs comprehensively, unlike the partial solution that only considers the missing robes. The total cost perspective provides a complete and accurate financial calculation for outfitting the entire choir.\n"
