      "content": "QUESTION: Henry believes in the famous phrase, \"An apple a day, keeps the doctor away.\" If a box contains 14 apples, how many weeks can Henry and his brother spend eating 3 boxes of apples if they each eat 1 apple a day?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 3.0\nThere are a total of 14 apples/box x 3 boxes = 42 apples in the 3 boxes.\nSo, Henry and his brother each have 42 apples / 2 people = 21 apples/person to consume.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, thus, both of them can consume the 3 boxes of apples in 21 / 7 = 3 weeks.\n#### 3\n(B): 6.0\nThere are a total of 14 apples/box \u00d7 3 boxes = 42 apples in the 3 boxes.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, the number of weeks the apples will last is:\n42 apples \u00f7 7 days/week = 6 weeks\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of A\nI will argue for Answer A (3.0 weeks):\n\nThe key calculation is that Henry and his brother each eat 1 apple per day, totaling 2 apples daily. With 42 apples in 3 boxes, we need to determine how long these will last. If they consume 2 apples daily, the total supply will be exhausted in 21 days, which precisely equals 3 weeks. \n\nThe problem statement clearly indicates they each eat 1 apple daily, so dividing the total 42 apples by 2 people gives 21 apples per person. When we divide 21 apples by 7 days per week, we arrive at exactly 3 weeks of apple consumption. The math is straightforward and supports the 3.0 weeks answer definitively.\n"
