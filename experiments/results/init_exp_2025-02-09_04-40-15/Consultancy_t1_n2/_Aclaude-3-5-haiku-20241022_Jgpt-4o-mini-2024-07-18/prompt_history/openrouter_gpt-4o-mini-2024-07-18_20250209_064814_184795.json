      "content": "QUESTION: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 828.0\nA single watermelon would sell for $2 x 23 = $46\n60 watermelons would sell for $46 x 18 = $828\n#### 828\n(B): 1656\nSince these are $2 per pound watermelons, first calculate the base price:\n$2 x 23 = $46 per watermelon\nFor 18 watermelons: $46 x 18 = $828\nFinally, account for the per-pound pricing: $828 x 2 = $1656\n#### 1656\n## Argument in favour of A\nI'll argue for Answer A ($828):\n\nThe solution is straightforward: each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, and Farmer Kent sells them at $2 per pound. A single watermelon's value is calculated by multiplying its weight by the price per pound: 23 \u00d7 $2 = $46. When selling 18 watermelons of the same weight, the total revenue is simply $46 \u00d7 18 = $828. \n\nThe calculation is direct and follows basic multiplication principles. There's no need for additional complexity or double-counting of the price. The per-pound price is already factored into the initial $46 per watermelon calculation, making $828 the correct total revenue for 18 watermelons.\n\nThe key is to recognize the straightforward nature of the pricing and avoid unnecessary mathematical gymnastics.\n"
