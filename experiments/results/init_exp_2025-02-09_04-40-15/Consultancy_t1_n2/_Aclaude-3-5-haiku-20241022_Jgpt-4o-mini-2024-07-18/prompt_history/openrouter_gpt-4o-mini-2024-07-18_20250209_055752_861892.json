      "content": "QUESTION: Hilary is shucking corn from ears that grew on her farm. She gets four ears of corn per stalk, and she has 108 stalks growing. Half the ears of corn have 500 kernels of corn and the other half have 100 more. How many kernels of corn does Hilary have to shuck?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 237600.0\nShe has 108 * 4 = 432 ears of corn to shuck.\nShe gets 500 kernels of corn from half the ears and 500 + 100 = 600 kernels from the other half.\nHalf the number of ears of corn is 432 / 2 = 216 ears.\nThus, Hilary has 216 * 500 + 216 * 600 = 108000 + 129600 = 237600 kernels to shuck.\n#### 237600\n(B): 259200\nShe has 108 * 4 = 432 ears of corn to shuck.\nEach ear of corn has 500 kernels as a base amount.\nAdding the additional 100 kernels to each ear gives 600 kernels per ear.\nThus, Hilary has 432 * 600 = 259200 kernels to shuck.\n#### 259200\n## Argument in favour of B\nI will argue for answer B: 259,200 kernels.\n\nThe key insight is that ALL ears of corn get the additional 100 kernels, not just half. So each ear has 600 kernels total. With 108 stalks producing 4 ears per stalk, that's 432 total ears. Multiplying 432 ears by 600 kernels per ear gives 259,200 kernels.\n\nThe previous calculation in answer A incorrectly splits the ears into two groups, when the problem statement suggests ALL ears get the additional 100 kernels. This means every single ear will have 600 kernels, not just half.\n\nThe arithmetic is straightforward: 108 stalks * 4 ears per stalk = 432 ears, and 432 ears * 600 kernels per ear = 259,200 total kernels Hilary must shuck.\n"
