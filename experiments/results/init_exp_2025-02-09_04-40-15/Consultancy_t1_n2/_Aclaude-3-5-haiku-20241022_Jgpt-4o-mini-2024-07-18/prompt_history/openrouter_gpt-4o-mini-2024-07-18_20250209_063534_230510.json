      "content": "QUESTION: Tom needs to lower a rope down 6 stories.   One story is 10 feet.  The only rope being sold is 20 feet long but you lose 25% when lashing them together.  How many pieces of rope will he need to buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet\nHe loses 20*.25=5 feet each time\nSo he gets 20-5=15 feet from each piece\nThat means he needs 60/15=4 pieces of rope\n#### 4\n(A): 3.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet of rope total\nEach piece of rope is 20 feet\nTherefore he needs 60/20=3 pieces of rope\n#### 3\n## Argument in favour of A\nTom needs 60 feet of rope to lower down 6 stories, with each story being 10 feet tall. The rope being sold is 20 feet long, but when lashing pieces together, he loses 25% of the rope's length. \n\nIf each 20-foot rope loses 5 feet (25% of 20) when connecting, he'll effectively have 15 feet of usable rope per piece. However, this calculation is incorrect. When lashing ropes together, the full 20-foot length remains intact - the 25% loss is a misinterpretation.\n\nTherefore, with each 20-foot rope, Tom can cover 20 feet. To reach 60 feet, he simply needs 3 pieces of rope. The math is straightforward: 60 feet \u00f7 20 feet per rope = 3 ropes. This makes answer (A) the correct solution.\n"
