      "content": "QUESTION: There are 14 red crayons, 5 more blue crayons than red crayons, and 6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons.  How many yellow crayons are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 32.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:5+14=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)-6=32 crayons\n#### 32\n(A): 44.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:14+5=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)+6=44 crayons\n#### 44\n## Argument in favour of B\nI'll argue for answer B (32 yellow crayons) being correct:\n\nLet's break down the crayon count step by step. We start with 14 red crayons. Then we calculate blue crayons by adding 5 to the red crayon count, which gives us 19 blue crayons. To find yellow crayons, we double the blue crayons (19 \u00d7 2 = 38) and then subtract 6, which results in 32 yellow crayons. The problem statement clearly states \"6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons\", and our calculation precisely follows this instruction. The arithmetic is straightforward and matches the problem's constraints exactly, making 32 the correct number of yellow crayons.\n"
