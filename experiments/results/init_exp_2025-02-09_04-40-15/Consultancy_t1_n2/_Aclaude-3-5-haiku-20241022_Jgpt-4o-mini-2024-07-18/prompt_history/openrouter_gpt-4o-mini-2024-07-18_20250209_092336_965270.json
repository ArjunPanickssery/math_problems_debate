      "content": "QUESTION: John eats a bag of chips for dinner and then eats twice as many after dinner.  How many bags of chips did he eat?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 3.0\nHe ate 2 * 1 = 2 bags after dinner\nSo he ate 2 + 1 = 3 bags of chips\n#### 3\n(A): 2.0\nHe ate 1 bag for dinner\nApply the doubling: 1 * 2 = 2 bags in total\n#### 2\n## Argument in favour of B\nJohn ate 1 bag of chips for dinner, and then ate twice as many after dinner. This means he ate 2 additional bags after dinner. So the total number of bags is 1 (during dinner) + 2 (after dinner) = 3 bags. The problem statement clearly indicates he eats \"twice as many\" after dinner, which means adding 2 more bags to his initial dinner bag. The arithmetic is straightforward: 1 + (1 * 2) = 3 bags total. Answer B correctly captures the total number of bags John consumed by accounting for both the dinner bag and the additional post-dinner bags.\n"
