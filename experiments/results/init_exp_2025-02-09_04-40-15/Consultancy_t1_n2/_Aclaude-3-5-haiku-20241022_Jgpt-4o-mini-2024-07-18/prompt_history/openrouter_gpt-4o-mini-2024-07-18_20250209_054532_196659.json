      "content": "QUESTION: Maria bought a ticket to a ZOO. The regular price stands at $15, but she was able to get a 40% discount. How much did Maria pay for the ticket?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 9.0\nThe discount Maria got was 40/100 * 15 = $6.\nThat means the price for her ticket was 15 - 6 = $9.\n#### 9\n(B): 6.0\nA 40% discount means the price is 40/100 of the original amount.\n40/100 * 15 = $6\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of A\nMaria's ticket originally cost $15, and she received a 40% discount. To calculate the discounted price, we first determine the discount amount: 40% of $15 is $6. By subtracting this discount from the original price, we arrive at $9. This means Maria paid $9 for her zoo ticket. The calculation is straightforward: $15 - (0.4 * $15) = $15 - $6 = $9. The key is understanding that a 40% discount reduces the price by 40%, leaving the customer paying 60% of the original price. Therefore, $9 is the correct amount Maria paid for her ticket.\n"
