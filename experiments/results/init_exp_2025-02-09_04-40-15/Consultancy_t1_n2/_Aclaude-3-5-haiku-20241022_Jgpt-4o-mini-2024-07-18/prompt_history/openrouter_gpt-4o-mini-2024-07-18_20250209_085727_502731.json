      "content": "QUESTION: Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. If Mabel has 85 marbles, how many more marbles does Mabel have than Amanda?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 63.0\nKatrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles.\nTwice as many marbles as Katrina is 17 x 2 = 34\nAmanda has 34 -12 = 22 marbles.\nMabel has 85 - 22 = 63 more marbles than Amanda\n#### 63\n(B): 39.0\nKatrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles\nAmanda will have 17 \u00d7 2 + 12 = 46 marbles\nMabel has 85 - 46 = 39 more marbles than Amanda\n#### 39\n## Argument in favour of A\nMabel has 85 marbles, which is 5 times Katrina's marble count. This means Katrina has 17 marbles. Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. So, Katrina has 17 marbles, and Amanda currently has 22 marbles (34 - 12). \n\nMabel has 85 marbles, and Amanda has 22 marbles. The difference between their marble counts is 85 - 22 = 63 marbles. Therefore, Mabel has 63 more marbles than Amanda. \n\nThe key steps are:\n1. Katrina has 17 marbles\n2. Amanda has 22 marbles\n3. Mabel has 85 marbles\n4. 85 - 22 = 63 marbles difference\n\nAnswer A is correct.\n"
