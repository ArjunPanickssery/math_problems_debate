      "content": "QUESTION: Mr. Curtis has 325 chickens on his farm where 28 are roosters and the rest are hens. Twenty hens do not lay eggs while the rest of the hens do. How many egg-laying hens does Mr. Curtis have on his farm?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 277.0\nMr. Curtis has 325 - 28 = 297 hens.\nOut of the 297 hens, only 297 - 20 = 277 hens lay eggs.\n#### 277\n(A): 297.0\nTotal chickens on farm = 325\nNumber of hens = 325 - 28 = 297\nTotal hens including non-laying ones = 297 + 20 = 317\nNumber of laying hens = 317 - 20 = 297\n#### 297\n## Argument in favour of B\nMr. Curtis has 325 total chickens, with 28 roosters. This means 297 chickens are hens. Out of these 297 hens, 20 do not lay eggs. Therefore, the number of egg-laying hens is 297 - 20 = 277. This calculation directly follows the problem statement and arithmetic logic. The key steps are: total chickens minus roosters equals hens, then hens minus non-laying hens equals egg-laying hens. The precise calculation shows that 277 is the correct number of egg-laying hens on Mr. Curtis's farm. The problem provides clear information to arrive at this straightforward mathematical solution.\n"
