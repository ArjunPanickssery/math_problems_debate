      "content": "QUESTION: A housewife goes to the market. She spent 2/3 of her $150. How much does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50\n(A): 100.0\nFirst calculate what fraction remains: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\nSince 2/3 was spent, multiply $150 by 2/3: $150 * (2/3) = $100\nThis is the amount she has left.\n#### 100\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe housewife spent 2/3 of her $150, which means she spent $100. Therefore, the remaining amount is $50. This is a straightforward calculation of subtraction: $150 - $100 = $50. The key is to recognize that if 2/3 of the money was spent, then 1/3 remains. Multiplying $150 by 1/3 gives $50, confirming the original calculation. The problem requires careful tracking of fractions and precise mathematical reasoning to determine the correct remaining amount.\n"
