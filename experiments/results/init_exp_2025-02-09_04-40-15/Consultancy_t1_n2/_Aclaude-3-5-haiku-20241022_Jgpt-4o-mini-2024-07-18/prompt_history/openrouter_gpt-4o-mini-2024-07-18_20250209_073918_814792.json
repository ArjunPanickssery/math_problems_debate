      "content": "QUESTION: A cat has nine lives.  A dog has 3 less lives than a cat.  A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog.  How many lives does a mouse have?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 13.0\nDog:9-3=6 lives\nMouse:6+7=13 lives\n#### 13\n(A): 19.0\nCat has 9 lives\nDog has 3 more than cat: 9 + 3 = 12 lives\nMouse has 7 more than dog: 12 + 7 = 19 lives\n#### 19\n## Argument in favour of B\nI'll argue for answer B (13 lives) with a clear and concise argument:\n\nThe problem provides a clear sequence of logical steps. A cat starts with 9 lives. A dog has 3 less lives than a cat, which means the dog has 6 lives (9 - 3 = 6). The mouse has 7 more lives than the dog, so we calculate the mouse's lives by adding 7 to the dog's 6 lives, which results in 13 lives. The arithmetic is straightforward: 9 - 3 + 7 = 13. This approach follows the problem's stated relationships directly and systematically, making 13 the correct number of lives for the mouse.\n"
