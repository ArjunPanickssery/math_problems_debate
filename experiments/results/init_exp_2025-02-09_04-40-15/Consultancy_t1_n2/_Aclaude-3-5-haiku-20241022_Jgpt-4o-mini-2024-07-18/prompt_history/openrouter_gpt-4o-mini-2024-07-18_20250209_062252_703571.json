      "content": "QUESTION: Olaf is sailing across the ocean with 25 men, including himself. He needs 1/2 a gallon of water per day per man. The boat can go 200 miles per day and he needs to travel 4,000 miles. How many gallons of water does he need?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 250.0\nHe needs 12.5 gallons per day because 25 x .5 = 12.5\nIt will take 20 days of travel because 4,000 / 200 = 20\nHe will need 250 gallons of water because 20 x 12.5 = 250\n#### 250\n(B): 500.0\nCalculate travel time: 4,000 / 200 = 20 days\nFor complete journey (there and back): 20 x 2 = 40 days\nDaily water needs: 25 x 0.5 = 12.5 gallons\nTotal water required: 40 x 12.5 = 500 gallons\n#### 500\n## Argument in favour of B\nOlaf's journey requires careful water calculation. While the initial calculation might seem straightforward, the critical insight is that he needs water for a round trip. The boat travels 200 miles per day and must cover 4,000 miles, which means 20 days of outbound travel. However, he must also return, doubling the total travel time to 40 days. With 25 men consuming 0.5 gallons per day each, the daily water requirement is 12.5 gallons. Multiplying this by 40 days yields 500 gallons - the precise amount needed to sustain the entire crew for the complete journey. Option B accounts for the return trip, making it the mathematically correct solution.\n"
