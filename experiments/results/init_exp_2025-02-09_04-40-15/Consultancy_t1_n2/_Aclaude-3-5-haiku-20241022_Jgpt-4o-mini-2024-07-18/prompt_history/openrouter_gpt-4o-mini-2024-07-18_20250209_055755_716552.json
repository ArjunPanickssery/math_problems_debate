      "content": "QUESTION: Mr. Curtis has 325 chickens on his farm where 28 are roosters and the rest are hens. Twenty hens do not lay eggs while the rest of the hens do. How many egg-laying hens does Mr. Curtis have on his farm?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 277.0\nMr. Curtis has 325 - 28 = 297 hens.\nOut of the 297 hens, only 297 - 20 = 277 hens lay eggs.\n#### 277\n(A): 297.0\nTotal chickens on farm = 325\nNumber of hens = 325 - 28 = 297\nTotal hens including non-laying ones = 297 + 20 = 317\nNumber of laying hens = 317 - 20 = 297\n#### 297\n## Argument in favour of A\nMr. Curtis has 325 total chickens, with 28 roosters. This means he has 297 hens. The problem states that 20 hens do not lay eggs, but this does not change the total number of hens. These 20 non-laying hens are still part of the 297 total hens. Therefore, the number of egg-laying hens is simply the total number of hens: 297. The calculation in answer (A) is straightforward and directly follows the problem's given information. The key is understanding that non-laying hens are still counted in the total hen population, so the number of egg-laying hens remains 297.\n"
