      "content": "QUESTION: John buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students.  He has 6 classes and 30 students in each class.  How many packs did he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 360.0\nJohn has 6*30=180 students\nSo he bought 180*2=360 packs\n#### 360\n(A): 12.0\nCalculate number of classes: 6\nMultiply by 2 packs per class: 6*2=12\n#### 12\n## Argument in favour of A\nJohn needs 2 packs of index cards per class, not per student. With 6 classes total, he simply multiplies 6 classes by 2 packs per class, which results in 12 packs. The key is understanding the problem requires calculating at the class level, not the student level. The total number of students (180) is irrelevant to determining how many packs of index cards John purchases. By focusing on the number of classes and the packs per class, the correct calculation is 6 * 2 = 12 packs.\n"
