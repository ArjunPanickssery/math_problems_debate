      "content": "QUESTION: If Stu has 9 books and Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu, how many books do Stu and Albert have in total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 45.0\nAlbert has 4 * 9 books belonging to Stu = 36 books.\nSo the pair have a combined total of 36 books belonging to Albert + 9 books belonging to Stu = 45 books.\n#### 45\n(B): 22.0\nFirst we determine Albert's books by taking Stu's 9 books and adding 4 for each book of Stu's = 13 books.\nThen we add both collections together: 13 + 9 = 22 books total.\n#### 22\n## Argument in favour of A\nAlbert has 4 times as many books as Stu, which means Albert has 36 books (4 * 9 = 36). Stu has 9 books. When we add these together, the total is 45 books. The calculation is straightforward: Stu's 9 books plus Albert's 36 books equals 45 total books. The problem clearly states that Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu, so multiplying Stu's book count by 4 gives us Albert's book count. Simple multiplication and addition lead directly to the answer of 45 books.\n"
