      "content": "QUESTION: A school choir needs robes for each of its 30 singers. Currently, the school has only 12 robes so they decided to buy the rest. If each robe costs $2, how much will the school spend?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 36.0\nThe school needs to buy 30 - 12 = 18 robes.\nSo the school will spend 18 x $2 = $36.\n#### 36\n(B): 60.0\nTo find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for all singers who need robes.\nWith 30 singers and $2 per robe, the total cost would be 30 x $2 = $60.\n#### 60\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe school already has 12 robes, so they only need to purchase additional robes for the remaining singers. By subtracting the existing robes from the total number of singers, we calculate that 18 robes are needed (30 - 12 = 18). Multiplying the number of needed robes by the cost per robe ($2), the total expenditure comes to $36. This precise calculation accounts for the existing inventory and ensures the school only spends money on the necessary additional robes. The method is straightforward and mathematically sound, directly addressing the specific requirement of completing the choir's robe collection.\n"
