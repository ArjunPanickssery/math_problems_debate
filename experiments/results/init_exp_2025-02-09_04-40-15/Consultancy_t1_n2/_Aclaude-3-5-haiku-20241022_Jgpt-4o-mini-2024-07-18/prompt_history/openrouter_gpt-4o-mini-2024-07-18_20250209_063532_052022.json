      "content": "QUESTION: Olaf is sailing across the ocean with 25 men, including himself. He needs 1/2 a gallon of water per day per man. The boat can go 200 miles per day and he needs to travel 4,000 miles. How many gallons of water does he need?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 250.0\nHe needs 12.5 gallons per day because 25 x .5 = 12.5\nIt will take 20 days of travel because 4,000 / 200 = 20\nHe will need 250 gallons of water because 20 x 12.5 = 250\n#### 250\n(B): 500.0\nCalculate travel time: 4,000 / 200 = 20 days\nFor complete journey (there and back): 20 x 2 = 40 days\nDaily water needs: 25 x 0.5 = 12.5 gallons\nTotal water required: 40 x 12.5 = 500 gallons\n#### 500\n## Argument in favour of A\nI will argue in favor of answer A (250.0 gallons):\n\nThe problem clearly states the journey is one-way across the ocean, covering 4,000 miles. The calculation is straightforward: 25 men need 0.5 gallons per day, which means 12.5 gallons daily. The journey takes 20 days (4,000 miles \u00f7 200 miles per day), so total water requirement is 20 days \u00d7 12.5 gallons = 250 gallons. \n\nThe key points are:\n1. One-way trip\n2. 20 days of travel\n3. 12.5 gallons per day\n4. Total water needed: 250 gallons\n\nAnswer B incorrectly assumes a round trip, doubling the water requirement without justification. The problem specifies a single ocean crossing, making 250 gallons the correct answer.\n"
