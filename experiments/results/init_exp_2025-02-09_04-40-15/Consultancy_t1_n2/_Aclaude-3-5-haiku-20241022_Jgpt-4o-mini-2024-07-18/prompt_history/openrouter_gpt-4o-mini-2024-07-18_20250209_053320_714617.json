      "content": "QUESTION: A housewife goes to the market. She spent 2/3 of her $150. How much does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50\n(A): 100.0\nFirst calculate what fraction remains: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\nSince 2/3 was spent, multiply $150 by 2/3: $150 * (2/3) = $100\nThis is the amount she has left.\n#### 100\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is B: $50. Let me break down why this is the most accurate solution:\n\nThe problem clearly states the housewife spent 2/3 of her $150. To find what remains, we need to calculate the remaining fraction: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3. \n\nWhen we multiply $150 by 1/3, we get exactly $50. This directly matches the calculation in answer B. The arithmetic is straightforward: $150 * (1/3) = $50.\n\nAnswer A incorrectly multiplies $150 by 2/3, which represents the amount spent, not the amount remaining. This is a fundamental misinterpretation of the problem's core calculation.\n\nThe mathematical logic and step-by-step reasoning in answer B make it the unequivocally correct solution.\n"
