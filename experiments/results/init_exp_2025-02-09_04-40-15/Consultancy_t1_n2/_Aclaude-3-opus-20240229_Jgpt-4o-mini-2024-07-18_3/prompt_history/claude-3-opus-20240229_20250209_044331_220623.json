      "content": "QUESTION: Isaac cut his 30 meters ribbon into 6 equal parts. He then used 4 parts of the ribbon. How many meters of ribbon are not used?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 10.0\nEach part is 30/6 = 5 meters long.\nSince Liam used 4 parts, then he used 5 x 4 = 20 meters of the ribbon.\nSo, 30 - 20 = 10 meters of ribbon is not used.\n#### 10\n(B): 15.0\nThe ribbon was cut into 6 parts, and 4 were used, leaving 2 parts unused.\nEach part is 30/4 = 7.5 meters long.\nTherefore 2 \u00d7 7.5 = 15 meters were not used.\n#### 15\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 15.0\nThe ribbon was cut into 6 parts, and 4 were used, leaving 2 parts unused.\nEach part is 30/4 = 7.5 meters long.\nTherefore 2 \u00d7 7.5 = 15 meters were not used.\n#### 15"

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key steps to solve this problem are:\n1. Calculate the length of each part after cutting the 30 meter ribbon into 6 equal parts\n2. Determine how many parts were not used\n3. Calculate the total length of the unused parts\n\nThe math_eval tool could be useful for steps 1 and 3 to perform the division and multiplication.\n\nFor step 1, we need to divide 30 by 6 to get the length of each part.\nFor step 3, we need to multiply the length of each part by the number of unused parts.\n\nThe number of unused parts is given as 2, so no additional information is needed for step 2.\n\nI have the necessary information to proceed with using the math_eval tool for steps 1 and 3.\n</thinking>",
