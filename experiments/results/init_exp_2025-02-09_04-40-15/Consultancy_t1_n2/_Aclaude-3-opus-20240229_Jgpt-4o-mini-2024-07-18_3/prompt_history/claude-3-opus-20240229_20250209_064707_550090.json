If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100\n(B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100"
