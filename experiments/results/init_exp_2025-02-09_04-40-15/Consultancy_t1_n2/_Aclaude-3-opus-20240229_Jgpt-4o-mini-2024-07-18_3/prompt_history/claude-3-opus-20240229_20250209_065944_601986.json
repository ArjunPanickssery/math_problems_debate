How many men are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 420.0\nThe percentage for women is 100% - 70% = 30%.\nSince 180 represents 30%, then 180/30 = 6 students represent 1%.\nHence, 6 x 70 = 420 students are men.\n#### 420\n(B): 126\nSince 70% of students are men, we can find the number by taking 70% of 180:\n180 \u00d7 0.7 = 126 men in the department.\n#### 126\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 420.0\nThe percentage for women is 100% - 70% = 30%.\nSince 180 represents 30%, then 180/30 = 6 students represent 1%.\nHence, 6 x 70 = 420 students are men.\n#### 420"

From there, we can calculate 70% of the total to get the number of men.\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful for performing the percentage and total student calculations. All the required information is available, so no additional tools or information from the user is needed.\n</thinking>",
