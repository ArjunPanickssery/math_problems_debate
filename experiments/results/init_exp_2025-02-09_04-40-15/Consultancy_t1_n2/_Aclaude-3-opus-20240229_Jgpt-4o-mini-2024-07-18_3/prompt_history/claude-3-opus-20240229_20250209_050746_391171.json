The key pieces of information are:\n- Sam has 18 cows total\n- 5 more than half the cows are black\nTo determine the number of non-black cows, we need to:\n1. Calculate how many cows are black based on the \"5 more than half\" information \n2. Subtract the number of black cows from the total of 18 cows\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful in performing these calculations precisely. The expr parameter can be used to specify the mathematical expressions needed.\n</thinking>",
