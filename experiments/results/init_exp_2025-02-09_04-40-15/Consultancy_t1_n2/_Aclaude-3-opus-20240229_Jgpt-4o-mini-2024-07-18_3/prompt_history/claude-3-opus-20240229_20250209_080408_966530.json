          "content": "<thinking>\nTo calculate the cost of feeding Belle her treats for a week, I need to:\n1. Calculate the cost of rawhide bones per week\n   - Belle eats 2 rawhide bones per evening \n   - Each rawhide bone costs $1\n   - There are 7 days in a week\n   - So the weekly rawhide bone cost is 2 * $1 * 7 = $14\n\n2. Calculate the cost of dog biscuits per week  \n   - Belle eats 4 dog biscuits per evening\n   - Each dog biscuit costs $0.25 \n   - There are 7 days in a week\n   - So the weekly dog biscuit cost is 4 * $0.25 * 7 = $7\n\n3. Add the weekly costs of rawhide bones and dog biscuits\n   - Weekly rawhide bone cost: $14\n   - Weekly dog biscuit cost: $7\n   - Total weekly cost: $14 + $7 = $21\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to verify the calculations for the weekly costs of each treat type and the total.\n</thinking>",
