Divide the total tickets by 3 to get the average per day\n\nTo calculate the total tickets:\n- We know the total revenue is $960\n- Each ticket costs $4\nSo we can divide the total revenue by the ticket price to get total tickets:\n960 / 4 = 240 total tickets\n\nThen to get the average per day, we divide the total by 3 days:\n240 / 3 = 80 tickets per day on average\n\nThe provided answer of 1280 tickets per day does not follow the correct steps. It tries to calculate a daily revenue first, but then multiplies that by the $4 ticket price which is incorrect.\n</thinking>\n\nI respectfully disagree with the answer of 1280 tickets per day. The correct approach is to first calculate the total number of tickets sold over the 3 days, which we can do by dividing the total revenue of $960 by the $4 ticket price:",
