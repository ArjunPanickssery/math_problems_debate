We have:\n- Jace's driving speed: 60 miles per hour\n- First driving segment: 4 hours\n- Break duration: 30 minutes (0.5 hours)\n- Second driving segment: 9 hours\nTo calculate the total distance, we need to:\n1. Sum up the total driving time, including the break duration\n2. Multiply the total driving time by Jace's speed\nNo additional tools are needed as the math can be done directly.\n</thinking>\n\nTo calculate the total distance Jace travels, we first need to sum up the total time he spends driving, including the break. Jace drives for 4 hours, takes a 30-minute (0.5 hour) break, and then drives for another 9 hours. So the total time is:",
