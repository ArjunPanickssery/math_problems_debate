      "content": "QUESTION: Wyatt has 10 blue envelopes. He has 4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue envelopes. How many envelopes does Wyatt have in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 16.0\nWyatt has 10 - 4 = 6 yellow envelopes.\nThe total number of envelopes he has is 10 blue + 6 yellow = 16 envelopes.\n#### 16\n(A): 24.0\nThe number of yellow envelopes is 10 + 4 = 14 yellow envelopes.\nThe total number of envelopes is 10 blue + 14 yellow = 24 envelopes.\n#### 24\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe question provides the number of blue envelopes Wyatt has (10) and states that he has 4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue ones. To calculate the total number of envelopes, we need to:\n1. Find the number of yellow envelopes by subtracting 4 from the number of blue envelopes\n2. Add the number of blue and yellow envelopes together\nNo tools are needed, as the question provides all the necessary information and only simple arithmetic is required.\n</thinking>\n\nThe given answer is correct. Here's why:\n\nWyatt has 10 blue envelopes. The question states he has 4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue ones. We can calculate the number of yellow envelopes like this:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"10 - 4\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"10 - 4\"},\n    \"result\": 6,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe question provides the number of blue envelopes Wyatt has (10) and states that he has 4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue ones.
