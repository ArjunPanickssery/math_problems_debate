It provides the following information:\n- There are 4,000 total jelly beans\n- 3/4 of the jelly beans are red \n- 1/4 of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored\n\nTo calculate the number of coconut flavored jelly beans, we first need to determine how many red jelly beans there are in total. This can be done by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by the fraction that are red.\n\nOnce we have the total number of red jelly beans, we can then multiply that by the fraction of red jelly beans that are coconut flavored to get the final answer.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations.
