          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key information provided is:\n- The money was shared between Sandra, Amy and Ruth in a 2:1:3 ratio respectively\n- Amy got $50\nTo determine how much Sandra got, I need to understand how ratios work. The 2:1:3 ratio means that for every 1 part Amy gets, Sandra gets 2 parts and Ruth gets 3 parts.\nSince I'm told the dollar amount Amy received ($50), I should be able to calculate Sandra's amount using the ratio. \nThe ratio 2:1 between Sandra and Amy suggests I need to adjust Amy's $50 amount somehow based on Sandra having 2 parts to Amy's 1 part.\nI'm not fully certain if I should multiply or divide Amy's amount by 2 to get Sandra's amount. I may need to double check my understanding of ratios to be sure I adjust Amy's amount correctly to determine Sandra's share.\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the 2:1 ratio between Sandra and Amy, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount of $50 and adjust it by a factor of 2 to determine Sandra's share. \n\nSince Amy is the baseline with 1 part, and Sandra has twice as many parts, we calculate Sandra's amount as:",
