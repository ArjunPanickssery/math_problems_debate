Calculate how many matches he won in the first 100 by multiplying 100 by 50% (0.5) \n2. Calculate how many matches he won in the next 100 by multiplying 100 by 60% (0.6)\n3. Add the number of matches won in each set of 100 to get the total\nNo additional information or tools are needed, as the problem provides all the necessary values and the calculations are straightforward.\n</thinking>\n\nThe correct answer is (B): 110 total matches won. Here's why:\n\nIn Sam's first 100 matches, he won 50% of them. We can calculate the number of matches won like this:",
