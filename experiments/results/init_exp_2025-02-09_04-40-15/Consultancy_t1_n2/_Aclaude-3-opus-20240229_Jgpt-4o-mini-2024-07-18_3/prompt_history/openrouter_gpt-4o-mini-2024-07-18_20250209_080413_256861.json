If there are 75 total chickens, how many hens are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 67.0\nLet x represent the number of roosters\nNumber of hens:9x-5\nTotal:9x-5+x=75\n10x-5=75\n10x=80\nx=8\nNumber of hens: 9(8)-5=67\n#### 67\n(B): 68.0\nLet x represent the number of roosters\nNumber of hens: 9x+5\nTotal: 9x+5+x=75\n10x+5=75\n10x=70\nx=7\nNumber of hens: 9(7)+5=68\n#### 68\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe key steps to solve this problem are:\n1. Set up an equation for the total number of chickens in terms of the number of roosters (x)\n2. Solve the equation to find the number of roosters (x)\n3. Plug the number of roosters into the expression for the number of hens to get the final answer\n\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful for steps 2 and 3 to evaluate the mathematical expressions and equations.

Here's how we arrive at that:\n\nLet x represent the number of roosters. \nThe number of hens is given as 5 less than 9 times the number of roosters. So the number of hens is 9x - 5.\n\nThe total number of chickens is the sum of roosters and hens:\nx + (9x - 5) = 75\n10x - 5 = 75\n10x = 80\nx = 8 \n\nThere are 8 roosters. Plugging this back into the expression for hens:\n9(8) - 5 = 67\n\nTherefore, there are 67 hens on the farm, so answer choice (A) is correct.\n"
