Find the total number of tickets sold by dividing the total revenue by the price per ticket\n2. Divide the total tickets by the number of days to get the average per day\nNo additional tools are needed, as the question can be answered with simple arithmetic based on the provided information.\n</thinking>\n\nTo calculate the average number of tickets Carol sold per day:\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of tickets sold over the 3 days.\nTotal revenue = $960\nPrice per ticket = $4\nTotal tickets = Total revenue / Price per ticket\n             = $960 / $4\n             = 240 tickets\n\nSo Carol sold a total of 240 tickets over the 3 day period.\n\nNow to find the average per day, we divide the total by the number of days:\nAverage tickets per day = Total tickets / Number of days\n                        = 240 / 3 \n                        = 80 tickets per day\n\nTherefore, on average, Carol sold 80 tickets per day during the 3 day exhibition.",
