Here's how we arrive at that:\n\nLet x represent the number of roosters. \nThe number of hens is given as 5 less than 9 times the number of roosters. So the number of hens is 9x - 5.\n\nThe total number of chickens is the sum of roosters and hens:\nx + (9x - 5) = 75\n10x - 5 = 75\n10x = 80\nx = 8 \n\nThere are 8 roosters. Plugging this back into the expression for hens:\n9(8) - 5 = 67\n\nTherefore, there are 67 hens on the farm, so answer choice (A) is correct.",
