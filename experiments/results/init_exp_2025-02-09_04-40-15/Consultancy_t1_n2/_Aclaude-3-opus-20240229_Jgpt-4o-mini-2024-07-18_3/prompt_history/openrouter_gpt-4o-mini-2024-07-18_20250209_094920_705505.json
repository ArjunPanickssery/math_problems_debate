      "content": "QUESTION: Andrew's dog has 12 burrs and six times as many ticks as burrs. How many foreign objects total are caught in the dog's fur?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 84.0\nFirst find how many burrs are caught in the dog's fur: 12 burrs * 6 ticks/burr = 72 ticks\nThen add the number of burrs to find the total number objects: 72 objects + 12 objects = 84 objects\n#### 84\n(B): 30.0\nFirst find how many ticks are caught in the dog's fur: 12 burrs + 6 = 18 ticks\nThen add the number of burrs to find the total number of objects: 18 ticks + 12 burrs = 30 objects\n#### 30\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe question asks for the total number of foreign objects in the dog's fur, which includes both burrs and ticks. The key information provided is:\n- There are 12 burrs \n- There are six times as many ticks as burrs\nTo calculate the total, we first need to determine the number of ticks using the relationship between ticks and burrs. Then we can add the number of ticks to the number of burrs.\nNo additional tools are needed, as the question can be answered with the given information and basic arithmetic.\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the question, Andrew's dog has 12 burrs caught in its fur. We are also told that the dog has six times as many ticks as burrs. \n\nTo find the number of ticks, we can multiply the number of burrs by 6:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12 * 6\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12 * 6\"},\n    \"result\": 72,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe question asks for the total number of foreign objects in the dog's fur, which includes both burrs and ticks.

To get the total number of foreign objects, we add the number of ticks to the number of burrs:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"72 + 12\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"72 + 12\"},\n    \"result\": 84,\n}\n</tool_result>\nSo there are 72 ticks in the dog's fur.

The key steps are:\n1) Multiply the number of burrs by 6 to get the number of ticks \n2) Add the number of ticks to the number of burrs to get the total\n\nChoice (A) follows this correct reasoning and arrives at the right answer of 84 total objects.\n"
