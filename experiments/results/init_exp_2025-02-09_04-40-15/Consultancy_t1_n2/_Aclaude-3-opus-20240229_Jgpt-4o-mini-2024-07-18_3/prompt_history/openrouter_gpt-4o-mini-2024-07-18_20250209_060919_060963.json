      "content": "QUESTION: A school choir needs robes for each of its 30 singers. Currently, the school has only 12 robes so they decided to buy the rest. If each robe costs $2, how much will the school spend?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 36.0\nThe school needs to buy 30 - 12 = 18 robes.\nSo the school will spend 18 x $2 = $36.\n#### 36\n(B): 60.0\nTo find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for all singers who need robes.\nWith 30 singers and $2 per robe, the total cost would be 30 x $2 = $60.\n#### 60\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe question asks how much the school will spend to buy the remaining robes they need. To calculate this, we need to know:\n1. The total number of singers in the choir\n2. The number of robes the school currently has\n3. The cost per robe\n\nAll of this information is provided in the question. No additional tools are needed.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1. Calculate the number of additional robes needed by subtracting the current number of robes from the total number of singers.\n2. Multiply the number of additional robes needed by the cost per robe.\n</thinking>\n\nThe school choir has 30 singers total and currently has 12 robes. To determine how many additional robes are needed, we calculate:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"30 - 12\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"30 - 12\"},\n    \"result\": 18,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe question asks how much the school will spend to buy the remaining robes they need.

The answer (A) 36.0 is correct.\n"
