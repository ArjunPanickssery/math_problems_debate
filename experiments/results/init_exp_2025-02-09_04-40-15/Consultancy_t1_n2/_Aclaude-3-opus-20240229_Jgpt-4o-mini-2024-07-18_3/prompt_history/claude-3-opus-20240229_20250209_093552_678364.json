How many pints of tea did Geraldo drink?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 7.0\n20 gallons = 160 pints\n160/80 = 2 pints\n3.5 * 2 pints = 7 pints\nGeraldo drank 7 pints of tea.\n#### 7\n(B): 5.25\n20 gallons = 120 pints\n120/80 = 1.5 pints\n3.5 * 1.5 pints = 5.25 pints\nGeraldo drank 5.25 pints of tea.\n#### 5.25\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 5.25\n20 gallons = 120 pints\n120/80 = 1.5 pints\n3.5 * 1.5 pints = 5.25 pints\nGeraldo drank 5.25 pints of tea.\n#### 5.25"
