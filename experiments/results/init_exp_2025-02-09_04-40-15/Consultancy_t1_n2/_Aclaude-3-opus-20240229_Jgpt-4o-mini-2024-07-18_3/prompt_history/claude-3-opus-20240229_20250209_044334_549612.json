          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question asks how many bars Mike and Rita got combined. The two possible answers provide different interpretations:\n\n(A) assumes Mike and Rita shared their portion, so together they got 4 bars total (the amount for 1 person).\n\n(B) assumes Mike and Rita each got an equal individual share, so adding their portions together gives 4 + 4 = 8 bars.\n\nTo determine which interpretation is correct, I need to carefully re-read the question. The key is whether it suggests Mike and Rita shared a portion or got separate equal portions.\n</thinking>\n\nThe question states that the box of chocolate bars was shared equally between Mike, Rita and Anita. This wording suggests that each person - Mike, Rita and Anita - got an equal individual portion. It does not imply that Mike and Rita shared a single portion between the two of them.\n\nSince the box contained 12 bars total, and it was split equally 3 ways, each person must have received 12 \u00f7 3 = 4 bars. This means Mike got 4 bars and Rita also got 4 bars individually. Adding their separate portions together, Mike and Rita's combined total is 4 bars, as stated in answer choice (A).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A): Mike and Rita together got a total of 4 bars, not 8 bars. The question asks for their combined amount, but does not state or imply that they shared a single portion between them.",
