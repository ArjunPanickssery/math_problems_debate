          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question provides the number of books Darla has (6), and states that Katie has half as many books as Darla. To calculate the number of books Katie has, I can use the math_eval tool, passing in the expression \"6/2\". \n\nThe question also states that Gary has 5 times the number of books that Darla and Katie have combined. Once I have the number of books Katie has, I can add that to Darla's 6 books to get their combined total. I can then multiply that sum by 5 using the math_eval tool to determine how many books Gary has.\n\nFinally, to calculate the total number of books the three have, I'll need to add together the number of books each person has - Darla's 6, Katie's amount (calculated by the first math_eval call), and Gary's amount (calculated by the second math_eval call). I can do this final addition with a third call to the math_eval tool.\n</thinking>",
