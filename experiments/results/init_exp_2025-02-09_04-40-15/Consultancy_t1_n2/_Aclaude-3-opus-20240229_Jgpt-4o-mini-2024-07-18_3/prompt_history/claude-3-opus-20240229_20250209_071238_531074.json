So how much change did she take?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 10.0\n54*2=$108 is the price of 2 pairs of pants.\n4*33=$132 is the price of 4 shirts.\n108+132=$240 is the total price.\nSo the cashier gave 250-240=$10 change to Laura.\n#### 10\n(A): -32\n33*2=$66 is the price of 2 pairs of pants\n4*54=$216 is the price of 4 shirts\n66+216=$282 is the total price\nSo 250-282=$-32 is the change\n#### -32\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 10.0\n54*2=$108 is the price of 2 pairs of pants.\n4*33=$132 is the price of 4 shirts.\n108+132=$240 is the total price.\nSo the cashier gave 250-240=$10 change to Laura.\n#### 10"
