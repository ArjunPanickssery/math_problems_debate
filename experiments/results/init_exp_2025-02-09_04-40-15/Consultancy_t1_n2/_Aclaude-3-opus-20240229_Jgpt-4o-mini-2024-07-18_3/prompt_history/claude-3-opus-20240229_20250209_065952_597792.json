      "content": "QUESTION: Hilary is shucking corn from ears that grew on her farm. She gets four ears of corn per stalk, and she has 108 stalks growing. Half the ears of corn have 500 kernels of corn and the other half have 100 more. How many kernels of corn does Hilary have to shuck?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 237600.0\nShe has 108 * 4 = 432 ears of corn to shuck.\nShe gets 500 kernels of corn from half the ears and 500 + 100 = 600 kernels from the other half.\nHalf the number of ears of corn is 432 / 2 = 216 ears.\nThus, Hilary has 216 * 500 + 216 * 600 = 108000 + 129600 = 237600 kernels to shuck.\n#### 237600\n(B): 259200\nShe has 108 * 4 = 432 ears of corn to shuck.\nEach ear of corn has 500 kernels as a base amount.\nAdding the additional 100 kernels to each ear gives 600 kernels per ear.\nThus, Hilary has 432 * 600 = 259200 kernels to shuck.\n#### 259200\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 237600.0\nShe has 108 * 4 = 432 ears of corn to shuck.\nShe gets 500 kernels of corn from half the ears and 500 + 100 = 600 kernels from the other half.\nHalf the number of ears of corn is 432 / 2 = 216 ears.\nThus, Hilary has 216 * 500 + 216 * 600 = 108000 + 129600 = 237600 kernels to shuck.\n#### 237600"

      "content": "<thinking>\nThe key information provided in the question is:\n- Hilary has 108 stalks of corn\n- Each stalk produces 4 ears of corn\n- Half the ears have 500 kernels\n- The other half of the ears have 100 more kernels than 500, which is 600 kernels\n\nTo calculate the total number of kernels Hilary has to shuck, we need to:\n1. Find the total number of ears of corn by multiplying the number of stalks by the ears per stalk\n2. Determine how many ears have 500 kernels and how many have 600 kernels \n3. Multiply the number of 500 kernel ears by 500\n4. Multiply the number of 600 kernel ears by 600\n5. Add the results from steps 3 and 4 together to get the total kernels\n\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful for doing the calculations in each step.
