      "content": "QUESTION: Two companies A and B, are selling bottled milk. Company A sells a big bottle for $4 and Company B sells a big bottle for $3.5. Company A was able to sell 300 and company B 350 big bottles of milk. How much more money did one company make from the other?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 25.0\nCompany A earned 300 * 4 = $1200 for big bottles of milk.\nCompany B earned 350 * 3.5 = $1225 for big bottles of milk.\nCompany B earned 1225 - 1200 = $25 more than company A.\n#### 25\n(A): 325.0\nCompany A sells at $4 and Company B at $3.5, a difference of $0.5 per bottle.\nTotal bottles sold were 300 + 350 = 650 bottles.\nThe difference in earnings was 0.5 * 650 = $325.\n#### 325\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 25.0\nCompany A earned 300 * 4 = $1200 for big bottles of milk.\nCompany B earned 350 * 3.5 = $1225 for big bottles of milk.\nCompany B earned 1225 - 1200 = $25 more than company A.\n#### 25"

      "content": "<thinking>\nThe question asks how much more money one company made compared to the other. To calculate this, we need to:\n1. Calculate the total revenue for each company by multiplying the number of bottles sold by the price per bottle\n2. Subtract the smaller revenue from the larger revenue to get the difference\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The required expr parameter can be inferred from the given information:\n- Company A revenue: 300 * 4\n- Company B revenue: 350 * 3.5\n- Difference: Company B revenue - Company A revenue\n\nSo the math_eval tool should be sufficient to answer this question. No additional information is needed from the user.\n</thinking>",
