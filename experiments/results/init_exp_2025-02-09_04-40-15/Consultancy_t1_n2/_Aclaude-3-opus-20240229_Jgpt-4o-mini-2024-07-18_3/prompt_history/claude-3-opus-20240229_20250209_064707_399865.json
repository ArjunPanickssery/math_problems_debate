Find the number of books Katie has (half of Darla's)\n2. Add Darla and Katie's books together \n3. Multiply that sum by 5 to get Gary's books\n4. Add Darla, Katie and Gary's books together for the total\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The values for the number of books each person has can be directly plugged into the tool.\n</thinking>",
