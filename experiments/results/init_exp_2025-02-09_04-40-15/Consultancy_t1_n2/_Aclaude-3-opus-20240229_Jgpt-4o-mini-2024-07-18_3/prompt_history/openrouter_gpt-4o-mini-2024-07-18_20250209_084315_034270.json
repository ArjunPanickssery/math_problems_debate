      "content": "QUESTION: Sam shared a sum of money between his three cousins Sandra, Amy and Ruth in the ratio 2:1:3 respectively. If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100\n(B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe key information given is:\n- The ratio of money shared between Sandra, Amy and Ruth is 2:1:3\n- Amy got $50\nTo determine how much Sandra got, we need to use the ratio and the amount Amy received. No additional tools are needed since we can directly calculate Sandra's amount from the given information.\n</thinking>\n\nBased on the ratio of 2:1:3 that Sam used to divide the money between Sandra, Amy and Ruth, we know that for every 1 part Amy received, Sandra got 2 parts.\n\nSince we are told Amy's amount was $50, we can calculate Sandra's portion like this:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"50 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"50 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 100,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe key information given is:\n- The ratio of money shared between Sandra, Amy and Ruth is 2:1:3\n- Amy got $50\nTo determine how much Sandra got, we need to use the ratio and the amount Amy received. No additional tools are needed since we can directly calculate Sandra's amount from the given information.\n</thinking>\n\nBased on the ratio of 2:1:3 that Sam used to divide the money between Sandra, Amy and Ruth, we know that for every 1 part Amy received, Sandra got 2 parts.\n\nSince we are told Amy's amount was $50, we can calculate Sandra's portion like this:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"50 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"50 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 100,\n}\n</tool_result>\nTherefore, if Amy got $50, then Sandra must have received $100, which is double Amy's amount, based on the 2:1 ratio between their portions. The math clearly shows that answer choice (A) 100.0 is correct.\n"
