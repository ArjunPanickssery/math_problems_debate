How many yellow crayons are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 32.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:5+14=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)-6=32 crayons\n#### 32\n(A): 44.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:14+5=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)+6=44 crayons\n#### 44\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 32.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:5+14=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)-6=32 crayons\n#### 32"

The math_eval tool could be used to add 14 and 5 to get the number of blue crayons.\n\nOnce we have the number of blue crayons, we need to double that number and subtract 6 to get the number of yellow crayons. The math_eval tool can be used again for this calculation.\n\nSo the plan is:\n1. Use math_eval to calculate the number of blue crayons \n2. Use the result from step 1 in another math_eval to calculate the number of yellow crayons\n</thinking>",
