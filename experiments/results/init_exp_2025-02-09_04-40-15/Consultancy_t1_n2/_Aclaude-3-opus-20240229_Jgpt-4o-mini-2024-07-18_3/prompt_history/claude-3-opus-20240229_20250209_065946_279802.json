The key information provided is:\n- There are 12 burrs \n- There are six times as many ticks as burrs\nTo calculate the total, we first need to determine the number of ticks using the relationship between ticks and burrs. Then we can add the number of ticks to the number of burrs.\nNo additional tools are needed, as the question can be answered with the given information and basic arithmetic.\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the question, Andrew's dog has 12 burrs caught in its fur. We are also told that the dog has six times as many ticks as burrs. \n\nTo find the number of ticks, we can multiply the number of burrs by 6:",
