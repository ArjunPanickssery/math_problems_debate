      "content": "QUESTION: John starts climbing a very steep hill.  He travels 1 foot vertically for every two feet horizontally.  His elevation increases from 100 feet to 1450 feet.  How far does he move horizontally, in feet?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2700.0\nHe travels 1450-100=1350 feet vertically\nSo he travels 1350*2=2700 feet horizontally\n#### 2700\n(B): 2900.0\nHe reaches an elevation of 1450 feet\nSince he moves 2 feet horizontally for each vertical foot, he travels 1450*2=2900 feet horizontally\n#### 2900\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 2700.0\nHe travels 1450-100=1350 feet vertically\nSo he travels 1350*2=2700 feet horizontally\n#### 2700"

Calculate the change in elevation (vertical distance)\n2. Use the ratio of vertical to horizontal distance to find the horizontal distance\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The change in elevation would be the input for the first calculation. Then the output of that (the vertical distance) multiplied by 2 would give the horizontal distance.\n\nSo the plan is:\n1. Use math_eval to calculate 1450 - 100 to get the change in elevation \n2. Take that result and multiply by 2 using math_eval to get the horizontal distance\n</thinking>",
