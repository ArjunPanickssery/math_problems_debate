The answer I am arguing for is incorrect.\n\nTo get 12 packs, you would calculate 6 classes * 2 packs per class. However, the question states John buys 2 packs for each student, not each class. \n\nTo get the correct answer, you need to first calculate the total number of students by multiplying the number of classes (6) by the number of students per class (30), which equals 180 total students.\n\nThen, since John buys 2 packs per student, you multiply the total students (180) by the packs per student (2) to get 360 total packs purchased.\n\nTherefore, the answer of 12 packs is incorrect based on the information provided in the question. The correct answer is 360 packs.",
