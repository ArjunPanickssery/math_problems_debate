To determine how many apples Kayla picked, we need to set up an equation using a variable to represent the unknown number of apples Kylie picked.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to solve the resulting equation for the variable representing Kylie's apples. Once we have the value for Kylie's apples, we can calculate Kayla's apples using the relationship provided.\n\nAll the information needed to set up and solve the equation is provided in the question. No additional tools or information from the user are needed.\n</thinking>",
