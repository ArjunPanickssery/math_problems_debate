How many games did the Bulls and the Heat win together?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 145.0\nThe Heat won 5 more games than the Bulls so they won 70 + 5 = 75 games.\nThe total games won together is 70+75 = 145 games.\n#### 145\n(B): 150.0\nThe Heat won 5 more games than the Bulls (70).\nSo the Heat won 75 games.\nThe total games between them would be 70 + 75 + 5 = 150 games.\n#### 150\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe question asks for the total number of games won by the Bulls and Heat together. The key information provided is:\n- The Bulls won 70 games in 2010\n- The Heat won 5 more games than the Bulls\nTo calculate the total, we need to:\n1. Figure out how many games the Heat won based on the Bulls' total\n2. Add the Bulls' and Heat's wins together\nNo tools are needed since the math is straightforward addition that can be done mentally.\n</thinking>\n\nThe Bulls won 70 games in 2010. The question states that the Heat won 5 more games than the Bulls that year. \n\nTo calculate how many games the Heat won, we take the Bulls' 70 wins and add 5:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"70 + 5\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"70 + 5\"},\n    \"result\": 75,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe question asks for the total number of games won by the Bulls and Heat together.
