      "content": "QUESTION: Asia bought a homecoming dress on sale for $140. It was originally priced at $350. What percentage off did she get at the sale?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nAsia saved $350 - $140 = $210 on the dress.\nThat means she saved $210 / $350 = 0.60 or 60% off on the dress.\n#### 60\n(A): 150\nFind the difference: $350 - $140 = $210\nCalculate the percentage off: $210/$140 = 1.5 or 150%\n#### 150\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe key information provided is:\n- Original price of dress: $350\n- Sale price of dress: $140\nTo calculate the percentage off, we need to:\n1. Find the difference between the original and sale price \n2. Divide that difference by the original price\n3. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful for steps 1 and 2.

Therefore, the percentage off that Asia got on the dress was 60%.\n\nWhile the given answer of 150% was calculated by dividing the $210 difference by the sale price of $140 rather than the original price, the correct calculation is to divide the difference by the original price. This results in a 60% discount, not 150%.\n"
