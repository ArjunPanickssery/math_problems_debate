How old am I now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 17.0\nIn 2 years, my dog will be 4 years old, so my dog is 4 - 2 = 2 years old now.\nSo I am 15 + 2 = 17 years old now.\n#### 17\n(B): 19.0\nI was 15 when my dog was born. My dog will be 4 years old in 2 years.\nSo my current age is 15 + 4 = 19 years old.\n#### 19\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe key information given is:\n- I was 15 years old when my dog was born\n- In 2 years, my dog will be 4 years old\nTo determine my current age, I need to figure out:\n1. How old my dog is currently \n2. How many years have passed since my dog was born, which is the same as how many years older I am now compared to when my dog was born.\nThe math_eval tool could be used to calculate my dog's current age by subtracting 2 from the age it will be in 2 years. \nThen that result could be added to my age when the dog was born to get my current age.\n</thinking><tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4 - 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4 - 2\"},\n    \"result\": 2,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe key information given is:\n- I was 15 years old when my dog was born\n- In 2 years, my dog will be 4 years old\nTo determine my current age, I need to figure out:\n1.

The math checks out for the answer I am arguing for.\n"
