      "content": "QUESTION: June made a design with 20 equal tiles. Three tiles are yellow and the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles. Six tiles are purple and the remaining tiles are white.  How many white tiles are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 7.0\nThere are 3 + 1 = 4 blue tiles.\nThere are a total of 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 tiles are yellow, blue, and purple.\nHence, 20 - 13 = 7 tiles are white.\n#### 7\n(B): 10.0\nThe yellow and blue tiles together total 3 + 1 = 4 tiles.\nAdding the purple tiles gives us 4 + 6 = 10 colored tiles.\nTherefore, 20 - 10 = 10 tiles must be white.\n#### 10\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 7.0\nThere are 3 + 1 = 4 blue tiles.\nThere are a total of 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 tiles are yellow, blue, and purple.\nHence, 20 - 13 = 7 tiles are white.\n#### 7"

Calculate the number of blue tiles based on the number of yellow tiles\n2. Sum up the number of yellow, blue, and purple tiles\n3. Subtract that sum from the total number of tiles to get the number of white tiles\nNo tools are needed, as this can be done with simple arithmetic based on the given information.\n</thinking>\n\nThe number of white tiles can be calculated as follows:\n\nThere are 3 yellow tiles, and the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles. So there are 3 + 1 = 4 blue tiles.\n\nIn total, there are:\n- 3 yellow tiles \n- 4 blue tiles\n- 6 purple tiles\nSumming those up: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 colored tiles (yellow, blue and purple).\n\nWe know there are 20 tiles in total. So the number of white tiles is the total number of tiles minus the number of colored tiles:\n\n20 - 13 = 7\n\nTherefore, there are 7 white tiles.",
