Subtract the total purchase price from the amount given to the cashier\n\nTo find the total cost of the pants and shirts, I'll need to multiply the number of each item by its price. The question provides the number of pants (2) and shirts (4) purchased, as well as their individual prices ($54 for pants, $33 for shirts).\n\nI can use the math_eval tool to perform the necessary calculations in steps 1-4 above.
