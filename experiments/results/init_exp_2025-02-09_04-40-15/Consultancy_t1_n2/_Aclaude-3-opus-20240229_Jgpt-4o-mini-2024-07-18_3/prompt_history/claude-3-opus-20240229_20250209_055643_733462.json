Once we have Emily's hair length, we can divide it by 2 to get Kate's hair length, since Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1. Calculate Emily's hair length by adding 6 inches to Logan's hair length\n2. Divide Emily's hair length by 2 to get Kate's hair length\n\nNo additional tools are needed, as the question can be answered with the given information and basic arithmetic.\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the information provided, Emily's hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's hair. Since we know that Logan's hair is 20 inches long, we can calculate Emily's hair length as follows:",
