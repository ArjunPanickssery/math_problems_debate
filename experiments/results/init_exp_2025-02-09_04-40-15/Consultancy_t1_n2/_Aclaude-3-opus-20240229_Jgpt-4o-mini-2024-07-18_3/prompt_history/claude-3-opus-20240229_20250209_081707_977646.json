How many of his students got a final grade of B and above if he has 60 students in Grade 5?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 36.0\nSince 40% of his students got below B, 100% - 40% = 60% of Mr. Sanchez's students got B and above.\nThus, 60 x 60/100 = 36 students got B and above in their final grade.\n#### 36\n(B): 24.0\n40% of Mr. Sanchez's students are relevant to our calculation of B and above grades.\nTherefore, 60 \u00d7 40/100 = 24 students got B and above in their final grade.\n#### 24\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 24.0\n40% of Mr. Sanchez's students are relevant to our calculation of B and above grades.\nTherefore, 60 \u00d7 40/100 = 24 students got B and above in their final grade.\n#### 24"

The key information is:\n- There are 60 students total in Grade 5\n- 40% of the students got a final grade below B\nTo determine how many students got B or above, we need to calculate what percentage got B or above, and then multiply that by the total number of students.\nThe provided tools do not seem directly relevant, as this is more of a percentage problem that can be solved with basic arithmetic. No additional information is needed from the user.\n</thinking>\n\nTo calculate how many students got a final grade of B or above, we first need to determine what percentage that represents. We know that 40% of students got below B. Therefore, the remaining percentage of students who got B or above is:",
