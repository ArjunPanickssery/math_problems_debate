Calculate the number of pairs of shoes Anthony has based on the number Scott has\n2. Calculate the number of pairs of shoes Jim has based on the number Anthony has\n3. Subtract Jim's number of pairs from Anthony's to get the difference\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The required expr parameter can be inferred from the given information in the question.\n</thinking>",
