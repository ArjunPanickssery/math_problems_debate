          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key steps to solve this problem are:\n1. Convert gallons to pints \n2. Determine how many pints are in each container\n3. Multiply the pints per container by the number of containers Geraldo drank\n\nTo convert gallons to pints, we can use the conversion 1 gallon = 8 pints. This can be done with a simple multiplication.\n\nTo calculate the pints per container, we need to divide the total pints by the number of containers. \n\nFinally, multiplying the pints per container by the containers Geraldo drank will give the total pints he consumed.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful to perform these calculations. The conversion from gallons to pints and calculating the pints per container could each be done with one call to math_eval. A final call could multiply the pints per container by 3.5 to get Geraldo's total consumption.\n\nAll the required information is provided in the problem statement, so no additional information is needed from the user to proceed with the tool calls.\n</thinking>",
