How many total toys does he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nHe buys 2*20=40 toy cars\nSo the total number of toys is 20+40=60\n#### 60\n(A): 40.0\nHe buys twice as many toy soldiers as cars\nThis means he buys 2*20=40 toy soldiers\nThis is the total number of toys\n#### 40\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 60.0\nHe buys 2*20=40 toy cars\nSo the total number of toys is 20+40=60\n#### 60"
