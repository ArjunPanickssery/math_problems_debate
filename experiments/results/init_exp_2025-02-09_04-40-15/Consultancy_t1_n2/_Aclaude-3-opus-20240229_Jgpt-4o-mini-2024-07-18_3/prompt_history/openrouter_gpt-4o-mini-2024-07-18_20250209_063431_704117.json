      "content": "QUESTION: Sam has 18 cows.  5 more than half the cows are black.  How many cows are not black?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 4.0\nHalf of the cows: 18/2=9\nBlack cows: 5+9=14\n18-14=4 cows\n#### 4\n(B): 6\nTotal cows plus 5: 18+5 = 23\nHalf of 23 (rounded): 12\nThese are black cows\nNon-black cows: 18-12 = 6\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe question asks how many of Sam's cows are not black, given that 5 more than half the cows are black. The key pieces of information are:\n- Sam has 18 cows total\n- 5 more than half the cows are black\nTo determine the number of non-black cows, we need to:\n1. Calculate how many cows are black based on the \"5 more than half\" information \n2. Subtract the number of black cows from the total of 18 cows\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful in performing these calculations precisely. The expr parameter can be used to specify the mathematical expressions needed.\n</thinking><tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"18 / 2 + 5\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"18 / 2 + 5\"},\n    \"result\": 14.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe question asks how many of Sam's cows are not black, given that 5 more than half the cows are black.

This matches the reasoning and answer provided in option (A).\n"
