How many square inches of the box are left uncovered?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 8.0\nThe shoebox is 24 square inches because 4 x 6 = 24\nThe block is 16 square inches because 4 x 4 = 16\nThere are 8 square inches uncovered because 24 - 16 = 8\n#### 8\n(B): 4\nThe shoebox perimeter is 20 (4 + 6) \u00d7 2\nThe block perimeter is 16: 4 \u00d7 4\nThe uncovered space is 20 - 16\n#### 4\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 8.0\nThe shoebox is 24 square inches because 4 x 6 = 24\nThe block is 16 square inches because 4 x 4 = 16\nThere are 8 square inches uncovered because 24 - 16 = 8\n#### 8"

Subtract the block area from the shoebox base area\nThe question provides all the necessary information to perform these calculations, so no additional tools are needed.\n</thinking>\n\nTo determine the uncovered area in the shoebox, we first calculate the area of the shoebox base. The shoebox is 6 inches wide and 4 inches tall, so the base has dimensions of 6 inches by 4 inches. ",
