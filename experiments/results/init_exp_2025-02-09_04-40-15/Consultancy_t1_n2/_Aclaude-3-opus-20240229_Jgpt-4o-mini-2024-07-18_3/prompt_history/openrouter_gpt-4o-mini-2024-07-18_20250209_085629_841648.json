How many bowling balls are there in total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 66.0\nThere are 30 + 6 = 36 green bowling balls\nIn total there are 30 + 36 = 66 bowling balls\n#### 66\n(B): 72.0\nThere are 30 red bowling balls\nFor green balls, we add 6 more than red, so 30 + 6 = 36 green balls\nTotal is 30 + 36 + 6 = 72 bowling balls\n#### 72\n\nPlease note that anything that is included in\n<tool_result></tool_result>\ntags is guaranteed to be true.\n\nContext: ## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nTo argue for answer (A), I need to make the case that there are 36 green bowling balls, and that the total number of bowling balls is the sum of the red and green balls.\n\nThe key points are:\n- There are 30 red bowling balls \n- There are 6 more green bowling balls than red\n- To calculate the number of green balls, add 6 to the number of red balls\n- The total is the sum of the red and green balls\n\nNo tools are needed, as the question can be answered with the given information and basic arithmetic.\n</thinking>\n\nThe bowling alley has 30 red bowling balls. We're told there are 6 more green bowling balls than red. To calculate the number of green balls, we simply add 6 to the number of red balls:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"30 + 6\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"30 + 6\"},\n    \"result\": 36,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nTo argue for answer (A), I need to make the case that there are 36 green bowling balls, and that the total number of bowling balls is the sum of the red and green balls.\n\nThe key points are:\n- There are 30 red bowling balls \n- There are 6 more green bowling balls than red\n- To calculate the number of green balls, add 6 to the number of red balls\n- The total is the sum of the red and green balls\n\nNo tools are needed, as the question can be answered with the given information and basic arithmetic.\n</thinking>\n\nThe bowling alley has 30 red bowling balls.

To get the total, we add the number of red and green balls:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"30 + 36\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"30 + 36\"},\n    \"result\": 66,\n}\n</tool_result>\nSo there are 36 green bowling balls.
