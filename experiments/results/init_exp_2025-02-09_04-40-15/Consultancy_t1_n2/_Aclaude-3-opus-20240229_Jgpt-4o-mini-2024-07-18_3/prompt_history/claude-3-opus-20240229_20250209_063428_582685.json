How tall is he in feet?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 6.0\nHe gained 2*3=6 inches\nSo his height is 66+6=72 inches\nSo he is 72/12=6 feet tall\n#### 6\n(B): 17.0\nFirst find total change in height:\n(66+2)*3 = 68*3 = 204 inches\nConvert to feet: 204/12 = 17 feet\n#### 17.0\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 6.0\nHe gained 2*3=6 inches\nSo his height is 66+6=72 inches\nSo he is 72/12=6 feet tall\n#### 6"

Find the total growth in inches by multiplying the growth per month by the number of months\n2. Add the total growth to the starting height to get the final height in inches \n3. Convert the final height from inches to feet by dividing by 12\n\nThe math_eval tool could be useful for steps 1-3 to perform the arithmetic.
