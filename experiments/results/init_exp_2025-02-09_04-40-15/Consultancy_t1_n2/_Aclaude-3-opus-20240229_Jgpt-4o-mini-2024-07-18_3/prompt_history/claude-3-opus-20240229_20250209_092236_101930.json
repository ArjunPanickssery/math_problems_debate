How many more of these books has Peter read than his brother?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 6.0\nPeter has read 8 of these books because 20 x .4 = 8\nHis brother has read 2 of these books because 20 x .1 = 2\nPeter has read 6 more books than his brother because 8 - 2 = 6\n#### 6\n(B): 120\nPeter has read 8 of these books because 20 x .4 = 8\nHis brother has read 2 of these books because 20 x .1 = 2\nThe difference of 6 books needs to be scaled by the total collection size of 20 books to get the final answer: 6 x 20 = 120\n#### 120\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 120\nPeter has read 8 of these books because 20 x .4 = 8\nHis brother has read 2 of these books because 20 x .1 = 2\nThe difference of 6 books needs to be scaled by the total collection size of 20 books to get the final answer: 6 x 20 = 120\n#### 120"

The relevant information is:\n- Peter has 20 books total\n- Peter has read 40% of the books\n- Peter's brother has read 10% of the books\nTo calculate the number of books each brother has read, we need to multiply the total number of books by the percentage read. Then to find the difference, we subtract the number of books the brother read from the number Peter read.\nNo additional tools are needed, as the question can be answered with the given information and basic math calculations.\n</thinking>\n\nTo determine how many more books Peter has read than his brother, we first calculate the number of books each brother has read:",
