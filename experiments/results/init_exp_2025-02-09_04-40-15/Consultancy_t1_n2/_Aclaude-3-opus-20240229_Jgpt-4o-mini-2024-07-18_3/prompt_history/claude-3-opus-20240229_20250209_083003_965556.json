We need to determine the amount she had before buying her brother the book, and then the amount she had before buying the toy. This will tell us the initial amount she started with.\n\nTo calculate the previous amount before each purchase, we can multiply the current amount by 2, since she spent half the money each time.\n\nNo additional tools are needed, as the problem can be solved with simple multiplication.
