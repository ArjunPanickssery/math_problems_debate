          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key to solving this problem is calculating the savings amount for each month based on doubling the previous month's amount, starting with $10 in January.\n\nTo check the math for each answer:\n\n(B) 160:\nJan: 10\nFeb: 10 * 2 = 20\nMar: 20 * 2 = 40 \nApr: 40 * 2 = 80\nMay: 80 * 2 = 160\n\nThis matches the explanation given and the math checks out.\n\n(A) 810:\nJan: 10 \nFeb: 10 + 20 = 30\nMar: 30 + 60 = 90\nApr: 90 + 180 = 270\nMay: 270 + 540 = 810\n\nThe explanation is adding the previous and current month amounts instead of doubling. This does not match the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the math supports answer (B) as being correct. No tools are needed since the calculations are straightforward.\n</thinking>\n\nThe correct answer is (B) 160. The explanation clearly shows how Brianne's savings double each month, starting with $10 in January:\n\nJanuary: $10 \nFebruary: $10 x 2 = $20\nMarch: $20 x 2 = $40\nApril: $40 x 2 = $80 \nMay: $80 x 2 = $160\n\nBy consistently doubling the previous month's savings, Brianne will save $160 in May. The math is straightforward and aligns with the problem statement.\n\nIn contrast, answer (A) incorrectly adds the previous and current month savings each time, rather than doubling the previous month. This does not match the description of Brianne doubling her savings each month.\n\nFollowing the problem's logic of doubling the prior month's amount gives the correct May savings of $160.",
