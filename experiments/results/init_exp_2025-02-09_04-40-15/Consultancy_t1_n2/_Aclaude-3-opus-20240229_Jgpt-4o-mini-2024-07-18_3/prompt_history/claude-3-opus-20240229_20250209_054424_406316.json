To determine the number of slightly used crayons, we need to:\n1. Calculate the number of new crayons using the 1/3 fraction\n2. Calculate the number of broken crayons using the 20% percentage \n3. Subtract the new and broken crayons from the total to get the number of slightly used crayons\nThe math_eval tool can be used to perform these calculations. All the required parameters are provided in the question.\n</thinking>",
