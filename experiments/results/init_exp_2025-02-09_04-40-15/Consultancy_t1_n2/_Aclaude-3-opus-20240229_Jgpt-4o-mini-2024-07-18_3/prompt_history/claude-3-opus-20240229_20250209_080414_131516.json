      "content": "QUESTION: If Stu has 9 books and Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu, how many books do Stu and Albert have in total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 45.0\nAlbert has 4 * 9 books belonging to Stu = 36 books.\nSo the pair have a combined total of 36 books belonging to Albert + 9 books belonging to Stu = 45 books.\n#### 45\n(B): 22.0\nFirst we determine Albert's books by taking Stu's 9 books and adding 4 for each book of Stu's = 13 books.\nThen we add both collections together: 13 + 9 = 22 books total.\n#### 22\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 22.0\nFirst we determine Albert's books by taking Stu's 9 books and adding 4 for each book of Stu's = 13 books.\nThen we add both collections together: 13 + 9 = 22 books total.\n#### 22"

We are given that Stu has 9 books, and Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu.\n\nTo calculate Albert's books, we could use the math_eval tool, passing in an expression like \"9 * 4\". This would give us the number of books Albert has.\n\nThen, to get the total, we could call math_eval again, passing in Albert's book count plus Stu's 9 books.\n\nSo the key steps are:\n1. Use math_eval to calculate Albert's book count \n2. Use math_eval again to add Albert and Stu's books together for the total\n</thinking>",
