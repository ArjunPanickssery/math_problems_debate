      "content": "QUESTION: Carol sells tickets for an exhibition. During three days she sold tickets worth $960. One ticket costs $4. How many tickets on average did she sell during one of these three days?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 80.0\nCarol sold 960 / 4 = 240 tickets during three days.\nSo in one day, she sold on average 240 / 3 = 80 tickets.\n#### 80\n(A): 1280\nFirst divide the total money by days to get daily revenue\n$960 / 3 = $320 per day\nThen since each ticket is $4, that means she sold 320 \u00d7 4 = 1280 tickets per day\n#### 1280\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe key information provided in the question is:\n- Carol sold tickets worth $960 over 3 days\n- Each ticket costs $4\nTo calculate the average number of tickets sold per day, we need to:\n1. Find the total number of tickets sold by dividing the total revenue by the price per ticket\n2. Divide the total tickets by the number of days to get the average per day\nNo additional tools are needed, as the question can be answered with simple arithmetic based on the provided information.\n</thinking>\n\nTo calculate the average number of tickets Carol sold per day:\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of tickets sold over the 3 days.\nTotal revenue = $960\nPrice per ticket = $4\nTotal tickets = Total revenue / Price per ticket\n             = $960 / $4\n             = 240 tickets\n\nSo Carol sold a total of 240 tickets over the 3 day period.\n\nNow to find the average per day, we divide the total by the number of days:\nAverage tickets per day = Total tickets / Number of days\n                        = 240 / 3 \n                        = 80 tickets per day\n\nTherefore, on average, Carol sold 80 tickets per day during the 3 day exhibition.\n"
