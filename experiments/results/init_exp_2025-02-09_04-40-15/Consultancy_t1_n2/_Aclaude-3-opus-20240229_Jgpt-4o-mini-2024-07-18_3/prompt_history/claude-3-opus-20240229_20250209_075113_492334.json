Find out how many marbles Katrina has, since Mabel and Amanda's marble counts are based on Katrina's. I can calculate this by dividing Mabel's 85 marbles by 5, since Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina.\n2. Calculate how many marbles Amanda has. I know Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many as Katrina. So I can multiply Katrina's marble count by 2 and add 12 to get Amanda's total.\n3.
