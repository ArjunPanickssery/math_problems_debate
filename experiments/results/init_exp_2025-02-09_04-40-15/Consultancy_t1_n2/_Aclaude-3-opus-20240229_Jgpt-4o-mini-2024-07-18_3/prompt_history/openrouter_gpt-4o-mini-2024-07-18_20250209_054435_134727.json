If the box contains 12 bars, how many bars did Mike and Rita get (combined)?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 8.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nMike and Rita together got 4+4 = 8 bars\n#### 8\n(A): 4.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nSince Mike and Rita shared the bars, they got 4 bars together\n#### 4\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe question is asking how many chocolate bars Mike and Rita got combined, given that a box of 12 bars was shared equally between Mike, Rita and Anita. To calculate this, we need to:\n\n1. Determine how many bars each person got (12 bars divided by 3 people)\n2. Add together the number of bars Mike and Rita each received \n\nNo tools are needed, as the problem can be solved with simple arithmetic. The question provides all the necessary information.\n</thinking>\n\nThe box of chocolate bars was shared equally between Mike, Rita and Anita.

The box was shared equally, so they each received 4 bars, which sums to 8 bars for the two of them together.\n"
