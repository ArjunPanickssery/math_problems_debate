The key information is:\n- 4 dog biscuits per evening \n- $0.25 per dog biscuit\n- 2 rawhide bones per evening\n- $1 per rawhide bone\n- Calculating the cost for a week (7 days)\n\nTo calculate the total, I need to:\n1. Calculate the cost of dog biscuits per evening \n2. Calculate the cost of dog biscuits for the week\n3. Calculate the cost of rawhide bones per evening\n4. Calculate the cost of rawhide bones for the week\n5. Add the weekly costs of dog biscuits and rawhide bones\n\nThe math_eval tool can help with the individual calculations. I have all the information I need to proceed with the tool calls in the order outlined above.\n</thinking>",
