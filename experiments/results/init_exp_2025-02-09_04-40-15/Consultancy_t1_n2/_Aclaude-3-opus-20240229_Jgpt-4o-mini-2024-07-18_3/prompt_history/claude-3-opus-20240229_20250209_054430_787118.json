How many meters of ribbon are not used?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 10.0\nEach part is 30/6 = 5 meters long.\nSince Liam used 4 parts, then he used 5 x 4 = 20 meters of the ribbon.\nSo, 30 - 20 = 10 meters of ribbon is not used.\n#### 10\n(B): 15.0\nThe ribbon was cut into 6 parts, and 4 were used, leaving 2 parts unused.\nEach part is 30/4 = 7.5 meters long.\nTherefore 2 \u00d7 7.5 = 15 meters were not used.\n#### 15\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 10.0\nEach part is 30/6 = 5 meters long.\nSince Liam used 4 parts, then he used 5 x 4 = 20 meters of the ribbon.\nSo, 30 - 20 = 10 meters of ribbon is not used.\n#### 10"

      "content": "<thinking>\nThe key information provided in the question is:\n- The ribbon is 30 meters long\n- It was cut into 6 equal parts\n- 4 parts were used\nTo determine how many meters were not used, we first need to calculate the length of each part by dividing the total length by the number of parts. Then we can multiply the length of each part by the number of parts used to get the total length used. Finally, we subtract the used length from the total length to get the unused length.\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful in performing these calculations. We have the necessary information to provide the expressions as parameters.\n</thinking>",
