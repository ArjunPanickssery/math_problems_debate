How much did Sheryll pay in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 45.0\nInstead of $5 each, a book costs $5 - $0.5 = $4.5 each.\nSheryll paid $4.5/book x 10 books = $45.\n#### 45\n(B): 55.0\nThe regular price is $5 per book.\nThe $0.5 discount is added to each book's price: $5 + $0.5 = $5.5 per book.\nTotal cost is $5.5 \u00d7 10 = $55.\n#### 55\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 55.0\nThe regular price is $5 per book.\nThe $0.5 discount is added to each book's price: $5 + $0.5 = $5.5 per book.\nTotal cost is $5.5 \u00d7 10 = $55.\n#### 55"
