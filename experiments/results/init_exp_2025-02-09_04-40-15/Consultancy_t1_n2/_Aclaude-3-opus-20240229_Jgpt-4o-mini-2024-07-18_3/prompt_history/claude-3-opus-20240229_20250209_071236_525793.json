Determine what fraction of the Biology class are boys, given that there are 3 times as many girls as boys\n\nThe problem statement gives us the total number of students in the Physics class (200) and tells us the Biology class has half as many students. So we can calculate the number of Biology students by dividing the Physics class size by 2.\n\nOnce we have the total Biology class size, we need to determine how to calculate the number of boys. The key information is that there are 3 times as many girls as boys. This means the class can be divided into 4 equal parts - 3 parts girls and 1 part boys. \n\nTo get the number of boys, we can divide the total class size by 4. No additional information or tools are needed.\n</thinking>\n\nHere is how we can calculate the number of boys in the Biology class:\n\nThe Physics class has 200 students, and we're told the Biology class has half as many students.
