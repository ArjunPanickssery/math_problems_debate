      "content": "QUESTION: A certain kind of wild mushroom has either spots or gills, but never both. Gilled mushrooms are rare, with only one growing for every nine spotted mushrooms that grow. A fallen log had 30 mushrooms growing on its side. How many gilled mushrooms were on the fallen log\u2019s side?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 3.0\nThere is 1 gilled mushroom for every 1 + 9 = 10 mushrooms.\nThus, there were 30 / 10 = 3 gilled mushrooms on the fallen log\u2019s side.\n#### 3\n(A): 27\nFor every 9 spotted mushrooms, we have 1 gilled mushroom.\nThis means that out of every 10 mushrooms, 9 must be gilled.\nTherefore, 9/10 of the total mushrooms are gilled.\n9/10 of 30 = 27 gilled mushrooms.\n#### 27\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 27\nFor every 9 spotted mushrooms, we have 1 gilled mushroom.\nThis means that out of every 10 mushrooms, 9 must be gilled.\nTherefore, 9/10 of the total mushrooms are gilled.\n9/10 of 30 = 27 gilled mushrooms.\n#### 27"
