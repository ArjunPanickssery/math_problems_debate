If Logan hair is 20 inches, how many inches is Kate\u2019s hair?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 7.0\nEmily\u2019s hair is 20-6 = 14 inches long.\nKate's hair 14/2= 7 inches long.\n#### 7\n(A): 13\nEmily's hair is 20+6 = 26 inches long.\nKate's hair is 26/2 = 13 inches long.\n#### 13\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe question provides the following information:\n- Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's hair\n- Emily's hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's hair\n- Logan's hair is 20 inches long\n\nTo determine the length of Kate's hair, we first need to calculate the length of Emily's hair using the information about Logan's hair length. Once we have Emily's hair length, we can calculate Kate's hair length since it is half of Emily's.\n\nNo additional tools are needed, as the question can be answered with the given information and basic arithmetic.\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the given information, Emily's hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's hair. Since we know Logan's hair is 20 inches long, we can calculate Emily's hair length:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"20 + 6\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"20 + 6\"},\n    \"result\": 26,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe question provides the following information:\n- Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's hair\n- Emily's hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's hair\n- Logan's hair is 20 inches long\n\nTo determine the length of Kate's hair, we first need to calculate the length of Emily's hair using the information about Logan's hair length.

Now that we know Emily's hair length, we can calculate Kate's hair length, which is half of Emily's:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"26 / 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"26 / 2\"},\n    \"result\": 13.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nSo Emily's hair is 26 inches long.

The reasoning in answer choice (B) incorrectly subtracts 6 inches from Logan's hair length to get Emily's hair length, when it should add 6 inches. This leads to the incorrect conclusion that Kate's hair is 7 inches long.\n"
