If she has 90 green houses, how many of her houses are not yellow?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 160.0\nIf the number of green houses is three times the number of yellow houses, and there are 90 green houses, then there are 90/3 = 30 yellow houses.\nShe also has 40 fewer yellow houses than blue houses, meaning there are 30+40 = 70 blue houses.\nThe number of houses that are not yellow is 70 blue houses +90 green houses = 160\n#### 160\n(A): 200.0\nIf green houses are three times yellow houses, and there are 90 green houses, then there are 90/3 = 30 yellow houses.\nYellow houses are 40 fewer than red houses, so there are 70 red houses.\nTo find all non-yellow houses, we add green houses (90) and red houses (70).\nThen we need to add the difference of 40 between red and yellow to get all non-yellow houses: 90 + 70 + 40 = 200\n#### 200\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 160.0\nIf the number of green houses is three times the number of yellow houses, and there are 90 green houses, then there are 90/3 = 30 yellow houses.\nShe also has 40 fewer yellow houses than blue houses, meaning there are 30+40 = 70 blue houses.\nThe number of houses that are not yellow is 70 blue houses +90 green houses = 160\n#### 160"

Calculate the number of yellow houses based on the number of green houses\n2. Use the number of yellow houses to determine the number of red houses\n3. Add up the green houses and red houses to get the total non-yellow houses\n\nNo tools seem necessary here, as the problem can be solved with basic arithmetic based on the given information.\n</thinking>\n\nOkay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n\nFirst, we know Isabella has 3 times as many green houses as yellow houses. She has 90 green houses total. To find the number of yellow houses, we can divide the number of green houses by 3:",
