If there are 45 pirates, how many noodles and pirates are there in total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 83.0\nIn the matrix, there are seven fewer noodles than pirates, meaning there are 45-7=38 noodles.\nThe number of noodles and pirates in the matrix is 38+45=83\n#### 83\n(A): 97.0\nIn the matrix, there are seven fewer noodles than pirates, meaning there are 45+7=52 noodles.\nThe number of noodles and pirates in the matrix is 52+45=97\n#### 97\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 97.0\nIn the matrix, there are seven fewer noodles than pirates, meaning there are 45+7=52 noodles.\nThe number of noodles and pirates in the matrix is 52+45=97\n#### 97"
