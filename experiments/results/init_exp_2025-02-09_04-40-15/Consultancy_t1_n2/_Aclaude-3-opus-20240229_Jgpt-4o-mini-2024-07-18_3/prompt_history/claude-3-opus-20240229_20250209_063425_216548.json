If the Biology class has half as many students as the Physics class, how many boys are in the Biology class?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 25.0\nThe Biology class has 200/2=100 students.\nThe boys in the Biology class are 1/4*100=25 students.\n#### 25\n(B): 33.33\nThe Biology class has 200/2=100 students.\nSince there are three times as many girls, divide total by 3 to get boys: 100/3\u224833.33\n#### 33.33\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 25.0\nThe Biology class has 200/2=100 students.\nThe boys in the Biology class are 1/4*100=25 students.\n#### 25"

This can be done by dividing the number of Physics students by 2, since we're told the Biology class is half the size.\nOnce we have the total Biology students, we need to determine what fraction of the class the boys make up. Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, the boys are 1/4 of the total (1 part boys, 3 parts girls).\nFinally, we can multiply the total Biology students by 1/4 to get the number of boys.\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The required expr parameter can be inferred from the problem statement and thinking above.\n</thinking>",
