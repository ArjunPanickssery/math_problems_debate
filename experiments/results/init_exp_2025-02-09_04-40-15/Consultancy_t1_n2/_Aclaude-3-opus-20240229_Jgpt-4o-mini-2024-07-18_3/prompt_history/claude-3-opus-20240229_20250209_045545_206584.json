      "content": "<thinking>\nThe question asks how many apples Kayla picked, given that the total number of apples picked by Kylie and Kayla is 340, and that Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked.\n\nTo determine the number of apples Kayla picked, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let x be the number of apples Kylie picked. Then Kayla picked 4x + 10 apples.\n\nThe total number of apples is the sum of the apples picked by Kylie and Kayla:\nx + (4x + 10) = 340\n\nThis equation can be solved for x to determine the number of apples Kylie picked. Once we have the value of x, we can calculate the number of apples Kayla picked using the expression 4x + 10.\n\nNo additional information or tools are needed to solve this problem, as all the necessary information is provided in the question.\n</thinking>",
