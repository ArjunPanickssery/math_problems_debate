How many men are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 420.0\nThe percentage for women is 100% - 70% = 30%.\nSince 180 represents 30%, then 180/30 = 6 students represent 1%.\nHence, 6 x 70 = 420 students are men.\n#### 420\n(B): 126\nSince 70% of students are men, we can find the number by taking 70% of 180:\n180 \u00d7 0.7 = 126 men in the department.\n#### 126\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 126\nSince 70% of students are men, we can find the number by taking 70% of 180:\n180 \u00d7 0.7 = 126 men in the department.\n#### 126"

The key information provided is:\n- 70% of the students are men\n- There are 180 women in the department\nTo calculate the number of men, we could either:\n1. Calculate the total number of students first, then take 70% of that total\n2. Use the fact that the 180 women represent the remaining 30% to calculate the total, then subtract 180 from the total to get the number of men\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful in performing the percentage calculations once we have the total number of students.\n</thinking>",
