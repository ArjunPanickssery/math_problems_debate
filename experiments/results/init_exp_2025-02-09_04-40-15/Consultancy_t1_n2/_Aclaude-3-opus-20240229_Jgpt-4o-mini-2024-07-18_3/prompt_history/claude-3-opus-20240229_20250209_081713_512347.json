          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question asks for the number of hens on a farm, given the total number of chickens and a relationship between the number of hens and roosters. To determine the number of hens, we need to set up an equation based on the given information and solve for the number of roosters first.\n\nThe key pieces of information are:\n- There are 5 less than 9 times the amount of hens as roosters\n- The total number of chickens (hens + roosters) is 75\n\nTo solve this, we can:\n1. Let a variable like x represent the number of roosters\n2. Express the number of hens in terms of x based on the given relationship \n3. Set up an equation with the total number of chickens\n4. Solve the equation for x to determine the number of roosters\n5. Plug the number of roosters into the expression for hens to get the final answer\n\nNo tools are needed since this is a straightforward algebraic problem that can be solved with the given information.\n</thinking>\n\nTo determine the number of hens, let's first let x represent the number of roosters.\n\nWe're told that the number of hens is 5 less than 9 times the number of roosters. So if there are x roosters, the number of hens is:\n\n9x - 5\n\nNow, the total number of chickens is the sum of the hens and roosters:\n\nHens + Roosters = Total\n(9x - 5) + x = 75\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n10x - 5 = 75\n\nAdd 5 to both sides:\n10x = 80 \n\nDivide both sides by 10:\nx = 8\n\nSo there are 8 roosters. Plugging that back into the expression for the number of hens:\n\nHens = 9(8) - 5\n        = 72 - 5\n        = 67\n\nTherefore, there are 67 hens on the farm.",
