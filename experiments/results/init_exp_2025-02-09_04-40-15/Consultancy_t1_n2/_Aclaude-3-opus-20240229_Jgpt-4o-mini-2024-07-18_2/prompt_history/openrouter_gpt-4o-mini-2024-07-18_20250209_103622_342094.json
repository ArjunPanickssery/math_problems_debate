      "content": "QUESTION: In Sam's first 100 matches he won 50% of matches.  In his next 100 games, he won 60% of matches.  How many total matches did he win?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 110.0\nHe won 100*.5=50 matches in his first 100 games\nIn his next 100 games, he won 100*.6=60 matches\nSo in total, he won 50+60=110 matches\n#### 110\n(A): 120.0\nSam's final win rate was 60%\nThis means across all 200 matches, he won 200 * 0.6 = 120 matches\n#### 120\n## Argument in favour of A\nSam won 60% of his matches in the second 100 games, but that doesn't mean his overall win rate across all 200 matches was 60%. To calculate his total wins, we need to add the wins from each set of 100 matches separately. He won 50 matches in the first 100 games (50% win rate) and 60 matches in the next 100 games (60% win rate). So in total, he won 50 + 60 = 110 matches out of the 200 played. The 60% win rate only applies to the second set of 100 matches, not his overall performance.\n"
