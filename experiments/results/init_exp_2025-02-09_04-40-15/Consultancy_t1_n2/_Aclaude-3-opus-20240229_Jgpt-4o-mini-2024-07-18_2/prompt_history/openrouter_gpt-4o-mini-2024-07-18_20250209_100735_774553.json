      "content": "QUESTION: In 2010 the Chicago Bulls won 70 games. The Miami Heat won 5 more games than the Chicago Bulls.  How many games did the Bulls and the Heat win together?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 145.0\nThe Heat won 5 more games than the Bulls so they won 70 + 5 = 75 games.\nThe total games won together is 70+75 = 145 games.\n#### 145\n(B): 150.0\nThe Heat won 5 more games than the Bulls (70).\nSo the Heat won 75 games.\nThe total games between them would be 70 + 75 + 5 = 150 games.\n#### 150\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe Bulls won 70 games, and the Heat won 5 more than the Bulls, which means the Heat won 75 games. To find the total games won by both teams, we simply add their individual wins: 70 + 75 = 145. There's no need to add the extra 5 games again, as that would be double counting the Heat's additional wins over the Bulls. The question asks for the total games won by both teams together, and 145 is the correct sum of their respective win totals.\n"
