      "content": "QUESTION: A housewife goes to the market. She spent 2/3 of her $150. How much does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50\n(A): 100.0\nFirst calculate what fraction remains: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\nSince 2/3 was spent, multiply $150 by 2/3: $150 * (2/3) = $100\nThis is the amount she has left.\n#### 100\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe housewife started with $150 and spent 2/3 of it. To find out how much she has left, we need to calculate what fraction of the original amount remains. \n\nWe know that the whole is 3/3. She spent 2/3. So the remaining fraction is:\n\n3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\n\nThis means she has 1/3 of the original $150 left. \n\nTo calculate 1/3 of $150, we multiply:\n\n$150 * (1/3) = $50\n\nTherefore, the housewife has $50 left after her shopping trip. The correct answer is (B) $50.\n"
