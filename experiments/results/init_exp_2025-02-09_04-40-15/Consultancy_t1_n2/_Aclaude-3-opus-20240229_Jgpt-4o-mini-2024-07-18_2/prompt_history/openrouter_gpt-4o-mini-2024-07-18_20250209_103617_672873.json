      "content": "QUESTION: Darla has 6 books in her locker.  Katie has half as many books as Darla, and Gary has 5 times the number of books that Darla and Katie have combined.  How many books do the three have total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 54.0\nDarla:6 books\nKatie:6/2=3 books\nGary: 5(6+3)=45 books\n6+3+45=54 books\n#### 54\n(B): 108.0\nDarla: 6 books\nKatie: 12 books\nGary: 5(6+12) = 90 books\n6+12+90 = 108 books\n#### 108\n## Argument in favour of A\nDarla has 6 books, and Katie has half as many, which is 3 books. Together, Darla and Katie have 6 + 3 = 9 books. Gary has 5 times the number of books that Darla and Katie have combined, so Gary has 5 * 9 = 45 books. In total, Darla, Katie, and Gary have 6 + 3 + 45 = 54 books. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 54 books.\n"
