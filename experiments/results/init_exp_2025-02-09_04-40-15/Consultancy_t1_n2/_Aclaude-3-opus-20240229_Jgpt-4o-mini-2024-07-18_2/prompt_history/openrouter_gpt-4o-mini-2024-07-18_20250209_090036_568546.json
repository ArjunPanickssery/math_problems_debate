      "content": "QUESTION: A cat has nine lives.  A dog has 3 less lives than a cat.  A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog.  How many lives does a mouse have?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 13.0\nDog:9-3=6 lives\nMouse:6+7=13 lives\n#### 13\n(A): 19.0\nCat has 9 lives\nDog has 3 more than cat: 9 + 3 = 12 lives\nMouse has 7 more than dog: 12 + 7 = 19 lives\n#### 19\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe question states that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat, not 3 more. Since a cat has 9 lives, a dog would have 9 - 3 = 6 lives. The question then says a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. With a dog having 6 lives, a mouse would have 6 + 7 = 13 lives. Therefore, the correct answer is that a mouse has 13 lives, not 19.\n"
