      "content": "QUESTION: James buys twice as many toy soldiers as toy cars.  He buys 20 toy cars.  How many total toys does he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nHe buys 2*20=40 toy cars\nSo the total number of toys is 20+40=60\n#### 60\n(A): 40.0\nHe buys twice as many toy soldiers as cars\nThis means he buys 2*20=40 toy soldiers\nThis is the total number of toys\n#### 40\n## Argument in favour of B\nJames buys 20 toy cars and twice as many toy soldiers. Since he buys twice as many soldiers as cars, the number of soldiers is 2 * 20 = 40. To find the total number of toys, we add the number of cars and soldiers together: 20 cars + 40 soldiers = 60 total toys. Therefore, the correct answer is that James buys a total of 60 toys.\n"
