      "content": "QUESTION: Twenty gallons of tea were poured into 80 containers. Geraldo drank 3.5 containers. How many pints of tea did Geraldo drink?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 7.0\n20 gallons = 160 pints\n160/80 = 2 pints\n3.5 * 2 pints = 7 pints\nGeraldo drank 7 pints of tea.\n#### 7\n(B): 5.25\n20 gallons = 120 pints\n120/80 = 1.5 pints\n3.5 * 1.5 pints = 5.25 pints\nGeraldo drank 5.25 pints of tea.\n#### 5.25\n## Argument in favour of B\n20 gallons equals 160 pints, and there are 80 containers total. This means each container holds 160/80 = 2 pints of tea. Since Geraldo drank 3.5 containers, he consumed 3.5 * 2 = 7 pints of tea. Therefore, the correct answer is (A): 7 pints. The calculation in (B) incorrectly assumes 20 gallons is equivalent to 120 pints, when in fact 1 gallon equals 8 pints, so 20 gallons is 160 pints.\n"
