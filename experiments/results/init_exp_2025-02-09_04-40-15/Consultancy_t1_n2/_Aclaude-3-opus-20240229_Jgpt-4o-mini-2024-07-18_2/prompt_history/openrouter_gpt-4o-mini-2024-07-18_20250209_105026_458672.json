      "content": "QUESTION: Tom needs to lower a rope down 6 stories.   One story is 10 feet.  The only rope being sold is 20 feet long but you lose 25% when lashing them together.  How many pieces of rope will he need to buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet\nHe loses 20*.25=5 feet each time\nSo he gets 20-5=15 feet from each piece\nThat means he needs 60/15=4 pieces of rope\n#### 4\n(A): 3.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet of rope total\nEach piece of rope is 20 feet\nTherefore he needs 60/20=3 pieces of rope\n#### 3\n## Argument in favour of B\nYou lose 25% of the length of each rope when lashing them together. So for each 20 foot rope, you only get 15 usable feet after accounting for the lashing. Since Tom needs to lower the rope down 60 feet (6 stories at 10 feet each), and each rope effectively provides 15 feet, he will need 60/15 = 4 ropes to cover the total distance. The 25% loss per rope is critical here - without accounting for that, 3 ropes would suffice, but because of the lashing losses, 4 ropes are actually needed.\n"
