      "content": "QUESTION: There are 14 red crayons, 5 more blue crayons than red crayons, and 6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons.  How many yellow crayons are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 32.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:5+14=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)-6=32 crayons\n#### 32\n(A): 44.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:14+5=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)+6=44 crayons\n#### 44\n## Argument in favour of B\nThere are 14 red crayons and 5 more blue crayons than red, so there are 19 blue crayons (14 + 5 = 19). The question states there are 6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons. Double the blue crayons is 19 * 2 = 38. Since there are 6 less yellow crayons than that, we subtract 6 from 38 to get the number of yellow crayons: 38 - 6 = 32. Therefore, the correct answer is that there are 32 yellow crayons.\n"
