      "content": "QUESTION: James buys twice as many toy soldiers as toy cars.  He buys 20 toy cars.  How many total toys does he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nHe buys 2*20=40 toy cars\nSo the total number of toys is 20+40=60\n#### 60\n(A): 40.0\nHe buys twice as many toy soldiers as cars\nThis means he buys 2*20=40 toy soldiers\nThis is the total number of toys\n#### 40\n## Argument in favour of A\nJames buys 20 toy cars and twice as many toy soldiers. Since he buys twice the number of toy soldiers as cars, and he bought 20 cars, that means he bought 40 toy soldiers. The total number of toys is the sum of the cars and soldiers, which is 20 cars + 40 soldiers = 60 toys total. Therefore, the correct answer is that James bought a total of 60 toys.\n"
