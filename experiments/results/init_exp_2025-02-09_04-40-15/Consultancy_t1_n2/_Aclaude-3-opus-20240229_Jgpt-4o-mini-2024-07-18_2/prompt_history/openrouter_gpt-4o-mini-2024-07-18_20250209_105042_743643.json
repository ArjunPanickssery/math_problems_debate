      "content": "QUESTION: John starts climbing a very steep hill.  He travels 1 foot vertically for every two feet horizontally.  His elevation increases from 100 feet to 1450 feet.  How far does he move horizontally, in feet?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2700.0\nHe travels 1450-100=1350 feet vertically\nSo he travels 1350*2=2700 feet horizontally\n#### 2700\n(B): 2900.0\nHe reaches an elevation of 1450 feet\nSince he moves 2 feet horizontally for each vertical foot, he travels 1450*2=2900 feet horizontally\n#### 2900\n## Argument in favour of B\nJohn reaches an elevation of 1450 feet. Since he moves 2 feet horizontally for every 1 foot vertically, his total horizontal distance is 1450 * 2 = 2900 feet. The fact that he started at an elevation of 100 feet is irrelevant; what matters is the final elevation he reaches. If he climbed to 1450 feet, moving 2 feet horizontally per 1 foot vertically, then he must have traveled 2900 feet horizontally in total to reach that elevation.\n"
