      "content": "QUESTION: It takes 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit. If Lydia planted a tree when she was 4 years old and is now 9 years old, how old would she be when she gets to eat an apple from her tree for the first time?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 11.0\nThe tree has been planted for 9 - 4 = 5 years\nIt will take another 7 - 5 = 2 years for it to bear fruit\nLydia will be 9 + 2 = 11 years old\n#### 11\n(B): 16.0\nStarting from her current age of 9\nIt takes 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit\nHer age will be 9 + 7 = 16 when she can eat the apples\n#### 16\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe answer is clearly 11 years old. Since Lydia planted the tree at age 4 and is now 9, the tree has already been growing for 5 years. Apple trees take 7 years to bear fruit, so we only need to wait for the remaining 2 years (7 - 5 = 2). Adding these 2 years to Lydia's current age of 9 gives us 11 years old. This approach correctly accounts for the time that has already passed since planting, rather than incorrectly starting the 7-year count from her current age.\n"
