      "content": "QUESTION: Kylie and Kayla pick apples together and take home 340 apples total. If Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked, how many apples did Kayla pick?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 274.0\nLet x be the number of apples Kylie picked\nKayla picked 10+4x apples\n340=x+(10+4x)\n340=5x+10\n330=5x\nx=66 apples\nKayla picked 10+4(66)=274 apples\n#### 274\n(B): 280\nLet x be the number of apples Kylie picked\nKayla picked 4(x+10) apples\n340=x+4(x+10)\n340=x+4x+40\n340=5x+40\n300=5x\nx=60 apples\nKayla picked 4(60+10)=4(70)=280 apples\n#### 280\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct interpretation is that Kayla picked \"10 more than 4 times\" Kylie's amount, which algebraically translates to 10+4x, not 4(x+10). This is because the phrase \"10 more than\" indicates addition after multiplication, not before. Let me demonstrate with numbers:\n\nIf Kylie picked 66 apples:\n1. First, multiply by 4: 4 \u00d7 66 = 264\n2. Then add 10: 264 + 10 = 274\n\nThis gives us 274 apples for Kayla, and when we add Kylie's 66 apples, we get our total of 340 apples. The alternative interpretation would incorrectly distribute the \"10 more than\" inside the multiplication.\n"

          "content": "What is the correct interpretation of the phrase \"10 more than 4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked\"? Does it mean to add 10 after multiplying Kylie's amount by 4, or to add 10 to Kylie's amount before multiplying by 4? \n\nCan you clarify if the equation should be set up as Kayla's apples being 10 + 4x or as 4(x + 10)? \n\nWhich method of solving the equation is more commonly accepted in mathematical practice for this type of word problem? \n\nIs there any ambiguity in the wording that could lead to different interpretations? \n\nCan you provide examples of similar problems and how they were interpreted? \n\nWhat is the general consensus among mathematicians or educators regarding this type of phrasing?",
