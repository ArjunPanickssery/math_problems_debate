          "content": "Let me argue for answer A (20,000 bags). The calculation needs to account for all variables: bags per trip, trips per day, and total days. Each trip allows 10 bags, and with 20 trips daily, that's 200 bags per trip. However, we must multiply this by both the number of trips (20) and days (5) to capture the full delivery capacity. This gives us 200 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 5 = 20,000 bags. This larger number makes more sense for a professional delivery service operating over nearly a week, as grocery stores handle massive volumes of orders daily.",
