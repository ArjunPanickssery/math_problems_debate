          "content": "Let me argue for why 54 is the correct answer. The problem states Katie has \"half as many books as Darla.\" Since Darla has 6 books, Katie must have 3 books (6 \u00f7 2 = 3). This is crucial because the alternative interpretation suggesting Katie has 12 books would mean she has twice as many, not half as many. For Gary's books, we multiply the sum of Darla and Katie's books (6 + 3 = 9) by 5, giving us 45 books. Adding all three together (6 + 3 + 45) gives us 54 books total.",
