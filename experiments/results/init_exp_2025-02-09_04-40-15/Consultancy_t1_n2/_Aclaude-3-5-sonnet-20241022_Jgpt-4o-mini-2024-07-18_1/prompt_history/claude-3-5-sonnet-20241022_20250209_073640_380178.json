          "content": "Let me argue for why 16 envelopes is the correct answer.\n\nThe key phrase \"4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue envelopes\" means we need to subtract 4 from the number of blue envelopes to find the yellow ones. Since Wyatt has 10 blue envelopes, he must have 10 - 4 = 6 yellow envelopes. This makes logical sense because having \"fewer\" means a smaller number, not more.\n\nTo find the total, we simply add the blue and yellow envelopes: 10 blue + 6 yellow = 16 envelopes total. Let me know if you'd like me to clarify any part of this reasoning.",
