      "content": "QUESTION: Maddy is in college for 8 semesters. She needs 120 credits to graduate. If each class is 3 credits, how many classes does she need to take per semester?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 5.0\n120 credits / 3 credits is 40.\n40 credits/ 8 semester = 5 classes per semester.\nMaddy needs to take 5 classes per semester\n#### 5\n(B): 15\nStarting with 120 total credits required\nDividing by 8 semesters gives us 15 credits per semester\nConverting to classes by dividing these semester credits by 3 credits per class\nThis means 15 classes per semester are needed\n#### 15\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me argue for why 5 classes per semester is the correct answer.\n\nTo graduate, Maddy needs 120 total credits. Since each class is worth 3 credits, we can calculate the total number of classes needed by dividing 120 by 3, which gives us 40 total classes. Spreading these 40 classes across 8 semesters means taking 5 classes per semester (40 \u00f7 8 = 5).\n\nThis answer is also practical and realistic. Most college students typically take 4-6 classes per semester, making 5 classes a standard course load. Taking 15 classes per semester would be impossible - there aren't enough hours in the day to attend that many classes!\n\nWould you like me to clarify any part of this reasoning?\n"
