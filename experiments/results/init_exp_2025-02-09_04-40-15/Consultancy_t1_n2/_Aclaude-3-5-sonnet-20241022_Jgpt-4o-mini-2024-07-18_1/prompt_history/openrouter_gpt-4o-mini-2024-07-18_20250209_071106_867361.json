      "content": "QUESTION: John buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students.  He has 6 classes and 30 students in each class.  How many packs did he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 360.0\nJohn has 6*30=180 students\nSo he bought 180*2=360 packs\n#### 360\n(A): 12.0\nCalculate number of classes: 6\nMultiply by 2 packs per class: 6*2=12\n#### 12\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe answer is clearly 360 packs. Let's break this down logically: John has 6 classes with 30 students each, which means he has a total of 180 students (6 \u00d7 30 = 180). Since each student needs 2 packs of index cards, we multiply 180 students by 2 packs per student, giving us 360 packs total (180 \u00d7 2 = 360). The question states John buys packs \"for all his students,\" not per class, so we must consider the total number of students.\n"
