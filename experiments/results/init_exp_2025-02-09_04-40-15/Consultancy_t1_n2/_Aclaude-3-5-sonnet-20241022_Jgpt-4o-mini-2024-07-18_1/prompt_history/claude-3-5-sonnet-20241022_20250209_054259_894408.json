          "content": "The answer is clearly 67 hens. The phrase \"5 less than 9 times\" mathematically translates to \"9x - 5\" where x is the number of roosters. This is because when we say \"less than,\" we subtract. If we used \"9x + 5,\" it would mean \"5 more than 9 times,\" which contradicts the problem statement. With 8 roosters and 67 hens, we get a total of 75 chickens (8 + 67 = 75), perfectly satisfying both conditions of the problem.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about this reasoning.",
