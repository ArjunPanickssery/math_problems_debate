          "content": "The key to solving this problem lies in correctly interpreting \"10 more than 4 times the amount.\" This should be written as 4(x+10), not 10+4x, because the \"4 times\" applies to both Kylie's amount and the additional 10 apples. Let me demonstrate with the tool:\n\n```python\nx = 60  # Kylie's apples\nkayla = 4 * (x + 10)  # Kayla's apples\ntotal = x + kayla\nprint(f\"Kylie: {x}\")\nprint(f\"Kayla: {kayla}\")\nprint(f\"Total: {total}\")\n```\n\nThis shows that when Kylie picks 60 apples, Kayla picks 280 apples (4 times [60+10]), and their total is indeed 340 apples. The alternative solution misinterprets the order of operations in the word problem.",
