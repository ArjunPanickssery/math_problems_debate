          "content": "The answer is clearly $2,250. When we say something costs \"1/10 as much,\" we're actually talking about a reduction in price. Think about it: if something costs \"half as much,\" it means you're paying less, not more. Therefore, when calculating the barbell at 1/10 the price of the squat rack ($250), we need to subtract this difference from the original price ($2,500), giving us $2,250. This interpretation aligns with common pricing language where \"as much\" implies a reduction rather than an addition.",
