      "content": "QUESTION: Jame gets a raise to $20 per hour and works 40 hours a week.  His old job was $16 an hour for 25 hours per week.  How much more money does he make per year in his new job than the old job if he works 52 weeks a year?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 20800.0\nHe makes 20*40=$800 per week\nHe used to make 16*25=$400 per week\nSo his raise was 800-400=$400 per week\nSo he makes 400*52=$20,800 per year more\n#### 20800\n(A): 8320\nLet's find the difference in pay rate: 20-16 = 4\nMultiply by hours worked: 4*40 = 160\nMultiply by weeks per year: 160*52 = 8320\n#### 8320\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe calculation method in answer A is the most accurate way to determine Jame's additional yearly earnings. By focusing on the difference in hourly rate ($4) and applying it to his new work hours (40), we get the true incremental earnings per week ($160). This approach isolates the actual raise amount without being confused by the change in hours worked. The final step of multiplying by 52 weeks gives us $8,320, which represents the pure increase in earnings due to the higher pay rate.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about this logical approach to calculating the raise's impact.\n"
