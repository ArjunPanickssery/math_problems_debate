          "content": "Let me explain why 17 feet is the correct answer. When calculating growth over time, we need to consider the compounding effect. Each month, John grew 2 inches from his new height. Starting at 66 inches, after one month he was 68 inches, then we multiply by 3 for the three months of consistent growth, giving us 204 inches. This multiplication accounts for the sustained growth rate over the period. Converting to feet by dividing by 12 inches per foot gives us 17 feet. Let me calculate this: 204/12 = 17.0 feet.",
