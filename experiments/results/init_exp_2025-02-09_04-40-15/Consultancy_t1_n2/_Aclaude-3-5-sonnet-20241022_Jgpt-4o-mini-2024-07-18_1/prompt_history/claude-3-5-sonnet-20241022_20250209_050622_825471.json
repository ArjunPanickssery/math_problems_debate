          "content": "Let me argue for why 97 is the correct answer. When we say there are \"seven fewer noodles than pirates,\" we need to add 7 to the number of noodles to equal the number of pirates. Since there are 45 pirates, we can write this as: noodles + 7 = 45. Therefore, the number of noodles must be 52 (45 + 7). To find the total number of noodles and pirates, we add 52 noodles + 45 pirates = 97 total. This aligns with the mathematical principle that when comparing quantities, \"fewer than\" means we need to add to the smaller number to reach the larger number.",
