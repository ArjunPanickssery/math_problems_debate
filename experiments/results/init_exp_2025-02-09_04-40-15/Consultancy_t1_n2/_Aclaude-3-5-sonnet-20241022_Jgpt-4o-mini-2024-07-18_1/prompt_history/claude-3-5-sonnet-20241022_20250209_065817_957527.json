          "content": "The answer is clearly 80 tickets per day. Here's why: First, we need to find the total number of tickets sold across all three days. Since the total revenue is $960 and each ticket costs $4, we divide $960 by $4 to get 240 total tickets. Then, to find the daily average, we simply divide 240 tickets by 3 days, giving us 80 tickets per day.\n\nThe alternative approach of dividing money first ($960/3) and then multiplying by ticket price ($320\u00d74) is mathematically incorrect because it double-counts the ticket price, leading to an inflated result of 1280 tickets, which doesn't make sense given the total revenue.",
