          "content": "Let me explain why answer (A) is correct. The problem states that Emily's hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's hair. Since Logan's hair is 20 inches, we need to add 6 inches to get Emily's hair length: 20 + 6 = 26 inches. Then, since Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's, we divide Emily's hair length by 2: 26 \u00f7 2 = 13 inches. This follows the logical sequence of first finding Emily's hair length by adding, then determining Kate's hair length through division.",
