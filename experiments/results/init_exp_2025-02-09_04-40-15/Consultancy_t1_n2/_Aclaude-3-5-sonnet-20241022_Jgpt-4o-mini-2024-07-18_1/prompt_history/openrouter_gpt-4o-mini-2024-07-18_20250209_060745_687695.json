      "content": "QUESTION: Oli's banana split has 4 scoops of ice cream while Victoria has twice more scoops of ice cream than Oli's. How many more scoops of ice cream does Victoria have than Oli?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nVictoria has 4 x 2 = 8 scoops of ice cream.\nTherefore, Victoria has 8 - 4 = 4 more scoops of ice cream than Oli.\n#### 4\n(A): 8.0\nVictoria's scoops can be calculated as 4 + (2 \u00d7 4) = 4 + 8 = 12 scoops of ice cream.\nTherefore, Victoria has 12 - 4 = 8 more scoops than Oli.\n#### 8\n## Argument in favour of B\nLet me argue for why the answer is 4 scoops. The problem states that Victoria has \"twice more\" scoops than Oli, which means we should multiply Oli's 4 scoops by 2. This gives Victoria 8 scoops total. To find how many more scoops Victoria has, we subtract Oli's scoops from Victoria's: 8 - 4 = 4 scoops. The phrase \"twice more\" is a straightforward multiplier, not an addition followed by multiplication as suggested in answer A. This simpler interpretation aligns with common mathematical language and yields 4 as the correct difference in scoops.\n"
