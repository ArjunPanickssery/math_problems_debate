          "content": "Let me argue for answer (A). When calculating daily ticket sales, we need to first determine Carol's daily revenue. Since she made $960 over three days, dividing $960 by 3 gives us $320 per day. Now, since each ticket costs $4, we multiply the daily revenue ($320) by 4 to get the number of tickets sold per day. This multiplication is necessary because we're converting from dollars to tickets, and more tickets are sold than the dollar amount suggests. Therefore, 320 \u00d7 4 = 1280 tickets per day is the correct average.",
