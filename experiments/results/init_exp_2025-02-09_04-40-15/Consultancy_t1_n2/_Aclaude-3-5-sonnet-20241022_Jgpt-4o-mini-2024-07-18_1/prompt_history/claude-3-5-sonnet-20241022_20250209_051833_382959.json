With two trips per month, she spends 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 hours driving monthly. Multiplying by 12 months gives us 72 hours annually. The key phrase \"to town and back\" indicates that 3 hours covers both directions, not just one way. This interpretation aligns with common language usage, where stating a journey time typically refers to the complete round trip.",
