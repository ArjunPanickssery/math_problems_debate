Let's break this down:\n\nFor rawhide bones:\n- 2 bones per day at $1 each\n- Daily cost: 2 \u00d7 $1 = $2\n- Weekly cost: $2 \u00d7 7 = $14\n\nFor dog biscuits:\n- 4 biscuits per day at $0.25 each\n- Daily cost: 4 \u00d7 $0.25 = $1\n- Weekly cost: $1 \u00d7 7 = $7\n\nTotal weekly cost: $14 + $7 = $21\n\nThe other answer incorrectly swapped the quantities (4 bones and 2 biscuits), leading to a wrong calculation.",
