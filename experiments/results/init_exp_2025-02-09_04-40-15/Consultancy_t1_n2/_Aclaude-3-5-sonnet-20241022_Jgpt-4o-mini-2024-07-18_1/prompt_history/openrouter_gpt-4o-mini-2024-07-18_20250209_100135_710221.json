      "content": "QUESTION: Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, while her sister has two more dolls than their grandmother. If their grandmother has 50 dolls, how many dolls do they have altogether?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 258.0\nIf the grandmother has 50 dolls, Rene's sister, who has 2 more dolls than their grandmother, has 50+2 = 52 dolls.\nTogether, Rene's sister and the grandmother have 52+50 = 102 dolls.\nSince Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, she has 52*3 = 156 dolls.\nAltogether, they have 156+102 = 258 dolls.\n#### 258\n(B): 658.0\nStarting with grandmother's 50 dolls, we first multiply by 3 to get 150.\nAdding 2 gives us the sister's number of dolls: 152.\nSince Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, she has 152*3 = 456 dolls.\nThe total number of dolls is therefore 50+152+456 = 658.\n#### 658\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me argue for why 258 is the correct answer.\n\nThe problem requires careful sequential calculation. First, we establish the grandmother has 50 dolls. The sister's dolls are directly related to grandmother's count (2 more), so we calculate 50 + 2 = 52 dolls for the sister. Then, Rene's dolls are based on her sister's count (three times as many), so that's 52 \u00d7 3 = 156 dolls. Adding all three (50 + 52 + 156) gives us 258 dolls total.\n\nThe alternative answer of 658 incorrectly applies the \"three times\" relationship to the grandmother's dolls first, which violates the given relationships in the problem. The correct sequence must start with the sister's relationship to grandmother, then Rene's to her sister.\n"
