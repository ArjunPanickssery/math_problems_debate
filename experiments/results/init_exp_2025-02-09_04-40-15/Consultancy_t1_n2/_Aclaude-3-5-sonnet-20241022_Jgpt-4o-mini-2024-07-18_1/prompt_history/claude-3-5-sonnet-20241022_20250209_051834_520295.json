          "content": "The calculation is straightforward and logical. A cat having nine lives is a well-known saying, and the dog has 3 less lives than a cat, which means we subtract: 9 - 3 = 6 lives for the dog. Then, since a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog, we add: 6 + 7 = 13 lives for the mouse. The key is understanding that \"less\" means subtraction, while \"more\" means addition. This follows the natural order of operations and maintains consistency in the mathematical relationships between the animals.",
