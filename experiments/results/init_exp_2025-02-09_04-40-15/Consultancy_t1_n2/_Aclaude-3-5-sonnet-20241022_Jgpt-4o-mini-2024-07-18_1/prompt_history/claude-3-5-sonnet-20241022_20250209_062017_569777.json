Spends half on book: $102 \u00f7 2 = $51 remaining\n\nThis perfectly matches the final amount given in the question. If we started with $408, Isabel would have $204 after the toy purchase, and $102 after the book purchase, which doesn't match the $51 remaining stated in the problem. Therefore, $204 must be the initial amount.",
