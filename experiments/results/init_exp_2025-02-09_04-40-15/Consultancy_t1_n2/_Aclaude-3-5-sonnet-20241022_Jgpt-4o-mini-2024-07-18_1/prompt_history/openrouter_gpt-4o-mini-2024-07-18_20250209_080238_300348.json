      "content": "QUESTION: Brianne saves $10 in January. Each month, she saves twice as much as her previous month's savings. How much will she save in May?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 160.0\nBrianne saves $10 x 2 = $20 in February.\nShe will save $20 x 2 = $40 in March.\nShe will save $40 x 2 = $80 in April.\nTherefore, she will save $80 x 2 = $160 in May.\n#### 160\n(A): 810.0\nStarting with $10 in January\nFor February: $10 becomes $30\nFor March: $30 becomes $90\nFor April: $90 becomes $270\nFor May: $270 becomes $810\n#### 810\n## Argument in favour of B\nLet me argue for why $160 is the correct answer. The question clearly states that \"each month, she saves twice as much as her previous month's savings.\" This means we multiply the previous month's amount by 2. Starting with $10 in January:\n\nFebruary: $10 \u00d7 2 = $20\nMarch: $20 \u00d7 2 = $40\nApril: $40 \u00d7 2 = $80\nMay: $80 \u00d7 2 = $160\n\nThis follows a clear doubling pattern (\u00d72) each month, which is exactly what the question asks for. The other answer incorrectly adds the previous amount instead of just doubling it.\n"
