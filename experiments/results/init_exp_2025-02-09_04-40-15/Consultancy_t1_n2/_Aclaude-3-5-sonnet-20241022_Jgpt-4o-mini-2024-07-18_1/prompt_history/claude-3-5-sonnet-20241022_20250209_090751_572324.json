          "content": "The key phrase \"9 fewer orange marbles than pink marbles\" clearly indicates subtraction, not addition. If Katie has 13 pink marbles and 9 fewer orange marbles, she must have 4 orange marbles (13 - 9 = 4). This is a crucial distinction that answer A misinterprets. Following the problem's logic, she then has 4 times as many purple marbles as orange marbles, so that's 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 purple marbles. Adding all marbles (13 pink + 4 orange + 16 purple) equals 33 marbles total.",
