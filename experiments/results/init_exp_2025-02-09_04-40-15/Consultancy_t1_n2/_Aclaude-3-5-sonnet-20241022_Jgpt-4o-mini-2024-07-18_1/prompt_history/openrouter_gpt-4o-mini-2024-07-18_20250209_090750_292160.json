      "content": "QUESTION: Tim has some cans of soda. Jeff comes by, and takes 6 cans of soda from Tim. Tim then goes and buys another half the amount of soda cans he had left. If Tim has 24 cans of soda in the end, how many cans of soda did Tim have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 22.0\nLet x be the number of cans Tim has at first.\nAfter Jeff comes by, Tim has x-6 cans left.\nTim buys another (x-6)/2 cans.\nx-6+(x-6)/2=24\n2*x-12+x-6=48\n3*x-18=48\n3*x=66\nx=22\n#### 22\n(A): 20.0\nx - 6 + x/2 = 24\n2x - 12 + x = 48\n3x = 60\nx = 20\n#### 20\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe answer is clearly 22 cans. Let me walk you through the logic. When Tim buys \"half the amount of soda cans he had left,\" this means we need to take half of (x-6), not half of x. This is crucial because Tim's purchase is based on what remained after Jeff took 6 cans. Let's verify: Starting with 22 cans, Jeff takes 6, leaving 16 cans. Tim then buys half of 16 (which is 8 more cans). 16 + 8 = 24 cans, exactly matching our final condition. Answer A incorrectly calculates the halfway point, leading to an incorrect result.\n"
