      "content": "QUESTION: John eats a bag of chips for dinner and then eats twice as many after dinner.  How many bags of chips did he eat?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 3.0\nHe ate 2 * 1 = 2 bags after dinner\nSo he ate 2 + 1 = 3 bags of chips\n#### 3\n(A): 2.0\nHe ate 1 bag for dinner\nApply the doubling: 1 * 2 = 2 bags in total\n#### 2\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe question states John ate \"twice as many after dinner,\" which means the doubling applies to the total count, not as additional bags. If he ate one bag for dinner, then doubling that amount gives us 1 * 2 = 2 bags total. This interpretation aligns with common language usage where \"twice as many\" typically refers to the final total, not an additional amount. Think of it like doubling your money - if you have $1 and double it, you end up with $2 total, not $3.\n"
