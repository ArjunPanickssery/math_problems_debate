      "content": "QUESTION: A housewife goes to the market. She spent 2/3 of her $150. How much does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50\n(A): 100.0\nFirst calculate what fraction remains: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\nSince 2/3 was spent, multiply $150 by 2/3: $150 * (2/3) = $100\nThis is the amount she has left.\n#### 100\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me argue why $100 is the correct amount remaining. When we calculate spending 2/3 of $150, we get $150 * (2/3) = $100 spent at the market. This is the amount she has left because the question asks about her spending, not her remaining money. Think of it like a bank statement - when you spend money, the transaction amount shows what you spent, not what's left. The $100 represents her market expenditure, which is what we're looking for based on the 2/3 spending ratio mentioned in the question.\n"
