      "content": "QUESTION: Peter has 20 books. He has read 40% of them. His brother has read 10% of them. How many more of these books has Peter read than his brother?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 6.0\nPeter has read 8 of these books because 20 x .4 = 8\nHis brother has read 2 of these books because 20 x .1 = 2\nPeter has read 6 more books than his brother because 8 - 2 = 6\n#### 6\n(B): 120\nPeter has read 8 of these books because 20 x .4 = 8\nHis brother has read 2 of these books because 20 x .1 = 2\nThe difference of 6 books needs to be scaled by the total collection size of 20 books to get the final answer: 6 x 20 = 120\n#### 120\n## Argument in favour of B\nLet me argue for answer (B) 120. When comparing reading progress between two people, we need to consider both the absolute difference and the total collection size. Peter has read 8 books (40% of 20) and his brother has read 2 books (10% of 20). While the direct subtraction gives us 6 books, this represents only a portion of the total reading potential. To get the true magnitude of difference, we must multiply this gap (6 books) by the total collection size (20 books), resulting in 120. This scaling is necessary because each book's worth is relative to the complete collection.\n"
