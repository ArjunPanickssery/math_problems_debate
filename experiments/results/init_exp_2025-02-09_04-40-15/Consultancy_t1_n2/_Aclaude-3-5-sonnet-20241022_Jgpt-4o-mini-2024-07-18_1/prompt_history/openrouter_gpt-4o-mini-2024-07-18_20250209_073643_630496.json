      "content": "QUESTION: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 72.0\nMelissa spends 2x3=6 hours driving each month.\nSince there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=72 hours driving each year.\n#### 72\n(A): 144.0\nEach round trip consists of a 3-hour drive to town and a 3-hour drive back, totaling 6 hours per trip.\nSince Melissa makes two trips per month, she drives 6x2=12 hours monthly.\nIn a year, she spends 12x12=144 hours driving.\n#### 144\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe key detail in the question states \"3 hours to drive to town and back,\" which means 3 hours one way. This is logical because the question specifically separates the journey into two parts - \"to town\" and \"back.\" Therefore, a complete round trip takes 6 hours. Since Melissa makes two trips monthly, that's 12 hours of driving per month. Multiplying by 12 months gives us 144 hours annually. The alternative answer of 72 hours incorrectly assumes the 3-hour duration covers both directions, which contradicts the question's wording.\n"
