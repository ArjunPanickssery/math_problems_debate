          "content": "Let me argue for answer (B) 56 crayons being slightly used.\n\nThe calculation should be done by considering the total box first. With 120 crayons total, we know one-third are new, which is 40 crayons. Then, 20% of the TOTAL box is broken, not 20% of what's left after removing new ones. This means 24 crayons are broken (120 \u00d7 0.20 = 24). Therefore, the slightly used crayons are what remain after subtracting both new and broken from the total: 120 - 40 - 24 = 56 crayons.\n\nThe other approach incorrectly applies the 20% to the remaining crayons after removing new ones, which doesn't match the question's wording about 20% of crayons being broken.",
