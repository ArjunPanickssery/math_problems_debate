      "content": "QUESTION: A certain kind of wild mushroom has either spots or gills, but never both. Gilled mushrooms are rare, with only one growing for every nine spotted mushrooms that grow. A fallen log had 30 mushrooms growing on its side. How many gilled mushrooms were on the fallen log\u2019s side?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 3.0\nThere is 1 gilled mushroom for every 1 + 9 = 10 mushrooms.\nThus, there were 30 / 10 = 3 gilled mushrooms on the fallen log\u2019s side.\n#### 3\n(A): 27\nFor every 9 spotted mushrooms, we have 1 gilled mushroom.\nThis means that out of every 10 mushrooms, 9 must be gilled.\nTherefore, 9/10 of the total mushrooms are gilled.\n9/10 of 30 = 27 gilled mushrooms.\n#### 27\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me argue for answer (A): 27 gilled mushrooms.\n\nThe key is in understanding the ratio correctly. When we say \"only one gilled mushroom for every nine spotted mushrooms,\" this means that gilled mushrooms are actually the majority. Think about it: if you have 10 mushrooms total, and only one of them is spotted for every nine gilled ones, then 9 out of 10 must be gilled.\n\nLet me demonstrate with a smaller number. If we had 10 mushrooms total, following this ratio, we would have 9 gilled mushrooms and 1 spotted mushroom. Scaling this up to 30 mushrooms, we multiply both parts by 3: resulting in 27 gilled mushrooms and 3 spotted mushrooms.\n"
