      "content": "QUESTION: In the engineering department, 70% of the students are men and 180 are women. How many men are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 420.0\nThe percentage for women is 100% - 70% = 30%.\nSince 180 represents 30%, then 180/30 = 6 students represent 1%.\nHence, 6 x 70 = 420 students are men.\n#### 420\n(B): 126\nSince 70% of students are men, we can find the number by taking 70% of 180:\n180 \u00d7 0.7 = 126 men in the department.\n#### 126\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me argue for answer (A) 420 men:\n\nThe key is understanding that 180 women represent 30% of the total student population. Using this, we can calculate that each percentage point equals 6 students (180 \u00f7 30 = 6). Since men make up 70% of students, we multiply 6 by 70 to get 420 men. This approach uses the fundamental principle that percentages must total 100%, and if we know both the percentage and actual number for one group, we can calculate the other.\n\nLet me demonstrate with a calculator:\n```python\nwomen = 180\nwomen_percentage = 30\nstudents_per_percentage = women / women_percentage\nmen = students_per_percentage * 70\nprint(men)  # Output: 420.0\n```\n"
