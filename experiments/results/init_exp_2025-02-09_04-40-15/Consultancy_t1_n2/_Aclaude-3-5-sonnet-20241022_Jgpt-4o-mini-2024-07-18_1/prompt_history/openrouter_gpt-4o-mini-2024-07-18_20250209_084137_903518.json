      "content": "QUESTION: Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. If Mabel has 85 marbles, how many more marbles does Mabel have than Amanda?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 63.0\nKatrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles.\nTwice as many marbles as Katrina is 17 x 2 = 34\nAmanda has 34 -12 = 22 marbles.\nMabel has 85 - 22 = 63 more marbles than Amanda\n#### 63\n(B): 39.0\nKatrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles\nAmanda will have 17 \u00d7 2 + 12 = 46 marbles\nMabel has 85 - 46 = 39 more marbles than Amanda\n#### 39\n## Argument in favour of B\nLet me explain why answer (B) 39.0 is correct. Since Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina and Mabel has 85 marbles, we can calculate that Katrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles. Now, Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many as Katrina. This means Amanda currently has (17 \u00d7 2) - 12 = 46 marbles, because if she gets 12 more, she'll have twice Katrina's amount. Therefore, to find how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda, we subtract: 85 - 46 = 39 marbles.\n"
