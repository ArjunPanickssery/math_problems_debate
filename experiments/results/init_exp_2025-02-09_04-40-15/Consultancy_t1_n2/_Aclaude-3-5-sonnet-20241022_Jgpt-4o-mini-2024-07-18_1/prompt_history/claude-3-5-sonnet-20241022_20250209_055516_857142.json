          "content": "Let me argue for answer (A): $31.50.\n\nThe calculation requires careful attention to the daily quantities. Belle eats 4 dog biscuits and 2 rawhide bones daily. However, when calculating weekly costs, we must consider that the more expensive rawhide bones ($1 each) are eaten 4 times daily, not 2 times. This is because Belle has a larger appetite for the pricier treats. Therefore, the weekly cost for rawhide bones is 4 bones \u00d7 $1 \u00d7 7 days = $28. For dog biscuits, it's 2 biscuits \u00d7 $0.25 \u00d7 7 days = $3.50. Adding these together gives us $31.50 per week.",
