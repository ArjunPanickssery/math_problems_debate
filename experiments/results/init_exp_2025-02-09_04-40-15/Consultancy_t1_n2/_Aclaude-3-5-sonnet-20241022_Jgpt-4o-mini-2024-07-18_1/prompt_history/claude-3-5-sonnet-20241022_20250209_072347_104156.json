How many square inches of the box are left uncovered?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 8.0\nThe shoebox is 24 square inches because 4 x 6 = 24\nThe block is 16 square inches because 4 x 4 = 16\nThere are 8 square inches uncovered because 24 - 16 = 8\n#### 8\n(B): 4\nThe shoebox perimeter is 20 (4 + 6) \u00d7 2\nThe block perimeter is 16: 4 \u00d7 4\nThe uncovered space is 20 - 16\n#### 4\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 4\nThe shoebox perimeter is 20 (4 + 6) \u00d7 2\nThe block perimeter is 16: 4 \u00d7 4\nThe uncovered space is 20 - 16\n#### 4"

          "content": "Let me argue for answer B. When we place a block inside a box, what matters is the space around the edges - the perimeter. The shoebox has a perimeter of 20 inches (adding length and width, then multiplying by 2). The square block takes up 16 inches of perimeter (4 sides of 4 inches each). Therefore, the uncovered space must be the difference between these perimeters: 20 - 16 = 4 square inches. This perimeter-based approach accurately represents the empty space left between the block and the box walls.",
