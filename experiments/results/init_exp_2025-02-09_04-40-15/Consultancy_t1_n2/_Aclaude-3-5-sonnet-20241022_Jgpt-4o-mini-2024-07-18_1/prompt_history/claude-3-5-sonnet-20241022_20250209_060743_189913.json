          "content": "Let me argue for why 277 is the correct number of egg-laying hens:\n\nThe calculation is straightforward and logical. First, we know there are 325 total chickens, with 28 roosters. Basic subtraction gives us 325 - 28 = 297 hens in total. Then, we're told that 20 hens don't lay eggs. Therefore, to find egg-laying hens, we subtract these non-laying hens: 297 - 20 = 277 egg-laying hens. Answer A makes the error of adding 20 hens instead of subtracting them, which doesn't make sense since we're removing non-laying hens from the total.",
