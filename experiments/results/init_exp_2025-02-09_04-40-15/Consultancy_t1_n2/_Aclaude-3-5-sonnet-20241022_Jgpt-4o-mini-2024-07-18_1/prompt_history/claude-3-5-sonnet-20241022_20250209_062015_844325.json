          "content": "To find the percentage discount, we must compare how much was saved ($210) to the original price ($350). This follows the standard discount calculation formula: (Amount Saved \u00f7 Original Price) \u00d7 100. When we divide $210 by $350, we get 0.60, which converts to 60%. The other approach incorrectly uses the sale price ($140) as the denominator, which doesn't represent the true percentage off from the original price. Let me demonstrate with a calculator:\n\n```python\nsaved = 350 - 140\npercentage = (saved / 350) * 100\nprint(percentage)  # Output: 60.0\n```",
