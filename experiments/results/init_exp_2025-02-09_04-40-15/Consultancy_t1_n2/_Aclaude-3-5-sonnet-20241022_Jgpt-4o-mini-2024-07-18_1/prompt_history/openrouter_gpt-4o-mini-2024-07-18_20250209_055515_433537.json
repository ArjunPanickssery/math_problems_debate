      "content": "QUESTION: A box of chocolate bars was shared equally between Mike, Rita and Anita. If the box contains 12 bars, how many bars did Mike and Rita get (combined)?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 8.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nMike and Rita together got 4+4 = 8 bars\n#### 8\n(A): 4.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nSince Mike and Rita shared the bars, they got 4 bars together\n#### 4\n## Argument in favour of B\nLet me argue for why 8 bars is the correct answer. When the box of 12 bars was shared equally between Mike, Rita, and Anita, each person received 4 bars (12 \u00f7 3 = 4). Since we're asked about Mike and Rita's bars combined, we need to add their individual portions: Mike's 4 bars plus Rita's 4 bars equals 8 bars total. This is like combining their shares while leaving out Anita's portion. Think of it as two-thirds of the total box, which is 8 bars.\n"
