Therefore, Jason must have 20 necklaces (25 - 5 = 20). Since Josh has half the number of necklaces as Jason, Josh must have 10 necklaces (20 \u00f7 2 = 10). To find how many more necklaces Haley has than Josh, we subtract Josh's necklaces from Haley's: 25 - 10 = 15 necklaces. This logical sequence follows directly from the given information and basic arithmetic operations.",
