If one of his friends wants to buy two dogs, how much should his friend pay?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 2600.0\nMr. Mayer wants to get a $1000 x 30/100 = $300 profit.\nSo, he will sell each Corgi dog for $1000 + $300 = $1300.\nHence, his friend should pay $1300 x 2 = $2600.\n#### 2600\n(A): 3200\nFor this sale of two dogs, we need to consider the total profit percentage.\nBase price for both dogs: $1000 \u00d7 2 = $2000\nSince we're selling two units, the profit needs to be adjusted accordingly: $2000 \u00d7 1.6 = $3200\n#### 3200\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 2600.0\nMr. Mayer wants to get a $1000 x 30/100 = $300 profit.\nSo, he will sell each Corgi dog for $1000 + $300 = $1300.\nHence, his friend should pay $1300 x 2 = $2600.\n#### 2600"

          "content": "Let me argue for $2,600 being the correct answer. The calculation is straightforward and follows basic profit margin principles. For each dog that cost $1,000, Mr. Mayer wants a 30% profit. This means adding $300 (30% of $1,000) to the original price, making each dog's selling price $1,300. Since his friend wants to buy two dogs, we simply multiply $1,300 by 2, arriving at $2,600. This maintains the same profit percentage per unit, which is the standard business practice for retail pricing.\n\nThe alternative calculation of $3,200 incorrectly applies the profit percentage to the total cost of both dogs at once, which would actually result in a 60% profit margin, not the intended 30%. This would be unfair to the customer and deviate from Mr. Mayer's stated profit goal.",
