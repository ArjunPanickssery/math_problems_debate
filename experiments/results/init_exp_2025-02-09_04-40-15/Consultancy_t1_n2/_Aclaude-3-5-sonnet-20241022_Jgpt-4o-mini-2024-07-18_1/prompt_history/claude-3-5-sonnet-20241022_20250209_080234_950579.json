How far does he move horizontally, in feet?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2700.0\nHe travels 1450-100=1350 feet vertically\nSo he travels 1350*2=2700 feet horizontally\n#### 2700\n(B): 2900.0\nHe reaches an elevation of 1450 feet\nSince he moves 2 feet horizontally for each vertical foot, he travels 1450*2=2900 feet horizontally\n#### 2900\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 2700.0\nHe travels 1450-100=1350 feet vertically\nSo he travels 1350*2=2700 feet horizontally\n#### 2700"

          "content": "The correct horizontal distance is 2700 feet. We need to focus on the change in elevation, not the final elevation. John starts at 100 feet and ends at 1450 feet, meaning he climbs 1350 feet vertically (1450 - 100 = 1350). Since he moves 2 feet horizontally for every 1 foot vertically, we multiply 1350 by 2, giving us 2700 feet horizontal distance. Answer B incorrectly uses the final elevation instead of the elevation change, which leads to an overestimation of the distance traveled.",
