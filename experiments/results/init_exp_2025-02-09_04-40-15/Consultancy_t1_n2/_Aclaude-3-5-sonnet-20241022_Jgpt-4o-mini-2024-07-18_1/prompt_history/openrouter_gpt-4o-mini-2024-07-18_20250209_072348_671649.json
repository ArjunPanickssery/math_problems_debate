      "content": "QUESTION: Tara has a shoebox that is 4 inches tall and 6 inches wide. She puts a square block inside that is 4 inches per side. How many square inches of the box are left uncovered?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 8.0\nThe shoebox is 24 square inches because 4 x 6 = 24\nThe block is 16 square inches because 4 x 4 = 16\nThere are 8 square inches uncovered because 24 - 16 = 8\n#### 8\n(B): 4\nThe shoebox perimeter is 20 (4 + 6) \u00d7 2\nThe block perimeter is 16: 4 \u00d7 4\nThe uncovered space is 20 - 16\n#### 4\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me argue for why answer (A) 8.0 is correct.\n\nTo find uncovered area, we need to calculate the total area of the box floor and subtract the area of the square block. The box floor is a rectangle with dimensions 4 inches \u00d7 6 inches, giving us a total area of 24 square inches. The square block has sides of 4 inches, so its area is 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 square inches. When we place this block in the box, it covers 16 square inches, leaving 24 - 16 = 8 square inches uncovered.\n\nAnswer (B) incorrectly uses perimeter instead of area. Perimeter measures the distance around shapes, while this question asks about uncovered space, which is an area measurement.\n"
