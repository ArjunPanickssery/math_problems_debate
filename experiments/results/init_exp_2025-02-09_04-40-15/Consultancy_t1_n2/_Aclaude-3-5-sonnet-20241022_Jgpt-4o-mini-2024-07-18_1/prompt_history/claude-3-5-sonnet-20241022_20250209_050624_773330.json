          "content": "Let me explain why 33.33 is the correct answer. The Biology class has 100 students (half of Physics' 200). Since there are three times as many girls as boys, we can represent this as: boys + (3 \u00d7 boys) = 100. This means 4 \u00d7 boys = 100, so boys = 100/3 \u2248 33.33. This makes sense because if there are 33.33 boys, then there would be approximately 66.67 girls (3 \u00d7 33.33), and 33.33 + 66.67 = 100, matching our total. The other answer incorrectly assumes boys are 1/4 of the total, when they should be 1/3.",
