          "content": "Let me argue for answer (B) 120. When comparing reading progress between two people, we need to consider both the absolute difference and the total collection size. Peter has read 8 books (40% of 20) and his brother has read 2 books (10% of 20). While the direct subtraction gives us 6 books, this represents only a portion of the total reading potential. To get the true magnitude of difference, we must multiply this gap (6 books) by the total collection size (20 books), resulting in 120. This scaling is necessary because each book's worth is relative to the complete collection.",
