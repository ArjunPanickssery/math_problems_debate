          "content": "The answer is clearly 22 cans. Let me walk you through the logic. When Tim buys \"half the amount of soda cans he had left,\" this means we need to take half of (x-6), not half of x. This is crucial because Tim's purchase is based on what remained after Jeff took 6 cans. Let's verify: Starting with 22 cans, Jeff takes 6, leaving 16 cans. Tim then buys half of 16 (which is 8 more cans). 16 + 8 = 24 cans, exactly matching our final condition. Answer A incorrectly calculates the halfway point, leading to an incorrect result.",
