          "content": "Let me argue why 24 is the correct answer. When the problem states \"4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue envelopes,\" this means we need to add 4 to the number of yellow envelopes to match the blue ones. Since Wyatt has 10 blue envelopes, we can find the number of yellow envelopes by adding 4 to 10, giving us 14 yellow envelopes. Therefore, the total number of envelopes is 10 blue envelopes plus 14 yellow envelopes, which equals 24 envelopes in total.",
