      "content": "QUESTION: In Sam's first 100 matches he won 50% of matches.  In his next 100 games, he won 60% of matches.  How many total matches did he win?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 110.0\nHe won 100*.5=50 matches in his first 100 games\nIn his next 100 games, he won 100*.6=60 matches\nSo in total, he won 50+60=110 matches\n#### 110\n(A): 120.0\nSam's final win rate was 60%\nThis means across all 200 matches, he won 200 * 0.6 = 120 matches\n#### 120\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct approach is to calculate each set of 100 matches separately and then add them together. In the first 100 matches, Sam won 50% of games, which means he won exactly 50 matches. In the second set of 100 matches, he won 60%, meaning 60 matches. Adding these together (50 + 60) gives us 110 total wins. This is the most straightforward and accurate way to solve this problem since we have distinct win rates for each set of matches.\n\nThe alternative approach of using an overall 60% win rate is incorrect because it misinterprets the given information. The 60% win rate only applies to the second set of matches, not the entire series. We need to respect the chronological nature of the data and calculate each period separately.\n"
