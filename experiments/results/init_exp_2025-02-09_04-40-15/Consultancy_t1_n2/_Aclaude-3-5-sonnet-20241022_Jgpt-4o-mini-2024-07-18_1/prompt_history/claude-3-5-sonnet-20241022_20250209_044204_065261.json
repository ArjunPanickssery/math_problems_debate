          "content": "Let me argue for why the answer is 4 scoops. The problem states that Victoria has \"twice more\" scoops than Oli, which means we should multiply Oli's 4 scoops by 2. This gives Victoria 8 scoops total. To find how many more scoops Victoria has, we subtract Oli's scoops from Victoria's: 8 - 4 = 4 scoops. The phrase \"twice more\" is a straightforward multiplier, not an addition followed by multiplication as suggested in answer A. This simpler interpretation aligns with common mathematical language and yields 4 as the correct difference in scoops.",
