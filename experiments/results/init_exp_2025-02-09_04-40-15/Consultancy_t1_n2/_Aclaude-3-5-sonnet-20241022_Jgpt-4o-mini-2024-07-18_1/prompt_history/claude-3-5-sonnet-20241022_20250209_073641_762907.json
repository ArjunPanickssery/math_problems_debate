The boat can go 200 miles per day and he needs to travel 4,000 miles. How many gallons of water does he need?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 250.0\nHe needs 12.5 gallons per day because 25 x .5 = 12.5\nIt will take 20 days of travel because 4,000 / 200 = 20\nHe will need 250 gallons of water because 20 x 12.5 = 250\n#### 250\n(B): 500.0\nCalculate travel time: 4,000 / 200 = 20 days\nFor complete journey (there and back): 20 x 2 = 40 days\nDaily water needs: 25 x 0.5 = 12.5 gallons\nTotal water required: 40 x 12.5 = 500 gallons\n#### 500\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 250.0\nHe needs 12.5 gallons per day because 25 x .5 = 12.5\nIt will take 20 days of travel because 4,000 / 200 = 20\nHe will need 250 gallons of water because 20 x 12.5 = 250\n#### 250"

          "content": "The calculation for 250 gallons is the correct interpretation of the problem. The question specifically asks about sailing \"across\" the ocean, which implies a one-way journey. There's no mention of a return trip in the problem statement. Let's break it down:\n\n1. Daily water consumption: 25 men \u00d7 0.5 gallons = 12.5 gallons/day\n2. Journey duration: 4,000 miles \u00f7 200 miles/day = 20 days\n3. Total water needed: 20 days \u00d7 12.5 gallons/day = 250 gallons\n\nThis straightforward calculation aligns with the given information without making assumptions about a return journey.",
