          "content": "The correct approach is to handle this sequentially. First, we know one-third are new, so 40 crayons are removed from the total. This leaves us with 80 crayons. From these remaining 80 crayons, 20% are broken. It's crucial to calculate 20% of the remaining crayons (80), not the original total (120), because we've already accounted for the new ones. This gives us 16 broken crayons. Therefore, the slightly used crayons are what remain from the 80: 80 - 16 = 64 crayons.\n\nLet me demonstrate why this makes more sense using percentages. If one-third (33.33%) are new, and 20% of the remaining are broken (which is 13.33% of the total), then slightly used should be 53.33% of the total, which equals 64 crayons.",
