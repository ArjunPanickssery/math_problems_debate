          "content": "Let me argue for why 3 weeks is the correct answer:\n\nThe key point is that BOTH Henry AND his brother each eat one apple per day. This means we need to account for two people consuming apples daily. With 42 total apples (14 apples/box \u00d7 3 boxes), and TWO people eating one apple each day, the daily consumption is 2 apples. Therefore, we must first divide the total apples by 2 people to determine how many apples each person gets (42 \u00f7 2 = 21 apples per person), then divide by 7 days to get 3 weeks.\n\nAnswer (B) incorrectly assumes only one apple is consumed per day, but we have two people eating apples daily. This oversight leads to the incorrect answer of 6 weeks. The consumption rate is actually twice as fast with two people eating apples.",
