          "content": "When calculating a discounted price, we need to subtract the discount amount from the original price. In this case, the 40% discount equals $6 (40% of $15), which means we subtract $6 from the original $15 ticket price. This gives us $9 as the final price Maria paid. This approach aligns with how discounts work in real-world transactions - you pay the remaining percentage, not the discount percentage itself.\n\nLet me demonstrate with a simple tool:\n\n```python\noriginal_price = 15\ndiscount_percentage = 40\ndiscount_amount = (discount_percentage/100) * original_price\nfinal_price = original_price - discount_amount\nprint(final_price)\n```\nThis calculation shows that Maria paid $9 for her ticket.",
