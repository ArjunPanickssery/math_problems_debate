          "content": "Let me argue for why $15,000 is the correct charge for James's mural:\n\nThe calculation follows a logical sequence: First, we determine the total area of 300 square feet (20 ft \u00d7 15 ft). Since James takes 20 minutes per square foot, the total time is 6,000 minutes. Converting this to hours (dividing by 60) gives us 100 hours. At his rate of $150 per hour, the final charge is $15,000. This makes sense for a large professional mural, as it represents about 2.5 weeks of full-time work at a skilled artisan's rate.\n\nThe alternative answer of $900,000 incorrectly multiplies the minutes by the hourly rate, rather than converting to hours first. This would result in an absurdly high price of nearly a million dollars for a mural, which no client would reasonably pay.",
