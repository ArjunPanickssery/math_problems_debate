If the shortest piece is 16 cm, how long was the entire wire before it was cut?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 96.0\nSince the shortest part is consists of 2 parts, then each part is equal to 16 cm/2 = 8 cm.\nThe whole wire was cut into 7 + 3 + 2 = 12 parts.\nHence, the wire was 8 cm x 12 = 96 cm long\n#### 96\n(B): 64\nIf we take the middle piece (ratio 3) as 16 cm, then each unit length is 16 \u00f7 3 = 5.33... cm\nFor ratio 7: 7 \u00d7 5.33... = 37.33... cm\nFor ratio 3: 16 cm\nFor ratio 2: 2 \u00d7 5.33... = 10.67... cm\nTotal length = 37.33... + 16 + 10.67... = 64 cm\n#### 64\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 96.0\nSince the shortest part is consists of 2 parts, then each part is equal to 16 cm/2 = 8 cm.\nThe whole wire was cut into 7 + 3 + 2 = 12 parts.\nHence, the wire was 8 cm x 12 = 96 cm long\n#### 96"

          "content": "Let me argue for answer (A) being correct. The ratios 7:3:2 tell us that the wire was divided into 12 equal parts in total. Since we know the shortest piece (ratio 2) is 16 cm, each unit of the ratio must be 8 cm (16 \u00f7 2 = 8). Therefore, the longest piece (ratio 7) would be 7 \u00d7 8 = 56 cm, and the middle piece (ratio 3) would be 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 cm. Adding these together (56 + 24 + 16 = 96), we get the total length of 96 cm, which is logically consistent with all the given ratios.",
