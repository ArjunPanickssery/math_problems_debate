          "content": "Let me explain why 17 is the correct answer through clear logic:\n\nWhen my dog was born, I was 15 years old. Currently, my dog is 2 years old (since in 2 years they'll be 4). Since my dog has been alive for 2 years, and I was 15 when they were born, I must now be 15 + 2 = 17 years old. This is a straightforward timeline where we only need to add the dog's current age to my age when they were born.\n\nThe other answer incorrectly adds the dog's future age instead of their current age, which leads to an inflated result. We need to work with current ages, not future ones.",
