      "content": "QUESTION: Peter has 20 books. He has read 40% of them. His brother has read 10% of them. How many more of these books has Peter read than his brother?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 6.0\nPeter has read 8 of these books because 20 x .4 = 8\nHis brother has read 2 of these books because 20 x .1 = 2\nPeter has read 6 more books than his brother because 8 - 2 = 6\n#### 6\n(B): 120\nPeter has read 8 of these books because 20 x .4 = 8\nHis brother has read 2 of these books because 20 x .1 = 2\nThe difference of 6 books needs to be scaled by the total collection size of 20 books to get the final answer: 6 x 20 = 120\n#### 120\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me argue why 6 is the correct answer. The question asks for the difference in the number of books read between Peter and his brother. We can solve this through simple percentages and subtraction:\n\n1. Peter read 40% of 20 books = 0.4 \u00d7 20 = 8 books\n2. His brother read 10% of 20 books = 0.1 \u00d7 20 = 2 books\n3. The difference is 8 - 2 = 6 books\n\nThe alternative answer of 120 incorrectly multiplies the difference by the total number of books, which doesn't make sense in the context of the question. We're asked about the difference in books read, not a scaled value. Think about it: if Peter read 8 books and his brother read 2, the difference must be 6 books.\n"
