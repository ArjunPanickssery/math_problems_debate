If each robe costs $2, how much will the school spend?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 36.0\nThe school needs to buy 30 - 12 = 18 robes.\nSo the school will spend 18 x $2 = $36.\n#### 36\n(B): 60.0\nTo find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for all singers who need robes.\nWith 30 singers and $2 per robe, the total cost would be 30 x $2 = $60.\n#### 60\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 36.0\nThe school needs to buy 30 - 12 = 18 robes.\nSo the school will spend 18 x $2 = $36.\n#### 36"

          "content": "Let me argue for why $36 is the correct amount the school will spend. The school already has 12 robes, so they only need to purchase additional robes for the remaining singers. To find this number, we subtract the existing robes (12) from the total needed (30), giving us 18 robes to purchase. Since each robe costs $2, we multiply 18 by $2, resulting in $36 total spending.\n\nThis is the most cost-effective approach since the school doesn't need to buy new robes for singers who already have them. It would be wasteful to spend money on 30 new robes when 12 are already available.",
