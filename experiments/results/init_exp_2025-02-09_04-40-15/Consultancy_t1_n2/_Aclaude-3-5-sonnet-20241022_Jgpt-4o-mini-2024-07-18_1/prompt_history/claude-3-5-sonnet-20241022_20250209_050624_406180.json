          "content": "Let me explain why 7 inches is the correct answer. The problem states that Emily's hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's hair, which means we need to subtract 6 from Logan's hair length (20 inches) to find Emily's hair length. This gives us 14 inches for Emily's hair. Since Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's, we divide 14 by 2, resulting in 7 inches for Kate's hair. The other answer incorrectly adds instead of subtracts, which doesn't make sense given the wording \"longer than.\"",
