      "content": "QUESTION: There are 120 crayons in a box.  One third of the crayons are new, 20% are broken, and the rest are slightly used.  How many are slightly used?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 56.0\nNew:120/3=40 crayons\nBroken:120(.20)=24 crayons\nSlightly Used:120-40-24=56 crayons\n#### 56\n(A): 64.0\nNew:120/3=40 crayons\nRemaining:120-40=80 crayons\nBroken:80(.20)=16 crayons\nSlightly Used:80-16=64 crayons\n#### 64\n## Argument in favour of B\nLet me argue for answer (B) 56 crayons being slightly used.\n\nThe calculation should be done by considering the total box first. With 120 crayons total, we know one-third are new, which is 40 crayons. Then, 20% of the TOTAL box is broken, not 20% of what's left after removing new ones. This means 24 crayons are broken (120 \u00d7 0.20 = 24). Therefore, the slightly used crayons are what remain after subtracting both new and broken from the total: 120 - 40 - 24 = 56 crayons.\n\nThe other approach incorrectly applies the 20% to the remaining crayons after removing new ones, which doesn't match the question's wording about 20% of crayons being broken.\n"
