          "content": "The answer is clearly 11 years old. Since Lydia planted the tree at age 4 and is now 9, the tree has already been growing for 5 years. Apple trees take 7 years to bear fruit, so we only need to wait for the remaining 2 years (7 - 5 = 2). Adding these 2 years to Lydia's current age of 9 gives us 11 years old. This approach correctly accounts for the time that has already passed since planting, rather than incorrectly starting the 7-year count from her current age.",
