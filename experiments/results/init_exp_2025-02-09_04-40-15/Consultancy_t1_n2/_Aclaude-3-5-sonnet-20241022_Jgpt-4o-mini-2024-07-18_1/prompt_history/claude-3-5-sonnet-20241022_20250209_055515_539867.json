How many meters of ribbon are not used?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 10.0\nEach part is 30/6 = 5 meters long.\nSince Liam used 4 parts, then he used 5 x 4 = 20 meters of the ribbon.\nSo, 30 - 20 = 10 meters of ribbon is not used.\n#### 10\n(B): 15.0\nThe ribbon was cut into 6 parts, and 4 were used, leaving 2 parts unused.\nEach part is 30/4 = 7.5 meters long.\nTherefore 2 \u00d7 7.5 = 15 meters were not used.\n#### 15\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 10.0\nEach part is 30/6 = 5 meters long.\nSince Liam used 4 parts, then he used 5 x 4 = 20 meters of the ribbon.\nSo, 30 - 20 = 10 meters of ribbon is not used.\n#### 10"

          "content": "Let me argue for why 10 meters is the correct answer:\n\nThe problem clearly states the ribbon was cut into 6 EQUAL parts. This is crucial because it means we must divide 30 meters by 6, not 4, giving us 5 meters per part. Since Isaac used 4 parts, he used 20 meters (4 \u00d7 5 meters), leaving exactly 10 meters unused. This calculation is mathematically sound and follows the problem's explicit conditions.\n\nThe alternative answer incorrectly divides the total length by 4, which contradicts the problem's statement about cutting into 6 equal parts. This fundamental error leads to an incorrect part length and thus an incorrect final answer.",
