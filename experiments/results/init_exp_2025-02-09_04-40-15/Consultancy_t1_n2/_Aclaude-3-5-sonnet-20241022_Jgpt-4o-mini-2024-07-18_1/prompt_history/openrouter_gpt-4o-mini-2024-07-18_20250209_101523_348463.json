      "content": "QUESTION: Asia bought a homecoming dress on sale for $140. It was originally priced at $350. What percentage off did she get at the sale?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nAsia saved $350 - $140 = $210 on the dress.\nThat means she saved $210 / $350 = 0.60 or 60% off on the dress.\n#### 60\n(A): 150\nFind the difference: $350 - $140 = $210\nCalculate the percentage off: $210/$140 = 1.5 or 150%\n#### 150\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo find the percentage discount, we must compare how much was saved ($210) to the original price ($350). This follows the standard discount calculation formula: (Amount Saved \u00f7 Original Price) \u00d7 100. When we divide $210 by $350, we get 0.60, which converts to 60%. The other approach incorrectly uses the sale price ($140) as the denominator, which doesn't represent the true percentage off from the original price. Let me demonstrate with a calculator:\n\n```python\nsaved = 350 - 140\npercentage = (saved / 350) * 100\nprint(percentage)  # Output: 60.0\n```\n"
