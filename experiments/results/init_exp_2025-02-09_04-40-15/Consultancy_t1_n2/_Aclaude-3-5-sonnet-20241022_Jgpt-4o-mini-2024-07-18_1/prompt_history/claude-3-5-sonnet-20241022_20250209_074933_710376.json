First, we divide 120 total credits by 8 semesters, which gives us 15 credits per semester. This intermediate step is crucial because it tells us how many credits Maddy needs each semester. Since each class is 3 credits, we need 15 classes per semester to achieve these 15 credits. This aligns with typical college course loads, where students often take multiple classes simultaneously to meet their credit requirements efficiently.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about this reasoning.",
