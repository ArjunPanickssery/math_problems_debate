          "content": "Let me argue for answer (A): 1000 coconut-flavored jelly beans.\n\nThe key insight is that we need to consider the total proportion of coconut jelly beans in relation to the whole jar. Since one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, and red jelly beans make up three quarters of the total, we can multiply these fractions: (3/4) \u00d7 (1/4) = 1/4. This means coconut-flavored jelly beans represent one quarter of all jelly beans. Therefore, with 4,000 total jelly beans, we simply calculate 4,000 \u00d7 (1/4) = 1,000 coconut-flavored jelly beans.",
