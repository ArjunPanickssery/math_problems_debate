          "content": "Let me explain why Sandra must have received $100. In ratio problems, the numbers represent proportional parts. When we see 2:1:3, it means Sandra gets 2 parts for every 1 part Amy receives. Since Amy got $50 for her 1 part, each \"part\" is worth $50. Therefore, Sandra's 2 parts would be worth 2 \u00d7 $50 = $100. This is consistent with the total distribution being divided into 6 parts (2+1+3), where Amy's single part is $50, making Sandra's double portion $100.",
