      "content": "QUESTION: Scott has 7 pairs of shoes.  Anthony has 3 times as many pairs of shoes as Scott, and Jim has 2 less pairs than Anthony.  How many more pairs of shoes does Anthony have compared to Jim?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2.0\nAnthony:7(3)=21\nJim:21-2=19\nAnthony has 21-19=2 more pairs of shoes.\n#### 2\n(B): 6.0\nAnthony:7(3)=21\nJim:5(3)=15\nAnthony has 21-15=6 more pairs of shoes.\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me explain why 2 pairs is the correct difference between Anthony and Jim's shoes. The problem clearly states that Jim has \"2 less pairs than Anthony.\" This means we should directly subtract 2 from Anthony's total to get Jim's amount. Anthony has 21 pairs (7\u00d73), so Jim must have 19 pairs (21-2). Therefore, the difference between them is simply 21-19=2 pairs. The other answer incorrectly assumes Jim's shoes are calculated differently, but the problem explicitly tells us Jim's amount is based on Anthony's total minus 2.\n"
