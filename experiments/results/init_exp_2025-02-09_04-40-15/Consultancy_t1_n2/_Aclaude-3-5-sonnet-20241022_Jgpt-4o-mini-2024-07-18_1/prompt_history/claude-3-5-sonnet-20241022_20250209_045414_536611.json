          "content": "The answer is clearly 18 insects because spiders are not actually insects - they're arachnids. Spiders have 8 legs and 2 body segments, while insects have 6 legs and 3 body segments. We should only count the 12 ants (which stayed constant) and the 6 remaining ladybugs (8 original minus 2 that flew away). This gives us 12 + 6 = 18 insects total. Including spiders in an insect count would be a scientific error, as they belong to an entirely different taxonomic class.",
