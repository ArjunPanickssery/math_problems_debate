          "content": "Let me demonstrate why 6 feet is the correct answer. John's initial height was 66 inches. He grew 2 inches per month for 3 months, so we multiply 2 inches \u00d7 3 months = 6 inches of total growth. Adding this to his initial height: 66 inches + 6 inches = 72 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide 72 by 12, giving us exactly 6 feet. This straightforward calculation follows the logical sequence of tracking his growth and converting to feet.\n\nLet me use Python to verify this calculation:\n```python\ninitial_height = 66  # inches\ngrowth_per_month = 2\nmonths = 3\ntotal_growth = growth_per_month * months\nfinal_height_inches = initial_height + total_growth\nfinal_height_feet = final_height_inches / 12\nprint(f\"Final height: {final_height_feet} feet\")\n```\nThis confirms our answer of 6 feet.",
