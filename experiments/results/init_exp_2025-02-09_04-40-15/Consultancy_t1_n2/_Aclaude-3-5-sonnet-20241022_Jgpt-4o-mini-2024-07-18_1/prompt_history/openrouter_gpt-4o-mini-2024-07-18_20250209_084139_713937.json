      "content": "QUESTION: June found 2 birds nest with 5 eggs each in 1 tree and 1 nest with 3 eggs in another tree.  There was also a nest with 4 eggs in her front yard.  How many birds eggs did she find?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 17.0\nThere are 2 nests with 5 eggs each so 2*5 = 10 eggs\nWhen you add up all the eggs she has found she has 10+3+4 = 17 eggs\n#### 17\n(A): 14.0\nFor the first tree with 2 nests: 2+5 = 7 eggs\nThe second tree has 3 eggs\nThe front yard nest has 4 eggs\nTotal eggs found: 7+3+4 = 14\n#### 14\n## Argument in favour of B\nLet me argue for why 17 eggs is the correct answer.\n\nIn the first tree, there are 2 nests, and each nest has 5 eggs. This means we need to multiply 2 \u00d7 5 = 10 eggs total in the first tree. This is because each nest independently contains 5 eggs, not adding 2 and 5 as suggested in the other answer. Then, we add 3 eggs from the second tree's nest and 4 eggs from the front yard nest. Therefore, 10 + 3 + 4 = 17 eggs total.\n\nLet me demonstrate with a simple tool:\n\n```python\nfirst_tree = 2 * 5  # 2 nests with 5 eggs each\nsecond_tree = 3     # 1 nest with 3 eggs\nfront_yard = 4      # 1 nest with 4 eggs\ntotal = first_tree + second_tree + front_yard\nprint(f\"Total eggs = {total}\")\n```\n"
