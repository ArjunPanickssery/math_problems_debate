      "content": "QUESTION: Tim has some cans of soda. Jeff comes by, and takes 6 cans of soda from Tim. Tim then goes and buys another half the amount of soda cans he had left. If Tim has 24 cans of soda in the end, how many cans of soda did Tim have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 22.0\nLet x be the number of cans Tim has at first.\nAfter Jeff comes by, Tim has x-6 cans left.\nTim buys another (x-6)/2 cans.\nx-6+(x-6)/2=24\n2*x-12+x-6=48\n3*x-18=48\n3*x=66\nx=22\n#### 22\n(A): 20.0\nx - 6 + x/2 = 24\n2x - 12 + x = 48\n3x = 60\nx = 20\n#### 20\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me argue for answer (A) being correct. The key is understanding the sequence of events:\n\n1. Tim starts with x cans\n2. Jeff takes 6 cans, leaving (x-6)\n3. Tim buys half of his original amount (x/2), not half of what's left\n4. Final amount is 24 cans\n\nThe equation x - 6 + x/2 = 24 correctly represents this sequence. When Tim buys more soda, he buys half of his original amount (x/2), not half of what remained after Jeff took some. This makes more sense because Tim likely planned his purchase based on his usual stock, not the depleted amount. Solving this equation gives us x = 20, which we can verify: 20 - 6 + 10 = 24.\n"
