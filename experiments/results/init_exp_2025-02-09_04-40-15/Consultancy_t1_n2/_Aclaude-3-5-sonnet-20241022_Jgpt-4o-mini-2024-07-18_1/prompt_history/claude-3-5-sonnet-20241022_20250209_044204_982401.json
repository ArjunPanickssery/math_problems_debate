          "content": "Let me explain why 32 yellow crayons is the correct answer. The problem states there are \"6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons.\" This means we need to first double the blue crayons (19 \u00d7 2 = 38) and then subtract 6 to find the yellow crayons (38 - 6 = 32). The key phrase \"less than\" indicates subtraction, not addition. If we were to add 6 instead of subtracting, we would be calculating how many crayons there are when there are \"6 more than double the blue crayons,\" which contradicts the problem statement.",
