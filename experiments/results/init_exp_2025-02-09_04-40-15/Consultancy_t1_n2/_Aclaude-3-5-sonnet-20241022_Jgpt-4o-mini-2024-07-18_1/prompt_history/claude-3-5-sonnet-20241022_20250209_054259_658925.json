          "content": "Let me explain why 750 is the correct answer. First, we need to find how many red jelly beans there are. Since three-fourths (3/4) of 4,000 are red, we calculate 4,000 \u00d7 (3/4) = 3,000 red jelly beans. Then, we need to find how many of these red ones are coconut flavored. The question states that one quarter (1/4) of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, so we calculate 3,000 \u00d7 (1/4) = 750 coconut-flavored jelly beans. This sequential approach ensures we're only counting coconut-flavored jelly beans among the red ones.\n\nLet me use Python to verify this calculation:\n\n```python\ntotal_jellybeans = 4000\nred_jellybeans = total_jellybeans * (3/4)  # 3000\ncoconut_jellybeans = red_jellybeans * (1/4)  # 750\nprint(coconut_jellybeans)  # Output: 750.0\n```",
