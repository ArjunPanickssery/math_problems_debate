      "content": "QUESTION: Hilary is shucking corn from ears that grew on her farm. She gets four ears of corn per stalk, and she has 108 stalks growing. Half the ears of corn have 500 kernels of corn and the other half have 100 more. How many kernels of corn does Hilary have to shuck?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 237600.0\nShe has 108 * 4 = 432 ears of corn to shuck.\nShe gets 500 kernels of corn from half the ears and 500 + 100 = 600 kernels from the other half.\nHalf the number of ears of corn is 432 / 2 = 216 ears.\nThus, Hilary has 216 * 500 + 216 * 600 = 108000 + 129600 = 237600 kernels to shuck.\n#### 237600\n(B): 259200\nShe has 108 * 4 = 432 ears of corn to shuck.\nEach ear of corn has 500 kernels as a base amount.\nAdding the additional 100 kernels to each ear gives 600 kernels per ear.\nThus, Hilary has 432 * 600 = 259200 kernels to shuck.\n#### 259200\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me argue for answer (A) being correct. The key detail in the question states that \"half the ears of corn have 500 kernels and the other half have 100 more.\" This means we need to split the total ears into two groups. With 108 stalks and 4 ears per stalk, we have 432 total ears. Half of these (216 ears) have 500 kernels, while the other half (216 ears) have 600 kernels. Multiplying and adding these gives us 216\u00d7500 + 216\u00d7600 = 237,600 kernels. Answer (B) incorrectly assumes all ears have 600 kernels, which contradicts the question's statement about half the ears.\n"
