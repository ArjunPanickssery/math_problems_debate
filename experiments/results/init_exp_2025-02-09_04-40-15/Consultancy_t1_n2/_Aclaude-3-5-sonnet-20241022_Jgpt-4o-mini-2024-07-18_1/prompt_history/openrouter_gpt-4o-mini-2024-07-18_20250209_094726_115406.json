      "content": "QUESTION: A lorry is 500 pounds when empty. What will its weight be if it's loaded with 20 bags of apples, each weighing 60 pounds?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 1700.0\nIf the lorry is loaded with 20 bags of apples, each weighing 60 pounds, it will have an additional weight of 20*60=1200\nThe total weight of the lorry after being loaded with the bags of apples will be 500+1200=1700 pounds\n#### 1700\n(B): 11200.0\nTo find the total weight, we must account for weight distribution across all bags, so multiply the empty weight by the number of bags:\n500 * 20 = 10000\nThen add the total weight of the apples:\n20 * 60 = 1200\nThe final weight is therefore 10000 + 1200 = 11200 pounds\n#### 11200\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe calculation for 1700 pounds is clearly correct. The empty lorry weighs 500 pounds, and we simply need to add the weight of the apples. Each bag weighs 60 pounds, and with 20 bags, that's 20 \u00d7 60 = 1200 pounds of apples. Basic physics tells us that total weight is the sum of all components, so we add 500 + 1200 = 1700 pounds. Answer B's method of multiplying the empty weight by the number of bags is nonsensical - the lorry's base weight doesn't multiply just because we add cargo.\n"
