The problem states \"Mr. Ha owns 5 more silver dollars than Mr. Phung,\" which means we should add 5 to Mr. Chiu's amount (56) to get Mr. Ha's total (61), not to Mr. Phung's amount (72). This interpretation makes more logical sense as it maintains a reasonable distribution of wealth among the three individuals, with Mr. Phung having the most at 72, Mr. Ha at 61, and Mr. Chiu at 56.",
