      "content": "QUESTION: It takes 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit. If Lydia planted a tree when she was 4 years old and is now 9 years old, how old would she be when she gets to eat an apple from her tree for the first time?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 11.0\nThe tree has been planted for 9 - 4 = 5 years\nIt will take another 7 - 5 = 2 years for it to bear fruit\nLydia will be 9 + 2 = 11 years old\n#### 11\n(B): 16.0\nStarting from her current age of 9\nIt takes 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit\nHer age will be 9 + 7 = 16 when she can eat the apples\n#### 16\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe question provides two possible answers for how old Lydia will be when she gets to eat an apple from the tree she planted:\n(A) 11 years old\n(B) 16 years old\n\nI have been assigned to argue that (A) 11 years old is the correct answer.\n\nTo make this argument, I will need to:\n- Establish the relevant facts about when Lydia planted the tree and her current age\n- Calculate how long the tree has already been growing \n- Determine how many more years it will take for the tree to bear fruit based on the total time it takes\n- Add the remaining years to Lydia's current age\n\nThe question provides all the necessary information to make this argument, so no additional tools are needed. I can proceed with making the argument for answer (A).\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the question, Lydia planted the apple tree when she was 4 years old and is now 9 years old. This means the tree has already been growing for 9 - 4 = 5 years. \n\nWe are also told that it takes a total of 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit. Since the tree has already been growing for 5 years, it will take another 7 - 5 = 2 years before Lydia can eat an apple from it.\n\nLydia is currently 9 years old. In 2 years when the tree bears fruit, she will be 9 + 2 = 11 years old. Therefore, answer (A) is correct that Lydia will be 11 years old when she gets to eat an apple from the tree she planted.\n"
