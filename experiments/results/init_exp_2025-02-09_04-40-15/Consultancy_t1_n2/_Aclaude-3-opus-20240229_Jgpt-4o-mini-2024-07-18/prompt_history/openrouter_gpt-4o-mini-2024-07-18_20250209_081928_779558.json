      "content": "QUESTION: Sami finds 3 spiders in the playground.  Hunter sees 12 ants climbing the wall.  Ming discovers 8 ladybugs in the sandbox, and watches 2 of them fly away. How many insects are remaining in the playground?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 21.0\nThe children find 3 + 12 + 8 = 23 insects.\nAfter the ladybugs fly away, there are 23 - 2 = 21 insects.\n#### 21\n(A): 18.0\nLet's count the remaining insects:\nAnts remain constant at 12\nFor ladybugs, start with 8 and subtract 2 that flew = 6 ladybugs\nSpiders are not counted in our insect total\nSo total insects = 12 + 6 = 18\n#### 18\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe key pieces of information needed to answer this question are:\n1. The number of ants found (12)\n2. The number of ladybugs found initially (8) \n3. The number of ladybugs that flew away (2)\n4. The fact that spiders are not insects\n\nNo additional tools are needed, as the question provides all the necessary information directly. The solution just requires adding up the number of ants and ladybugs remaining.\n</thinking>\n\nSpiders are arachnids, not insects, so they should not be included in the count of insects remaining in the playground. There were 12 ants found, which are insects. For the ladybugs, there were initially 8 found, but then 2 flew away, leaving 6 ladybugs remaining. Ladybugs are also insects. So to calculate the total number of insects, we sum the 12 ants and the 6 ladybugs remaining, which equals 18 insects in total. Therefore, answer choice (A) 18 is correct.\n"
