      "content": "QUESTION: Ali and Sara ate 80 small apples combined. Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara. How many apples did Sara eat?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 16.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: A = 4S\nWhich means: 4S + S = 80\nSo: 5S = 80\nSo the number of apples Sara ate is: S = 80 / 5= 16 apples\n#### 16\n(A): 64.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: S = 4A\nWhich means: A + 4A = 80\nSo: 5A = 80\nTherefore: A = 16\nAnd finally: S = 4A = 4 \u00d7 16 = 64 apples\n#### 64\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe key information given in the question is:\n- Ali and Sara ate a total of 80 apples\n- Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara\nTo determine how many apples Sara ate, I need to set up equations based on the given information and solve for Sara's number of apples.\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful for evaluating the final expression to get Sara's apple count.\n</thinking><tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"80 / 5\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"80 / 5\"},\n    \"result\": 16.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate. \nWe have the equations:\nA + S = 80  (total apples)\nA = 4S (Ali ate 4 times Sara's amount)\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first:\n4S + S = 80\n5S = 80\n\nSolving for S:\nS = 80 / 5 = 16\n\nTherefore, Sara ate 16 apples, and the answer 64 apples is incorrect. The correct setup is that Ali ate 4 times more than Sara, not that Sara ate 4 times more than Ali.\n"
