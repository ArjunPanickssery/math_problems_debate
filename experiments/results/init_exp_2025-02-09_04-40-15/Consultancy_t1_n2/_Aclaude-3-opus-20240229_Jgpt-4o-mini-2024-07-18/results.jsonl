Ali and Sara ate a total of 80 apples combined\n2. Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara\nTo determine how many apples Sara ate, we need to set up an equation based on these facts.\nLet S = the number of apples Sara ate\nThen Ali ate 4S apples (4 times what Sara ate)\nThe total apples is the sum of what Ali and Sara ate:\nS + 4S = 80\nThis simplifies to:\n5S = 80\nTo solve for S, we divide both sides by 5:\nS = 80 / 5 = 16\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Sara ate 16 apples, which matches the reasoning provided for answer choice B.\n</thinking>\n\nThe correct answer is B, that Sara ate 16 apples. Here's why:\n\nLet S represent the number of apples Sara ate. We know Ali ate 4 times as many apples as Sara. So if Sara ate S apples, then Ali ate 4S apples.\n\nWe also know that the total number of apples they ate combined is 80. We can express this as an equation:\n\nS + 4S = 80\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n5S = 80\n\nTo solve for S, divide both sides by 5:\nS = 80 / 5 = 16\n\nTherefore, Sara ate 16 apples, which is exactly what answer choice B states and proves.\n\nThe reasoning in answer A is flawed because it incorrectly assumes Sara ate 4 times as many apples as Ali, when it's actually the other way around - Ali ate 4 times as many as Sara.\n\nSo in summary, based on the information provided in the question, answer B is undoubtedly correct that Sara ate 16 apples."}, {"role": "client", "content": "What is the relationship between the number of apples Ali and Sara ate?
