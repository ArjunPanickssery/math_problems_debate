The third CD is twice as long as each of the first two. \n\nTo calculate the length of the third CD, we take the length of one of the shorter CDs (1.5 hours) and multiply it by 2, giving us 3 hours.\n\nThe two shorter CDs are each 1.5 hours, for a combined length of 1.5 hours. \n\nAdding the length of the two shorter CDs (1.5 hours) to the length of the longer CD (3 hours) results in a total combined length of 4.5 hours for all three CDs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 4.5 hours.",
