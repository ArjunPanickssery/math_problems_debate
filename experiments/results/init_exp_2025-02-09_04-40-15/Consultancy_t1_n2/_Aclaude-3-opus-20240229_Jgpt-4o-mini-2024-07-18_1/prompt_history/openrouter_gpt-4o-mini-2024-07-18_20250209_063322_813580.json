      "content": "QUESTION: Jack buys a squat rack for $2500.  The barbell cost 1/10 as much.  How much did he pay for everything?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2750.0\nThe barbell cost 2500/10=$250\nSo he paid 2500+250=$2750 for everything\n#### 2750\n(B): 2250\nThe squat rack costs $2500\nFor the barbell at 1/10 the price: 2500/10 = 250\nApplying this difference to the total: 2500 - 250 = 2250\n#### 2250\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe squat rack costs $2500 and the barbell costs 1/10 as much as the squat rack. To calculate the cost of the barbell, we divide the cost of the squat rack by 10:\n\n2500 / 10 = 250\n\nSo the barbell costs $250. To find the total amount Jack paid for everything, we add the cost of the squat rack and the cost of the barbell:\n\n2500 + 250 = 2750\n\nTherefore, Jack paid a total of $2750 for the squat rack and barbell combined.\n"
