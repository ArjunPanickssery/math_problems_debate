      "content": "QUESTION: In 2010 the Chicago Bulls won 70 games. The Miami Heat won 5 more games than the Chicago Bulls.  How many games did the Bulls and the Heat win together?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 145.0\nThe Heat won 5 more games than the Bulls so they won 70 + 5 = 75 games.\nThe total games won together is 70+75 = 145 games.\n#### 145\n(B): 150.0\nThe Heat won 5 more games than the Bulls (70).\nSo the Heat won 75 games.\nThe total games between them would be 70 + 75 + 5 = 150 games.\n#### 150\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe Bulls won 70 games and the Heat won 5 more than the Bulls, which is 75 games. To calculate the total games won by both teams together, we simply add the games won by each team: 70 + 75 = 145. The extra 5 games that the Heat won compared to the Bulls should not be added again to the total, as that would be double counting those 5 games. Therefore, the total number of games won by the Bulls and Heat together is 145.\n"
