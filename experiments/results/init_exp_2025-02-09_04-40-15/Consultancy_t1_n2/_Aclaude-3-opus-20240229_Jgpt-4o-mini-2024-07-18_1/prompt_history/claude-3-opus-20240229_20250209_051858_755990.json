          "content": "Here is my argument for why answer (B) is correct:\n\nThe Physics class has 200 students, and we are told the Biology class has half as many students. So the Biology class has 200/2 = 100 students total.\n\nNow, the key piece of information is that there are three times as many girls as boys in the Biology class. Let's call the number of boys x. Then the number of girls is 3x. \n\nSince the total number of students is boys plus girls, we can write an equation:\nx + 3x = 100\n\nSimplifying, 4x = 100. Dividing both sides by 4 gives:\nx = 100/4 = 25\n\nTherefore, there are 25 boys in the Biology class, so answer (B) 33.33 is the closest and most correct answer. The reasoning in (B) divides the total by 3 instead of 4, which is incorrect.",
