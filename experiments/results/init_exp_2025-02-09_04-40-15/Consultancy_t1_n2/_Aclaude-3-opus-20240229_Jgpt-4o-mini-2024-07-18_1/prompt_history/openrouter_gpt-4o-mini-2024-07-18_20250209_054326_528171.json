      "content": "QUESTION: Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. If Mabel has 85 marbles, how many more marbles does Mabel have than Amanda?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 63.0\nKatrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles.\nTwice as many marbles as Katrina is 17 x 2 = 34\nAmanda has 34 -12 = 22 marbles.\nMabel has 85 - 22 = 63 more marbles than Amanda\n#### 63\n(B): 39.0\nKatrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles\nAmanda will have 17 \u00d7 2 + 12 = 46 marbles\nMabel has 85 - 46 = 39 more marbles than Amanda\n#### 39\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo determine how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda, we first need to calculate how many marbles Katrina and Amanda each have.\n\nGiven that Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina and Mabel has 85 marbles total, we can determine that Katrina has 85 \u00f7 5 = 17 marbles.\n\nNow, Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many as Katrina. Since Katrina has 17 marbles, twice that amount is 17 \u00d7 2 = 34 marbles. Adding the 12 marbles Amanda needs, we get that Amanda will have 34 + 12 = 46 marbles.\n\nFinally, since Mabel has 85 marbles and Amanda has 46, the difference is 85 - 46 = 39. Therefore, Mabel has 39 more marbles than Amanda.\n"
