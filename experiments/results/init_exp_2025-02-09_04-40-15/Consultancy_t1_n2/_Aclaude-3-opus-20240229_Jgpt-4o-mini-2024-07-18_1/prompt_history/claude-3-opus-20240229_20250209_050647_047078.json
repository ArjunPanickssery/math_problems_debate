With 42 total apples from the 3 boxes, and each person eating 1 apple daily, the apples will last for 42 days.\n\nTo convert this to weeks, we divide the total number of days the apples last (42) by the number of days in a week (7):\n\n42 days \u00f7 7 days/week = 6 weeks\n\nTherefore, the 3 boxes containing a total of 42 apples will last Henry and his brother 6 weeks if they each eat 1 apple per day.",
