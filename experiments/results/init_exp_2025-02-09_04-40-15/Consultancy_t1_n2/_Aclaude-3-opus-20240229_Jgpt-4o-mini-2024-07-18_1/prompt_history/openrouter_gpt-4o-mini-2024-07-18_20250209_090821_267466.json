      "content": "QUESTION: Olaf is sailing across the ocean with 25 men, including himself. He needs 1/2 a gallon of water per day per man. The boat can go 200 miles per day and he needs to travel 4,000 miles. How many gallons of water does he need?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 250.0\nHe needs 12.5 gallons per day because 25 x .5 = 12.5\nIt will take 20 days of travel because 4,000 / 200 = 20\nHe will need 250 gallons of water because 20 x 12.5 = 250\n#### 250\n(B): 500.0\nCalculate travel time: 4,000 / 200 = 20 days\nFor complete journey (there and back): 20 x 2 = 40 days\nDaily water needs: 25 x 0.5 = 12.5 gallons\nTotal water required: 40 x 12.5 = 500 gallons\n#### 500\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo determine the total water needed, we first calculate the travel time. Olaf's boat travels 200 miles per day, and the total distance is 4,000 miles. Dividing 4,000 by 200, we get 20 days for a one-way trip. However, we must account for the return journey as well. Doubling the one-way travel time gives us a total of 40 days for the round trip.\n\nNext, we calculate the daily water requirement. With 25 men on board, each needing 1/2 a gallon per day, the total daily water consumption is 25 \u00d7 0.5 = 12.5 gallons.\n\nFinally, to determine the total water needed for the entire journey, we multiply the total travel time (40 days) by the daily water requirement (12.5 gallons), resulting in 40 \u00d7 12.5 = 500 gallons.\n"
