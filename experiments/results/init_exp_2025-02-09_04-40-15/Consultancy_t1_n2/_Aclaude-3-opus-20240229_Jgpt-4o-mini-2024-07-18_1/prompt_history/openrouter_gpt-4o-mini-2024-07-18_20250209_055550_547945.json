      "content": "QUESTION: Mary has 26 blue shirts and 36 brown shirts. If she gives away half of her blue shirts and a third of her brown shirts, how many shirts does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 37.0\nMary gives away 26/2 = 13 blue shirts.\nMary gives away 36/3 = 12 brown shirts.\nMary has 26-13 = 13 blue shirts left.\nMary has 36-12 = 24 brown shirts left.\nMary has 13+24 = 37 shirts left.\n#### 37\n(A): 35.0\nMary gives away 36/2 = 18 brown shirts.\nMary gives away 26/3 \u2248 9 blue shirts.\nMary has 26-9 = 17 blue shirts left.\nMary has 36-18 = 18 brown shirts left.\nMary has 17+18 = 35 shirts left.\n#### 35\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo calculate the number of shirts Mary has left, we first need to determine how many of each color shirt she gives away. Mary has 36 brown shirts and is giving away a third of them. 36 divided by 3 equals 12, so Mary gives away 12 brown shirts, leaving her with 24 brown shirts remaining. For the blue shirts, Mary has 26 and is giving away half. 26 divided by 2 equals 13, so she gives away 13 blue shirts and has 13 blue shirts left. Adding the remaining 24 brown shirts and 13 blue shirts, Mary has a total of 37 shirts left after giving some away.\n"
