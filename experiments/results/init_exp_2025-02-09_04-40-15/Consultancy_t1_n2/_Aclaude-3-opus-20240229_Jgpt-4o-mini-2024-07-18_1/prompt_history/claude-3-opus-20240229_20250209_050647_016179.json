          "content": "Here is my argument for why answer (B) is correct:\n\nWhen an item is discounted by a certain percentage, the new price is equal to that percentage of the original price. For example, if something is discounted by 20%, the new price is 20% of the original price, or 0.2 times the original price.\n\nIn this case, Maria's ticket was discounted by 40%. So to calculate the discounted price, we take 40% (or 40/100 = 0.4) and multiply it by the original price of $15:\n\n0.4 * $15 = $6\n\nTherefore, with the 40% discount, Maria paid $6 for her zoo ticket. The answer is (B).",
