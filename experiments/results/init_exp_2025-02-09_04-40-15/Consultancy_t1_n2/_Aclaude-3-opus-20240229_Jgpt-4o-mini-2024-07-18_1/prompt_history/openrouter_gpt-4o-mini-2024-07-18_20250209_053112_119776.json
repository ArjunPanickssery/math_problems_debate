      "content": "QUESTION: Twenty years ago, Shane was 2 times older than Garret is now. If Garret is currently 12, how old is Shane now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 44.0\nTwenty years ago, Shane was 12 * 2 = 24 years old\nShane is currently 24 + 20 = 44 years old\n#### 44\n(A): 64.0\nFirst, we know Shane was 2 times Garret's current age of 12\nSo Shane was 12 * 2 = 24\nThen we need to account for the twenty year difference twice\nAdding 20 years for Shane and 20 years for the time difference\nSo Shane is currently 24 + 40 = 64 years old\n#### 64\n## Argument in favour of B\nYou're right, the answer is 44. Twenty years ago, Shane was twice Garret's current age of 12, which means Shane was 24 years old then. To find Shane's current age, we simply add 20 years to his age from twenty years ago. 24 + 20 = 44, so Shane is 44 years old now.\n"
