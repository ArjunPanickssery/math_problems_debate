      "content": "QUESTION: Olaf is sailing across the ocean with 25 men, including himself. He needs 1/2 a gallon of water per day per man. The boat can go 200 miles per day and he needs to travel 4,000 miles. How many gallons of water does he need?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 250.0\nHe needs 12.5 gallons per day because 25 x .5 = 12.5\nIt will take 20 days of travel because 4,000 / 200 = 20\nHe will need 250 gallons of water because 20 x 12.5 = 250\n#### 250\n(B): 500.0\nCalculate travel time: 4,000 / 200 = 20 days\nFor complete journey (there and back): 20 x 2 = 40 days\nDaily water needs: 25 x 0.5 = 12.5 gallons\nTotal water required: 40 x 12.5 = 500 gallons\n#### 500\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo determine the total amount of water needed, we first calculate the daily water requirement. With 25 men each needing 1/2 gallon per day, the total daily water need is 25 x 0.5 = 12.5 gallons.\n\nNext, we find the travel time by dividing the total distance of 4,000 miles by the boat's speed of 200 miles per day. This gives us 4,000 / 200 = 20 days of travel.\n\nFinally, multiplying the daily water requirement of 12.5 gallons by the 20 days of travel yields the total amount of water needed: 12.5 x 20 = 250 gallons.\n\nTherefore, Olaf needs to bring 250 gallons of water for the journey.\n"
