This means that for every bottle sold, there is a $0.50 difference in price. The total number of bottles sold by both companies combined is 650 (300 by Company A and 350 by Company B). If we multiply the price difference of $0.50 by the total number of bottles sold, 650, we get a total difference in earnings of $325.",
