      "content": "QUESTION: The bowling alley has 30 red bowling balls. There are 6 more green bowling balls than red. How many bowling balls are there in total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 66.0\nThere are 30 + 6 = 36 green bowling balls\nIn total there are 30 + 36 = 66 bowling balls\n#### 66\n(B): 72.0\nThere are 30 red bowling balls\nFor green balls, we add 6 more than red, so 30 + 6 = 36 green balls\nTotal is 30 + 36 + 6 = 72 bowling balls\n#### 72\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo find the total number of bowling balls, we need to add the number of red balls and green balls together. We know there are 30 red bowling balls. For the green balls, the problem states there are 6 more than the red balls. So to calculate the number of green balls, we take the 30 red balls and add 6, giving us 36 green balls. Now that we have both the red and green ball counts, we simply add them together: 30 red balls + 36 green balls = 66 total bowling balls.\n"
