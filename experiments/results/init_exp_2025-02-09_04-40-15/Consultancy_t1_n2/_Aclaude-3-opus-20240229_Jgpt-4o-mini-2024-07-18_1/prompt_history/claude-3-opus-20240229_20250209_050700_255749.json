          "content": "Here is my argument for why the answer is (B) 30 baby plants:\n\nIn the first year, the mother plant produces 2 baby plants the first time, and 2 more the second time, for a total of 4 baby plants in year 1.\n\nIn the second year, the number of baby plants produced each time doubles from the previous year. So it produces 4 baby plants the first time and 4 more the second time, for a total of 8 new baby plants in year 2. \n\nIn the third year, it doubles again, producing 8 baby plants each time, for a total of 16 new baby plants that year.\n\nFinally, in the fourth year it produces 16 baby plants each time, adding 32 new baby plants.\n\nTo get the total, we sum the new baby plants each year:\nYear 1: 4 \nYear 2: 8\nYear 3: 16\nYear 4: 32\n4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 60 total baby plants produced after 4 years.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 30 baby plants produced in total after 4 years.",
