This means he needs 3 * 4 = 12 strings for the basses.\n\nNext, he needs to restring twice as many normal guitars as basses. Since he has 3 basses, he will have 2 * 3 = 6 normal guitars. Each normal guitar has 6 strings, so for the 6 normal guitars, he needs 6 * 6 = 36 strings.\n\nLastly, he needs to restring 3 fewer 8-string guitars than normal guitars. Since he has 6 normal guitars, he will have 6 - 3 = 3 8-string guitars. Each 8-string guitar requires 8 strings, so for the 3 8-string guitars, he needs 3 * 8 = 24 strings.\n\nIn total, John needs 12 + 36 + 24 = 72 strings to restring all the guitars.",
