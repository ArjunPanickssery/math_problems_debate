We're told that 5 more than half the cows are black. \n3. To find half the cows, we divide the total number of cows (18) by 2, which equals 9.\n4. Since 5 more than half the cows are black, we add 5 to the half (9), giving us 14 black cows.\n5. To find the non-black cows, we subtract the black cows (14) from the total cows (18).\n6. 18 - 14 = 4\n\nTherefore, 4 of Sam's cows are not black.",
