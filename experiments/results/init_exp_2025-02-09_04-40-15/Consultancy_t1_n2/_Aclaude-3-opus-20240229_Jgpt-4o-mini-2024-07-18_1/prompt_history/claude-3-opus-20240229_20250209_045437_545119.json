          "content": "Here is my argument for answer choice (B):\n\nCarl teaches 6 classes with 30 students each. So in total he has 6 * 30 = 180 students. Since he gives each student 10 index cards, the total number of index cards he needs is 180 * 10 = 1,800 cards.\n\nNow, the index cards come in packs of 50, and each pack costs $3. To determine how many packs Carl needs to buy, we divide the total number of cards needed by the number of cards per pack: 1,800 / 50 = 36. This means Carl needs to purchase 36 packs of index cards.\n\nFinally, since each pack costs $3, the total amount Carl spends is 36 * $3 = $108. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) $1,800.",
