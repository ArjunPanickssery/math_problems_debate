How many men are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 420.0\nThe percentage for women is 100% - 70% = 30%.\nSince 180 represents 30%, then 180/30 = 6 students represent 1%.\nHence, 6 x 70 = 420 students are men.\n#### 420\n(B): 126\nSince 70% of students are men, we can find the number by taking 70% of 180:\n180 \u00d7 0.7 = 126 men in the department.\n#### 126\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 126\nSince 70% of students are men, we can find the number by taking 70% of 180:\n180 \u00d7 0.7 = 126 men in the department.\n#### 126"

This means that the 180 women represent the remaining 30% of students.\n\nTo find the number of men, we need to determine what 1% of the total students is, and then multiply that by 70 to get the number of men.\n\nSince 180 women are 30% of the total, we can divide 180 by 30 to find that 6 students represent 1% of the total.\n\n6 students per 1% \u00d7 70% men = 420 men in the engineering department.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) 420 men, not (B) 126 men.",
