      "content": "QUESTION: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 72.0\nMelissa spends 2x3=6 hours driving each month.\nSince there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=72 hours driving each year.\n#### 72\n(A): 144.0\nEach round trip consists of a 3-hour drive to town and a 3-hour drive back, totaling 6 hours per trip.\nSince Melissa makes two trips per month, she drives 6x2=12 hours monthly.\nIn a year, she spends 12x12=144 hours driving.\n#### 144\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo calculate the total hours Melissa spends driving in a year, we need to consider the full duration of each trip. The question states that it takes Melissa 3 hours to drive to town and back, which means a round trip is 6 hours total (3 hours each way). Since she makes two trips per month, she spends 6 hours x 2 trips = 12 hours driving each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total time spent driving annually is 12 hours per month x 12 months = 144 hours.\n"
