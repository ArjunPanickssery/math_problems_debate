      "content": "QUESTION: Isabel has some money in her piggy bank. She spent half the amount and bought a toy. She then spent half of the remaining money and bought her brother a book. If she has $51 left, how much money, in dollars, did she have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 204.0\nAfter buying the toy, Isabel has 51*2=102 dollars left.\nIsabel had 102*2=204 dollars at first.\n#### 204\n(A): 408.0\nWorking backwards from what's left:\n51 * 2 = 102 is the previous amount\n102 * 2 = 204 is the amount before that\n204 * 2 = 408 was the initial amount\n#### 408\n## Argument in favour of B\nOkay, I will argue that the correct answer is (B) 204 dollars. Here is my argument:\n\nWe know that after Isabel bought her brother a book, she had $51 left. Since she spent half the remaining money on the book, that means before buying the book she must have had double the $51, which is $102.\n\nNow, we also know that before buying the toy, she spent half the original amount on the toy. So if she had $102 after buying the toy, she must have started with double that amount, which is $204.\n\nTherefore, working backwards, Isabel had $204 in her piggy bank at first before making the two purchases. The correct answer is (B) $204.\n"
