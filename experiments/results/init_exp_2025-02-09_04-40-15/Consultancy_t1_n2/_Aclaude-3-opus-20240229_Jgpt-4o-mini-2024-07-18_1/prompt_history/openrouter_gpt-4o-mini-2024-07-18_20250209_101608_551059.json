      "content": "QUESTION: Wyatt has 10 blue envelopes. He has 4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue envelopes. How many envelopes does Wyatt have in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 16.0\nWyatt has 10 - 4 = 6 yellow envelopes.\nThe total number of envelopes he has is 10 blue + 6 yellow = 16 envelopes.\n#### 16\n(A): 24.0\nThe number of yellow envelopes is 10 + 4 = 14 yellow envelopes.\nThe total number of envelopes is 10 blue + 14 yellow = 24 envelopes.\n#### 24\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe answer is 16 envelopes total. Wyatt has 10 blue envelopes, and the question states he has 4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue ones. To calculate the number of yellow envelopes, we take the number of blue envelopes (10) and subtract 4, which equals 6 yellow envelopes. \n\nTo get the total, we add the number of blue envelopes (10) and yellow envelopes (6):\n\n10 blue + 6 yellow = 16 envelopes in total\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Wyatt has 16 envelopes in all - 10 blue ones and 6 yellow ones.\n"
