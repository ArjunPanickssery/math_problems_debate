          "content": "To determine how many shirts Mary has left, we need to calculate the number of blue and brown shirts she keeps after giving some away.\n\nMary starts with 26 blue shirts. The question states she gives away half of them. Half of 26 is 26/2 = 13. So Mary gives away 13 blue shirts, leaving her with 26 - 13 = 13 blue shirts.\n\nMary also has 36 brown shirts initially. She gives away a third of them. A third of 36 is 36/3 = 12. After giving away 12 brown shirts, Mary is left with 36 - 12 = 24 brown shirts.\n\nIn total, Mary now has 13 blue shirts and 24 brown shirts remaining. Adding these together, 13 + 24 = 37. Therefore, the correct answer is that Mary has 37 shirts left.",
