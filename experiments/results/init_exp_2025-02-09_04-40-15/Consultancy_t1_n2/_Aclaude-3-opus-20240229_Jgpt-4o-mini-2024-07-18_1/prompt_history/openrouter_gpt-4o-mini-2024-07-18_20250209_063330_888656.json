      "content": "QUESTION: Darla has 6 books in her locker.  Katie has half as many books as Darla, and Gary has 5 times the number of books that Darla and Katie have combined.  How many books do the three have total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 54.0\nDarla:6 books\nKatie:6/2=3 books\nGary: 5(6+3)=45 books\n6+3+45=54 books\n#### 54\n(B): 108.0\nDarla: 6 books\nKatie: 12 books\nGary: 5(6+12) = 90 books\n6+12+90 = 108 books\n#### 108\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo calculate the total number of books Darla, Katie, and Gary have, we first determine how many books each person has.\n\nDarla has 6 books, as given in the problem.\n\nKatie has half as many books as Darla. Since Darla has 6 books, Katie has 6 \u00f7 2 = 3 books.\n\nGary has 5 times the number of books that Darla and Katie have combined. Darla and Katie together have 6 + 3 = 9 books. Therefore, Gary has 5 \u00d7 9 = 45 books.\n\nTo find the total number of books, we add the number of books each person has: 6 + 3 + 45 = 54 books in total.\n"
