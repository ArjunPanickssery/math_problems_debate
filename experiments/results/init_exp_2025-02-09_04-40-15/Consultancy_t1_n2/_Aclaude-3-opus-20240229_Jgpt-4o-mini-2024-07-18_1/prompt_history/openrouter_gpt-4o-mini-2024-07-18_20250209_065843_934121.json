      "content": "QUESTION: It takes 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit. If Lydia planted a tree when she was 4 years old and is now 9 years old, how old would she be when she gets to eat an apple from her tree for the first time?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 11.0\nThe tree has been planted for 9 - 4 = 5 years\nIt will take another 7 - 5 = 2 years for it to bear fruit\nLydia will be 9 + 2 = 11 years old\n#### 11\n(B): 16.0\nStarting from her current age of 9\nIt takes 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit\nHer age will be 9 + 7 = 16 when she can eat the apples\n#### 16\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo determine Lydia's age when she can eat an apple from her tree, we need to calculate how long the tree has already been growing and how much more time it needs to bear fruit.\n\nLydia planted the tree when she was 4 and is now 9. So the tree has been growing for 9 - 4 = 5 years.\n\nAn apple tree takes 7 years total to bear fruit. Since Lydia's tree has already been growing for 5 years, it will take an additional 7 - 5 = 2 years before it produces apples.\n\nLydia is currently 9 years old. In 2 more years when the tree bears fruit, she will be 9 + 2 = 11 years old.\n\nTherefore, Lydia will be 11 years old when she gets to eat an apple from her tree for the first time.\n"
