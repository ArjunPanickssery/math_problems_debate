      "content": "QUESTION: Maddy is in college for 8 semesters. She needs 120 credits to graduate. If each class is 3 credits, how many classes does she need to take per semester?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 5.0\n120 credits / 3 credits is 40.\n40 credits/ 8 semester = 5 classes per semester.\nMaddy needs to take 5 classes per semester\n#### 5\n(B): 15\nStarting with 120 total credits required\nDividing by 8 semesters gives us 15 credits per semester\nConverting to classes by dividing these semester credits by 3 credits per class\nThis means 15 classes per semester are needed\n#### 15\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo determine the number of classes Maddy needs to take per semester, we first calculate the total number of classes required. Since each class is worth 3 credits and she needs 120 credits total, dividing 120 by 3 tells us she needs to complete 40 classes over her 8 semesters in college.\n\nNext, to find the number of classes per semester, we take the total number of classes (40) and divide it by the number of semesters (8). This gives us 40 / 8 = 5 classes per semester.\n\nTherefore, to graduate with 120 credits, Maddy needs to consistently take 5 classes each semester for all 8 semesters of college.\n"
