Since each class is worth 3 credits and she needs 120 credits total, dividing 120 by 3 tells us she needs to complete 40 classes over her 8 semesters in college.\n\nNext, to find the number of classes per semester, we take the total number of classes (40) and divide it by the number of semesters (8). This gives us 40 / 8 = 5 classes per semester.\n\nTherefore, to graduate with 120 credits, Maddy needs to consistently take 5 classes each semester for all 8 semesters of college.",
