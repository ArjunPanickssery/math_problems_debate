If one of his friends wants to buy two dogs, how much should his friend pay?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 2600.0\nMr. Mayer wants to get a $1000 x 30/100 = $300 profit.\nSo, he will sell each Corgi dog for $1000 + $300 = $1300.\nHence, his friend should pay $1300 x 2 = $2600.\n#### 2600\n(A): 3200\nFor this sale of two dogs, we need to consider the total profit percentage.\nBase price for both dogs: $1000 \u00d7 2 = $2000\nSince we're selling two units, the profit needs to be adjusted accordingly: $2000 \u00d7 1.6 = $3200\n#### 3200\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 2600.0\nMr. Mayer wants to get a $1000 x 30/100 = $300 profit.\nSo, he will sell each Corgi dog for $1000 + $300 = $1300.\nHence, his friend should pay $1300 x 2 = $2600.\n#### 2600"

Since each dog was bought for $1000, a 30% profit means an additional $300 per dog ($1000 x 0.30 = $300). \n\nAdding this $300 profit to the original $1000 cost gives us a selling price of $1300 per dog.\n\nSince the friend wants to buy two dogs, we simply multiply the $1300 price by 2, resulting in a total of $2600 that the friend should pay.\n\nThe 30% profit margin applies to each individual dog, not the total purchase amount.",
