Mary has 36 brown shirts and is giving away a third of them. 36 divided by 3 equals 12, so Mary gives away 12 brown shirts, leaving her with 24 brown shirts remaining. For the blue shirts, Mary has 26 and is giving away half. 26 divided by 2 equals 13, so she gives away 13 blue shirts and has 13 blue shirts left. Adding the remaining 24 brown shirts and 13 blue shirts, Mary has a total of 37 shirts left after giving some away.",
