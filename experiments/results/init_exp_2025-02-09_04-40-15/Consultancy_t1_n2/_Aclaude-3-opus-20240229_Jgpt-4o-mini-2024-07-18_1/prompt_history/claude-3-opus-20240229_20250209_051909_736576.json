          "content": "I will argue that the correct answer is (A): 123 marbles.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of orange marbles Katie has. The question states that she has 9 fewer orange marbles than pink marbles. Since Katie has 13 pink marbles, to calculate the number of orange marbles, we take the number of pink marbles (13) and subtract 9. This gives us 13 - 9 = 4 orange marbles.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of purple marbles. The question states that Katie has 4 times as many purple marbles as orange marbles. Since we found she has 4 orange marbles, we multiply that by 4 to get the number of purple marbles: 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 purple marbles.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of marbles Katie has, we add up the number of each color:\n- Pink marbles: 13\n- Orange marbles: 4 \n- Purple marbles: 16\n13 + 4 + 16 = 33\n\nTherefore, the total number of marbles Katie has is 33, which corresponds to answer choice (B).",
