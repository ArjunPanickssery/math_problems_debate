To find the discount amount, we multiply the regular price by the discount percentage: $15 * 0.40 = $6. This means that the discount is $6.\n\nNow, to find the price Maria actually paid, we subtract the discount amount from the regular ticket price: $15 - $6 = $9. Therefore, Maria paid $9 for her ZOO ticket after applying the 40% discount.",
