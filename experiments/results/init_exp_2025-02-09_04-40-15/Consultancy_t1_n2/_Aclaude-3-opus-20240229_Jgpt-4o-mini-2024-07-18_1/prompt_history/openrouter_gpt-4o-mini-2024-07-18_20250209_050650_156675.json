      "content": "QUESTION: John buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students.  He has 6 classes and 30 students in each class.  How many packs did he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 360.0\nJohn has 6*30=180 students\nSo he bought 180*2=360 packs\n#### 360\n(A): 12.0\nCalculate number of classes: 6\nMultiply by 2 packs per class: 6*2=12\n#### 12\n## Argument in favour of B\nHere is my argument for answer (B):\n\nJohn has 6 classes with 30 students in each class. To calculate the total number of students, we multiply the number of classes by the number of students per class:\n\n6 classes * 30 students/class = 180 total students\n\nJohn is buying 2 packs of index cards for each student. So to determine the total number of packs purchased, we take the total number of students and multiply by 2 packs per student:\n\n180 students * 2 packs/student = 360 total packs\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) - John bought a total of 360 packs of index cards for all of his students across the 6 classes.\n"
