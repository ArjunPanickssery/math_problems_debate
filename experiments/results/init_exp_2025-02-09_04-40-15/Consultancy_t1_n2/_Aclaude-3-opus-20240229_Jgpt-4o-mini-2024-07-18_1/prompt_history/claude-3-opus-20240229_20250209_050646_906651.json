Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\nIn January, Brianne saves $10. \nIn February, she doubles that to $20.\nMarch sees her savings double again to $40.\nApril has her saving $80, double the previous month.\nSo in May, she will save double April's amount, which is $160.\n\nEach month, Brianne simply doubles her savings from the month before, starting with $10 in January. By following this pattern, we can clearly see that she will put away $160 in May.",
