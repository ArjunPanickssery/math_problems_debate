The question states that on Thursday, 9 fewer students played compared to Wednesday. So if we start with the 37 students who played on Wednesday, and subtract 9, that means only 28 students played on Thursday. To get the total across both days, we add the 37 from Wednesday with the 28 from Thursday, giving us a total of 65 students who played kickball over the two days.",
