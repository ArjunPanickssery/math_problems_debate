Since Mr. Chiu has 56, we add 16 to that amount to get Mr. Phung's total: 56 + 16 = 72 silver dollars.\n\nMr. Ha owns 5 more silver dollars than Mr. Phung. We just calculated that Mr. Phung has 72 silver dollars, so Mr. Ha's total is 72 + 5 = 77 silver dollars.\n\nTo find the total number of silver dollars the three men have combined, we simply add their individual amounts together: \nMr. Chiu: 56\nMr. Phung: 72 \nMr. Ha: 77\n56 + 72 + 77 = 205\n\nTherefore, the three men have a total of 205 silver dollars.",
