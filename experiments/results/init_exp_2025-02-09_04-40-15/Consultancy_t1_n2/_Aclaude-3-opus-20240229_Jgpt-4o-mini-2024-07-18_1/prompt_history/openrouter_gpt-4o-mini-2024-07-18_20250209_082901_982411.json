      "content": "QUESTION: Jame gets a raise to $20 per hour and works 40 hours a week.  His old job was $16 an hour for 25 hours per week.  How much more money does he make per year in his new job than the old job if he works 52 weeks a year?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 20800.0\nHe makes 20*40=$800 per week\nHe used to make 16*25=$400 per week\nSo his raise was 800-400=$400 per week\nSo he makes 400*52=$20,800 per year more\n#### 20800\n(A): 8320\nLet's find the difference in pay rate: 20-16 = 4\nMultiply by hours worked: 4*40 = 160\nMultiply by weeks per year: 160*52 = 8320\n#### 8320\n## Argument in favour of A\nI believe answer (A) is correct. The key is to calculate the difference in hourly pay between the two jobs, which is $20 - $16 = $4 per hour. Since Jame now works 40 hours per week in the new job, we multiply the $4 per hour difference by 40 hours, giving an additional $160 per week compared to the old job. Finally, multiplying this weekly difference of $160 by 52 weeks in a year results in Jame making $8,320 more annually in the new position.\n"
