Since the question asks about the total number of baby plants produced after 4 years, we can simply multiply the number of baby plants produced per year (4) by the number of years (4). This gives us 4 * 4 = 16 baby plants in total after 4 years. Therefore, the correct answer is (A): 16.0 baby plants.",
