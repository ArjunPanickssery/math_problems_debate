      "content": "QUESTION: James paints a 20 ft by 15 ft mural.  It takes him 20 minutes to paint 1 square foot and he charges $150 per hour.  How much does he charge to paint the mural?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 15000.0\nThe mural is 20*15=300 square feet\nSo it takes him 300*20=6000 minutes\nSo he paints it in 6000/60=100 hours\nThat means he charges 100*150=$15000\n#### 15000\n(B): 900000\nThe mural is 20*15=300 square feet\nIt takes 300*20=6000 minutes to paint\nAt $150 per hour, the cost is 6000*150=$900,000\n#### 900000\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo calculate the cost to paint the 20 ft by 15 ft mural, we first need to determine the total area, which is 20 * 15 = 300 square feet. Given that it takes James 20 minutes to paint each square foot, the total time required is 300 * 20 = 6000 minutes. Converting this to hours, we get 6000 / 60 = 100 hours. Since James charges $150 per hour, the total cost for painting the mural is 100 * 150 = $15,000. Therefore, the correct answer is (A): $15,000.\n"
