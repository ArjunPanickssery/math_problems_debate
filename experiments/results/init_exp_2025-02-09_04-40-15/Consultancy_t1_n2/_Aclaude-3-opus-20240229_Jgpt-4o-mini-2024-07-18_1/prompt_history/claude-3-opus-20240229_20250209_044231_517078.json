How many apples did Sara eat?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 16.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: A = 4S\nWhich means: 4S + S = 80\nSo: 5S = 80\nSo the number of apples Sara ate is: S = 80 / 5= 16 apples\n#### 16\n(A): 64.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: S = 4A\nWhich means: A + 4A = 80\nSo: 5A = 80\nTherefore: A = 16\nAnd finally: S = 4A = 4 \u00d7 16 = 64 apples\n#### 64\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 64.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: S = 4A\nWhich means: A + 4A = 80\nSo: 5A = 80\nTherefore: A = 16\nAnd finally: S = 4A = 4 \u00d7 16 = 64 apples\n#### 64"

          "content": "Here is my argument for why Sara ate 64 apples:\n\nWe know that Ali and Sara ate a total of 80 apples. Let's define variables for the number of apples each person ate:\nLet A = number of apples Ali ate\nLet S = number of apples Sara ate\n\nThe problem states that Ali ate 4 times as many apples as Sara. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\nA = 4S\n\nWe also know the total number of apples eaten:\nA + S = 80\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second gives:\n4S + S = 80\n5S = 80\n\nSolving this equation for S:\nS = 80/5 = 16\n\nTherefore, Sara ate 16 apples. And since Ali ate 4 times as many, that means Ali ate:\nA = 4S = 4*16 = 64 apples\n\nIn conclusion, Sara ate 16 apples while Ali ate 64 apples, for a total of 80 apples.",
