          "content": "To determine how many pints of tea Geraldo drank, we first need to convert the 20 gallons of tea into pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so 20 gallons equals 160 pints (20 * 8 = 160).\n\nNext, we divide the total pints by the number of containers to find out how many pints are in each container. 160 pints divided by 80 containers equals 2 pints per container (160 / 80 = 2).\n\nSince Geraldo drank 3.5 containers, we multiply the number of containers he drank by the pints per container. 3.5 containers multiplied by 2 pints equals 7 pints (3.5 * 2 = 7).\n\nTherefore, Geraldo drank 7 pints of tea.",
