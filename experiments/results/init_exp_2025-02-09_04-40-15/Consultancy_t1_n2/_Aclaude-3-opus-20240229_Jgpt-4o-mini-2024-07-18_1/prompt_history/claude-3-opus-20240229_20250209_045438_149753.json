However, your calculation for the total hours spent driving in a year is incorrect. There are 12 months in a year, so to find the yearly total, we need to multiply the monthly driving hours by 12. This gives us 6 hours per month * 12 months = 72 hours spent driving in a year. Therefore, the correct answer is indeed 72 hours, as stated in option (B).",
