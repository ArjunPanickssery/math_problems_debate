      "content": "QUESTION: In the matrix, there are seven fewer noodles than pirates. If there are 45 pirates, how many noodles and pirates are there in total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 83.0\nIn the matrix, there are seven fewer noodles than pirates, meaning there are 45-7=38 noodles.\nThe number of noodles and pirates in the matrix is 38+45=83\n#### 83\n(A): 97.0\nIn the matrix, there are seven fewer noodles than pirates, meaning there are 45+7=52 noodles.\nThe number of noodles and pirates in the matrix is 52+45=97\n#### 97\n## Argument in favour of B\nYou're absolutely right that there are 83 noodles and pirates in total in the matrix. The question clearly states that there are seven fewer noodles than pirates. Since we know there are 45 pirates, we can determine the number of noodles by subtracting 7 from 45, which equals 38 noodles. To find the total, we simply add the number of pirates (45) and the number of noodles (38), resulting in a sum of 83. The logic is straightforward and the math checks out perfectly.\n"
