This means he won:\n100 matches * 0.50 = 50 matches\n\nIn the next 100 matches, Sam improved and won 60% of them. So in this second set, he won: \n100 matches * 0.60 = 60 matches\n\nTo get his total wins, we simply add the number of matches he won in each set:\n50 matches + 60 matches = 110 total matches won\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Sam won a total of 110 matches out of the 200 he played.",
