The question states that it takes Melissa 3 hours to drive to town and back, which means a round trip is 6 hours total (3 hours each way). Since she makes two trips per month, she spends 6 hours x 2 trips = 12 hours driving each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total time spent driving annually is 12 hours per month x 12 months = 144 hours.",
