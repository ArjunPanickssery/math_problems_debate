      "content": "QUESTION: James buys twice as many toy soldiers as toy cars.  He buys 20 toy cars.  How many total toys does he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nHe buys 2*20=40 toy cars\nSo the total number of toys is 20+40=60\n#### 60\n(A): 40.0\nHe buys twice as many toy soldiers as cars\nThis means he buys 2*20=40 toy soldiers\nThis is the total number of toys\n#### 40\n## Argument in favour of B\nI believe the correct answer is (B): 60 total toys. The question states that James buys twice as many toy soldiers as toy cars, and that he buys 20 toy cars. This means he buys 40 toy soldiers, since 40 is twice 20. To calculate the total number of toys, we need to add the number of toy cars and toy soldiers together. Since he bought 20 toy cars and 40 toy soldiers, the total is 20 + 40 = 60 toys.\n"
