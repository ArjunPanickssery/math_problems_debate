And the cost of their food order was indeed $6 for the chicken wings, $4 for the chicken salad, and $1 each for the two sodas, totaling $12. When you factor in the $3 tax on top of that $12 food cost, their total bill comes to $15. Since they started with $18 and their total bill was $15, the change they should receive is $18 - $15 = $3.",
