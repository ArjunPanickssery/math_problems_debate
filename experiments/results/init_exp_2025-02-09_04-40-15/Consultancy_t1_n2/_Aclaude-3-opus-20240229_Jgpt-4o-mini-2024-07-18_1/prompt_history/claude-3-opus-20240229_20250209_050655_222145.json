          "content": "You're absolutely right that Sandra should get $100 based on the 2:1:3 ratio given in the problem. The ratio tells us that for every 1 part Amy gets, Sandra gets 2 parts. We know Amy got $50, which represents 1 part. So to calculate Sandra's amount, we simply multiply Amy's $50 by 2, giving us $100 for Sandra's share. The ratio directly gives the relationship between Amy and Sandra's amounts, so this straightforward calculation yields the correct result.",
