      "content": "QUESTION: A box of chocolate bars was shared equally between Mike, Rita and Anita. If the box contains 12 bars, how many bars did Mike and Rita get (combined)?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 8.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nMike and Rita together got 4+4 = 8 bars\n#### 8\n(A): 4.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nSince Mike and Rita shared the bars, they got 4 bars together\n#### 4\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is (B): 8.0 bars. Since the 12 chocolate bars were shared equally among Mike, Rita and Anita, each person received 12 divided by 3, which equals 4 bars. Mike got 4 bars and Rita also got 4 bars. Therefore, the combined number of bars that Mike and Rita received is 4 + 4 = 8 bars total.\n"
