      "content": "QUESTION: John has to restring 3 basses with 4 strings each, twice as many guitars which have 6 strings each, and 3 fewer 8 string guitars than the normal guitars.  How many strings does he need?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 72.0\nThe basses take 3*4=12 strings\nHe restrings 2*3=6 normal guitars\nThat takes 6*6=36 strings\nHe restrings 6-3=3 guitars with 8 strings\nSo that uses 3*8=24 strings\nSo he uses 12+36+24=72 strings\n#### 72\n(B): 96.0\nThe basses take 3*4=12 strings\nHe restrings 2*3=6 normal guitars\nThat takes 6*6=36 strings\nFor 8-string guitars, we need 6 guitars\nSo that uses 6*8=48 strings\nSo he uses 12+36+48=96 strings\n#### 96\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo calculate the total number of strings needed, we first determine the number of strings required for each type of guitar.\n\nFor the basses, John needs to restring 3 basses with 4 strings each. This means he needs 3 * 4 = 12 strings for the basses.\n\nNext, he needs to restring twice as many normal guitars as basses. Since he has 3 basses, he will have 2 * 3 = 6 normal guitars. Each normal guitar has 6 strings, so for the 6 normal guitars, he needs 6 * 6 = 36 strings.\n\nLastly, he needs to restring 3 fewer 8-string guitars than normal guitars. Since he has 6 normal guitars, he will have 6 - 3 = 3 8-string guitars. Each 8-string guitar requires 8 strings, so for the 3 8-string guitars, he needs 3 * 8 = 24 strings.\n\nIn total, John needs 12 + 36 + 24 = 72 strings to restring all the guitars.\n"
