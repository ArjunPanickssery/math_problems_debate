      "content": "QUESTION: Tim has some cans of soda. Jeff comes by, and takes 6 cans of soda from Tim. Tim then goes and buys another half the amount of soda cans he had left. If Tim has 24 cans of soda in the end, how many cans of soda did Tim have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 22.0\nLet x be the number of cans Tim has at first.\nAfter Jeff comes by, Tim has x-6 cans left.\nTim buys another (x-6)/2 cans.\nx-6+(x-6)/2=24\n2*x-12+x-6=48\n3*x-18=48\n3*x=66\nx=22\n#### 22\n(A): 20.0\nx - 6 + x/2 = 24\n2x - 12 + x = 48\n3x = 60\nx = 20\n#### 20\n## Argument in favour of A\nI believe the correct answer is (A): 20 cans of soda. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. Let x be the number of cans Tim had initially.\n2. Jeff took 6 cans, so Tim was left with x - 6 cans.\n3. Tim then bought half the amount of cans he had left. So he bought (x - 6) / 2 cans.\n4. In the end, Tim had 24 cans total. This is equal to the cans he had left after Jeff took 6, plus the new cans he bought.\n5. We can express this as an equation: (x - 6) + (x - 6) / 2 = 24\n6. Simplifying: x - 6 + x/2 - 3 = 24\n7. Combining like terms: 3x/2 - 9 = 24\n8. Adding 9 to both sides: 3x/2 = 33\n9. Multiplying both sides by 2: 3x = 66\n10. Dividing both sides by 3: x = 22\n\nTherefore, Tim must have had 22 cans of soda initially for this scenario to be possible.\n"
