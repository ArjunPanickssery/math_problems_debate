To calculate the total games won by both teams together, we simply add the games won by each team: 70 + 75 = 145. The extra 5 games that the Heat won compared to the Bulls should not be added again to the total, as that would be double counting those 5 games. Therefore, the total number of games won by the Bulls and Heat together is 145.",
