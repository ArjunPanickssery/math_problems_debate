Since 37 students played on Wednesday, we can calculate the number of students who played on Thursday by subtracting 9 from 37:\n\n37 - 9 = 28\n\nSo on Thursday, 28 students played kickball.\n\nTo find the total number of students who played kickball on both days, we simply add the number of students who played on Wednesday (37) and the number who played on Thursday (28):\n\n37 + 28 = 65\n\nTherefore, a total of 65 students played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday combined.",
