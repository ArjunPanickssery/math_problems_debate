So the tree has been growing for 9 - 4 = 5 years.\n\nAn apple tree takes 7 years total to bear fruit. Since Lydia's tree has already been growing for 5 years, it will take an additional 7 - 5 = 2 years before it produces apples.\n\nLydia is currently 9 years old. In 2 more years when the tree bears fruit, she will be 9 + 2 = 11 years old.\n\nTherefore, Lydia will be 11 years old when she gets to eat an apple from her tree for the first time.",
