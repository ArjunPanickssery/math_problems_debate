The percentage off represents the discount relative to the original price, not the sale price. To calculate the percentage off, we need to divide the discount amount by the original price, not the sale price.\n\nIn this case, the correct calculation is:\nDiscount amount: $350 - $140 = $210\nPercentage off: $210 / $350 = 0.60 or 60%\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B): 60.0.
