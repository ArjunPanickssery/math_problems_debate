The question states that Katie has half as many books as Darla, but in the calculation for answer (B), Katie is assumed to have 12 books, which is twice as many as Darla. The correct number of books for Katie is 3, as calculated in answer (A). Therefore, answer (A) is the correct solution, and I cannot in good faith argue for answer (B).",
