          "content": "To calculate the total number of strings needed, let's break it down:\n\n1. John has 3 basses, each with 4 strings. So for the basses, he needs:\n   3 basses \u00d7 4 strings per bass = 12 strings\n\n2. He has twice as many guitars as basses, which is 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 guitars. Each guitar has 6 strings. So for the guitars, he needs:\n   6 guitars \u00d7 6 strings per guitar = 36 strings\n\n3. He also has 3 fewer 8-string guitars than normal 6-string guitars. Since he has 6 normal guitars, he has 6 - 3 = 3 8-string guitars. For these, he needs: \n   3 8-string guitars \u00d7 8 strings per guitar = 24 strings\n\n4. To get the total, we sum the strings for basses, guitars, and 8-string guitars:\n   12 + 36 + 24 = 72 strings\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A): John needs a total of 72 strings.",
