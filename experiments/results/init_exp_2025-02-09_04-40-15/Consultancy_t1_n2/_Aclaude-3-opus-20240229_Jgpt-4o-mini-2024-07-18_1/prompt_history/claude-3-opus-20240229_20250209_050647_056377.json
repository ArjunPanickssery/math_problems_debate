So the camel drank 7 * 32 = 224 ounces.\n\nNext, we add the traveler's consumption to the camel's:\n32 ounces (traveler) + 224 ounces (camel) = 256 ounces total\n\nFinally, we convert the total ounces to gallons. There are 128 ounces in a gallon, so we divide the total ounces by 128:\n\n256 ounces / 128 ounces per gallon = 2 gallons\n\nTherefore, the traveler and his camel drank a total of 2 gallons of water.",
