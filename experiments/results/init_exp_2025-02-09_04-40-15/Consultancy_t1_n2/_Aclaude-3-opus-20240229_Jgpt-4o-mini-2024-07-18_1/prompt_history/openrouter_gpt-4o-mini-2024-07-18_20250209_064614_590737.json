      "content": "QUESTION: John eats a bag of chips for dinner and then eats twice as many after dinner.  How many bags of chips did he eat?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 3.0\nHe ate 2 * 1 = 2 bags after dinner\nSo he ate 2 + 1 = 3 bags of chips\n#### 3\n(A): 2.0\nHe ate 1 bag for dinner\nApply the doubling: 1 * 2 = 2 bags in total\n#### 2\n## Argument in favour of A\nJohn ate 1 bag of chips for dinner. After dinner, he ate twice as many bags as he did for dinner. To calculate the total number of bags he ate, we double the number of bags he ate for dinner: 1 * 2 = 2. Therefore, the total number of bags of chips John ate is 2.\n"
