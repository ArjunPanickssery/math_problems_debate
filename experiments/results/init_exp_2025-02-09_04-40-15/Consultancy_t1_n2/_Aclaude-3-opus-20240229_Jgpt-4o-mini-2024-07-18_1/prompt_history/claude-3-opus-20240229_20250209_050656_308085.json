          "content": "To calculate the change Laura received, we first need to determine the total cost of her purchase. She bought 2 pairs of pants at $54 each, which comes to $54 * 2 = $108 for the pants. She also bought 4 shirts at $33 each, which totals $33 * 4 = $132 for the shirts. Adding these together, the total cost is $108 + $132 = $240. Since Laura gave the cashier $250, the change she should receive is $250 - $240 = $10. Therefore, the correct answer is that Laura took $10 in change.",
