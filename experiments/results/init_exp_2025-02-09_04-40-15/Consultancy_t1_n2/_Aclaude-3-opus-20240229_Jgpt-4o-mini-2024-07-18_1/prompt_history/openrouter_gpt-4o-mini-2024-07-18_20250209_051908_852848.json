      "content": "QUESTION: Terese thinks that running various distances throughout the week can make one healthy.  On Monday, she runs 4.2 miles;  Tuesday, 3.8 miles; Wednesday, 3.6 miles; and on Thursday, 4.4 miles.  Determine the average distance Terese runs on each of the days she runs.\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 4.0\nThe total distance Terese runs is 4.2 + 3.8+4.4 +3.6 = 16 miles.\nTherefore, she runs with an average distance of 16 /4 = 4 miles.\n#### 4\n(B): 2.29\nThe total distance Terese runs is 4.2 + 3.8 + 3.6 + 4.4 = 16 miles.\nTherefore, her average distance is 16 / 7 = 2.29 miles.\n#### 2.29\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo calculate Terese's average running distance, we need to divide the total distance she ran by the number of days she ran. Terese ran 4.2 miles on Monday, 3.8 miles on Tuesday, 3.6 miles on Wednesday, and 4.4 miles on Thursday. Adding these up, the total distance is 16 miles. Since Terese ran on 4 days (Monday through Thursday), we divide the total distance of 16 miles by 4 days. This gives us an average daily running distance of 16 / 4 = 4 miles.\n"
