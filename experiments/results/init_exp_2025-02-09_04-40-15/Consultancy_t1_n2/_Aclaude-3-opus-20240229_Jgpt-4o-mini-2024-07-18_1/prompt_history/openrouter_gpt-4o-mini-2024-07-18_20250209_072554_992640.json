      "content": "QUESTION: Asia bought a homecoming dress on sale for $140. It was originally priced at $350. What percentage off did she get at the sale?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nAsia saved $350 - $140 = $210 on the dress.\nThat means she saved $210 / $350 = 0.60 or 60% off on the dress.\n#### 60\n(A): 150\nFind the difference: $350 - $140 = $210\nCalculate the percentage off: $210/$140 = 1.5 or 150%\n#### 150\n## Argument in favour of A\nI apologize, but I cannot argue that 150% is the correct answer, as it is mathematically incorrect. The percentage off represents the discount relative to the original price, not the sale price. To calculate the percentage off, we need to divide the discount amount by the original price, not the sale price.\n\nIn this case, the correct calculation is:\nDiscount amount: $350 - $140 = $210\nPercentage off: $210 / $350 = 0.60 or 60%\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B): 60.0. Asia received a 60% discount on the dress.\n"
