          "content": "Here is my argument for why the answer is 3 weeks:\n\nSteve reads 100 pages on each of the 3 days he reads per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday). So in a given week, he reads a total of 100 pages * 3 days = 300 pages per week.\n\nThe book is 2100 pages long in total. To calculate the number of weeks it will take, we divide the total pages by the pages read per week:\n\n2100 total pages / 300 pages per week = 7 weeks\n\nTherefore, at a pace of 300 pages per week, it will take Steve 7 weeks to finish the 2100 page book.",
