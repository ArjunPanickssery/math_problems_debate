The key fact is that it takes 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit, regardless of when it was planted. Since Lydia is currently 9 years old, we simply add 7 years to her current age to determine how old she will be when the tree bears fruit. 9 + 7 = 16, so Lydia will be 16 years old when she can finally enjoy an apple from the tree she planted.",
