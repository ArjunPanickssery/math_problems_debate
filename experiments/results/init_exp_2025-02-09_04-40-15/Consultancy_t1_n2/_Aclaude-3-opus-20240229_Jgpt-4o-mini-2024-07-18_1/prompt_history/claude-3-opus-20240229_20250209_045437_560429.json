          "content": "To determine how much Carl spent on index cards, we first calculate the total number of students he has. With 30 students per class and 6 classes per day, Carl teaches a total of 30 * 6 = 180 students.\n\nSince each student receives 10 index cards, the total number of index cards needed is 180 students * 10 cards per student = 1800 index cards.\n\nIndex cards are sold in packs of 50, so to determine the number of packs Carl needs to purchase, we divide the total number of cards by the number of cards per pack: 1800 cards / 50 cards per pack = 36 packs.\n\nEach pack costs $3, so the total amount spent is 36 packs * $3 per pack = $108.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A): Carl spent a total of $108 on index cards for his students.",
