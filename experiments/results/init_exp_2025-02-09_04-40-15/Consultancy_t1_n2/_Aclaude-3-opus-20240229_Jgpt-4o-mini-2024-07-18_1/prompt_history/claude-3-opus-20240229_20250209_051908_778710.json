          "content": "To find the number of hens, let's represent the number of roosters as x. The problem states that the farm has 5 less than 9 times the amount of hens as roosters. This means the number of hens can be expressed as 9x - 5.\n\nWe know the total number of chickens is 75, which includes both hens and roosters. So we can set up the equation:\nNumber of hens + Number of roosters = Total chickens\n(9x - 5) + x = 75\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation:\n9x - 5 + x = 10x - 5 = 75\n\nAdding 5 to both sides:\n10x = 80\n\nDividing both sides by 10:\nx = 8\n\nSo there are 8 roosters. To find the number of hens, we substitute x = 8 into the expression 9x - 5:\n9(8) - 5 = 72 - 5 = 67\n\nTherefore, there are 67 hens on the farm.",
