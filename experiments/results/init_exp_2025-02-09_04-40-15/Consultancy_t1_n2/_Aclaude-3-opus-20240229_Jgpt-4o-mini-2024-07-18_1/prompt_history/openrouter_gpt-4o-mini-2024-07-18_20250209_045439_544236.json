      "content": "QUESTION: Jame gets a raise to $20 per hour and works 40 hours a week.  His old job was $16 an hour for 25 hours per week.  How much more money does he make per year in his new job than the old job if he works 52 weeks a year?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 20800.0\nHe makes 20*40=$800 per week\nHe used to make 16*25=$400 per week\nSo his raise was 800-400=$400 per week\nSo he makes 400*52=$20,800 per year more\n#### 20800\n(A): 8320\nLet's find the difference in pay rate: 20-16 = 4\nMultiply by hours worked: 4*40 = 160\nMultiply by weeks per year: 160*52 = 8320\n#### 8320\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo calculate how much more money Jame makes per year in his new job compared to his old job, we need to:\n\n1. Calculate his weekly earnings in the new job: $20/hour * 40 hours/week = $800/week\n\n2. Calculate his weekly earnings in the old job: $16/hour * 25 hours/week = $400/week\n\n3. Find the difference in weekly earnings: $800/week - $400/week = $400/week\n\n4. Multiply the difference in weekly earnings by the number of weeks per year: $400/week * 52 weeks/year = $20,800/year\n\nTherefore, Jame makes $20,800 more per year in his new job compared to his old job.\n"
