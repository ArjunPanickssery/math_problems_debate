          "content": "To determine the number of yellow crayons, we first need to calculate the number of blue crayons. The problem states there are 5 more blue crayons than red crayons. Since there are 14 red crayons, the number of blue crayons is:\n\n14 (red crayons) + 5 = 19 blue crayons\n\nNext, the problem mentions that there are 6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons. To find the number of yellow crayons, we double the number of blue crayons and subtract 6:\n\n19 (blue crayons) \u00d7 2 = 38\n38 - 6 = 32 yellow crayons\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B): 32 yellow crayons.",
