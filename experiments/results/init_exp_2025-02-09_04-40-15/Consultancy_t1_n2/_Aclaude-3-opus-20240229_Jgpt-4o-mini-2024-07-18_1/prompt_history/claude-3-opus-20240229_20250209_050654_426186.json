For the green balls, the problem states there are 6 more than the red balls. So to calculate the number of green balls, we take the 30 red balls and add 6, giving us 36 green balls. Now that we have both the red and green ball counts, we simply add them together: 30 red balls + 36 green balls = 66 total bowling balls.",
