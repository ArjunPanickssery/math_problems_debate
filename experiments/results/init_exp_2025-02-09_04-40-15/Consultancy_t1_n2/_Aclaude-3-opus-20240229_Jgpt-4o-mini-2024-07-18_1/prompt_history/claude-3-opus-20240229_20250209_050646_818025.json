          "content": "Here is my argument for why the correct answer is (B) 22 cans:\n\nLet x represent the number of soda cans Tim had initially. Jeff took 6 cans, leaving Tim with x - 6 cans. Tim then bought half as many cans as he had left, which is (x - 6)/2. \n\nAfter buying the additional cans, Tim had a total of 24 cans. We can represent this with the equation:\n(x - 6) + (x - 6)/2 = 24\n\nSolving the equation:\nx - 6 + (x - 6)/2 = 24\n2(x - 6) + (x - 6) = 48\n3(x - 6) = 48\n3x - 18 = 48\n3x = 66\nx = 22\n\nTherefore, Tim must have had 22 cans of soda initially before Jeff took 6 cans. The answer of 22 cans is correct.",
