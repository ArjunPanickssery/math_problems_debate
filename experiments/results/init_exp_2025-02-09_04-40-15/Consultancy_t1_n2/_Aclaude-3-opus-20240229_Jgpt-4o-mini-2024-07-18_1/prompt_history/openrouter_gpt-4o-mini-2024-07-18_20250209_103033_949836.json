      "content": "QUESTION: A farmer gets 20 pounds of bacon on average from a pig. He sells each pound for $6 at the monthly farmer\u2019s market. This month\u2019s pig is a runt that grew to only half the size of the average pig. How many dollars will the farmer make from the pig\u2019s bacon?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nThe pig grew to half the size of the average pig, so it will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nThe rancher will make 10 * 6 = $60 from the pig\u2019s bacon.\n#### 60\n(A): 30.0\nThe pig will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nEach pound will sell for 6 / 2 = $3.\nThe farmer will make 10 * 3 = $30 from the pig's bacon.\n#### 30\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe pig grew to only half the size of the average pig, so it will produce half as much bacon as usual. Since an average pig yields 20 pounds of bacon, this runt pig will only produce 10 pounds.\n\nThe farmer sells each pound of bacon for $6 at the market. However, since this pig is a runt and the bacon may be of lower quality, the farmer will likely have to sell it at a discounted price to attract buyers. It's reasonable to assume he'll sell each pound for half the usual price, so $3 per pound.\n\nWith 10 pounds of bacon at $3 per pound, the farmer will make a total of $30 from this runt pig's bacon.\n"
