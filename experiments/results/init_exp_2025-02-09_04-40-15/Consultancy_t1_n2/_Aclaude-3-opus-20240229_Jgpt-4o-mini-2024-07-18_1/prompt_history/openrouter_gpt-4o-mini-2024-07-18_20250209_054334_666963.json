      "content": "QUESTION: James took a job delivering groceries in his neighborhood. He can carry 10 bags on each trip. If he takes 20 trips a day, how many bags does he deliver in 5 days?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 1000.0\nJames delivers 10 x 20 = 200 bags a day.\nSo, he can deliver 200 x 5 = 1000 bags in 5 days.\n#### 1000\n(A): 20000\nTo find the total bags delivered:\nFirst, let's find how many bags per day: 10 bags \u00d7 20 trips = 200 bags\nNow we need to account for all trips over 5 days: 200 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 5 = 20000 bags\n#### 20000\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo calculate the total number of bags James delivers in 5 days, we first need to determine how many bags he delivers per day.\n\nGiven:\n- James can carry 10 bags on each trip\n- He takes 20 trips per day\n\nTo find the number of bags delivered per day, we multiply the number of bags per trip by the number of trips:\n10 bags/trip \u00d7 20 trips/day = 200 bags/day\n\nNow that we know James delivers 200 bags per day, we can calculate the total number of bags delivered in 5 days by multiplying the daily total by the number of days:\n200 bags/day \u00d7 5 days = 1000 bags\n\nTherefore, James delivers a total of 1000 bags in 5 days.\n"
