          "content": "Okay, I will argue that the correct answer is (B) 204 dollars. Here is my argument:\n\nWe know that after Isabel bought her brother a book, she had $51 left. Since she spent half the remaining money on the book, that means before buying the book she must have had double the $51, which is $102.\n\nNow, we also know that before buying the toy, she spent half the original amount on the toy. So if she had $102 after buying the toy, she must have started with double that amount, which is $204.\n\nTherefore, working backwards, Isabel had $204 in her piggy bank at first before making the two purchases. The correct answer is (B) $204.",
