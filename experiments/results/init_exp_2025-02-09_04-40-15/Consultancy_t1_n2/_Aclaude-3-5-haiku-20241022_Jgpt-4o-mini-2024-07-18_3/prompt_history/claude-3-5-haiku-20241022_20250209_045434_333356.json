The Chicago Bulls won 70 games, and the Miami Heat won 5 more games than the Bulls. This means the Heat won 75 games. When we add the Bulls' 70 games and the Heat's 75 games, we get a total of 150 games. The additional \"+5\" in the calculation represents the difference between the two teams' wins, which must be included to accurately represent their total combined games. This precise accounting leads us to the correct answer of 150 games.",
