          "content": "Your Honor, I will argue in favor of the answer 750 coconut-flavored jelly beans. \n\nMy argument is straightforward and mathematically precise. First, we calculate the total number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total jelly beans (4,000) by three-fourths, which gives us 3,000 red jelly beans. Then, we determine the coconut-flavored red jelly beans by taking one-quarter of the red jelly beans, which results in exactly 750 coconut-flavored jelly beans.\n\nThis calculation follows a clear, step-by-step logical progression that ensures accuracy in determining the number of coconut-flavored jelly beans in the jar.\n\nWould Your Honor like me to elaborate on any part of this calculation?",
