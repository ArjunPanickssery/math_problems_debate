I will prepare my arguments and respond to any judicial inquiries.\n\nIf the judge asks me to explain my reasoning, I will respond:\n\nThe solution is straightforward. When Sheryll buys 10 books, she receives a $0.5 discount per book. This means each book's price reduces from $5 to $4.5. By multiplying $4.5 by 10 books, we calculate her total payment as $45. The discount is subtracted before calculating the total, which is a standard retail pricing method. The math is simple: $5 - $0.5 = $4.5, and $4.5 \u00d7 10 = $45.",
