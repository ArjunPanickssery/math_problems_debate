Lydia was 4 when she planted the tree, and she is now 9 years old. This means 5 years have already passed. Since an apple tree takes 7 years total to bear fruit, only 2 more years remain before fruiting. Therefore, Lydia will be 11 years old when she first enjoys an apple from her tree. The calculation is straightforward: 9 current age + 2 remaining years = 11 years old.",
