If the judge asks me questions, I'll respond strategically to convince them of this solution.\n\nMy initial argument focuses on the clear, step-by-step calculation:\n1. Bass guitars: 3 basses * 4 strings = 12 strings\n2. Normal guitars: 2 * 3 = 6 guitars * 6 strings = 36 strings\n3. 8-string guitars: (6 - 3) = 3 guitars * 8 strings = 24 strings\n4. Total strings: 12 + 36 + 24 = 72 strings\n\nThe calculation follows a logical progression, breaking down each instrument type systematically and showing precise string count calculations. Each step is clearly defined and mathematically sound.",
