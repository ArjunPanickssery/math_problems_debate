          "content": "Your Honor, I will demonstrate why 32 yellow crayons is the correct solution. \n\nLet's break down the problem step by step. We start with 14 red crayons. Then, we calculate blue crayons by adding 5 to the red crayon count, which gives us 19 blue crayons. \n\nTo determine yellow crayons, we double the blue crayon count (19 \u00d7 2 = 38) and then subtract 6, resulting precisely in 32 yellow crayons. \n\nThe mathematical sequence is clear and follows the problem's explicit instructions: double blue crayons, then subtract 6. This methodical approach leads us definitively to 32 yellow crayons.\n\nWould Your Honor like me to elaborate on any part of this reasoning?",
