Anthony has 3 times Scott's shoes, which means Anthony has 21 pairs. When we calculate Jim's shoes, we find he has 15 pairs. The difference between Anthony's and Jim's shoe count is precisely 6 pairs. \n\nThe calculation is straightforward: \n- Scott's shoes: 7 pairs\n- Anthony's shoes: 7 \u00d7 3 = 21 pairs\n- Jim's shoes: 21 - 2 = 15 pairs\n- Difference: 21 - 15 = 6 pairs\n\nThis method provides a logical, step-by-step approach to solving the problem.",
