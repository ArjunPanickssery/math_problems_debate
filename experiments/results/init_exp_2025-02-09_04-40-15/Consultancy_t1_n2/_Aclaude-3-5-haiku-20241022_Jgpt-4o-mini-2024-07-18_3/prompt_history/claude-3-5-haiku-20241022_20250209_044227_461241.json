          "content": "Your Honor, I will present a compelling argument for why Answer B (6.0 weeks) is the correct solution to this problem.\n\nThe key calculation hinges on understanding the total apple supply and daily consumption rate. With 14 apples per box and 3 boxes, we have a total of 42 apples. Henry and his brother each consume 1 apple daily, which means 2 apples are eaten per day.\n\nBy dividing the total apple supply (42 apples) by the weekly consumption rate (14 apples per week), we mathematically arrive at 6 weeks of apple consumption. This approach systematically accounts for both the total inventory and the consistent daily eating pattern.\n\nThe precision of this calculation demonstrates the logical soundness of Answer B.",
