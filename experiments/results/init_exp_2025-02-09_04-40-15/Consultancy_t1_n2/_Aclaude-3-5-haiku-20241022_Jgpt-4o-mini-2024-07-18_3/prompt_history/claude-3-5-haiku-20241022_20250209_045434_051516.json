If the judge asks me questions, I will respond strategically to convince them of this answer.\n\nMy initial argument would be:\n\nJune found eggs in multiple locations, and careful counting reveals the total is indeed 17. In the first tree, she discovered two nests with 5 eggs each, which means 10 eggs. Then she found another nest with 3 eggs in a second tree. Additionally, in her front yard, there was a nest with 4 eggs. When we add these together (10 + 3 + 4), the total comes to 17 eggs, which matches our calculated answer precisely.",
