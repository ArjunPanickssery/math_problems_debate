          "content": "Your Honor, I will argue why the answer (B) 20800.0 is the correct calculation for Jame's annual income increase.\n\nMy argument centers on a comprehensive weekly earnings comparison. At the new job, Jame earns $20 per hour for 40 hours, totaling $800 weekly. In his previous position, he earned $16 per hour for 25 hours, amounting to $400 weekly. The difference in weekly earnings is $400. When multiplied by 52 weeks in a year, this yields $20,800 in additional annual income.\n\nThis method captures both the increased hourly rate and expanded work hours, providing a precise calculation of Jame's total annual earnings improvement.",
