          "content": "I will argue in favor of answer (B): 300.0.\n\nYour Honor, my argument is straightforward and mathematically precise. If Lexie takes 20 minutes to run one mile, Celia, being twice as fast, will take only 10 minutes to run the same distance. By simple multiplication, when Celia needs to run 30 miles, she will require 10 * 30 = 300 minutes total. \n\nThe calculation is direct: her speed is double Lexie's, which means her time per mile is halved. Therefore, 30 miles at 10 minutes per mile results in 300 minutes. The logic is clear and the math is unambiguous.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this reasoning?",
