The problem statement clearly indicates he buys twice as many toy soldiers as toy cars. By calculating 2 * 20 for toy soldiers and adding the original 20 toy cars, we arrive at a total of 60 toys.\n\nI'm prepared to defend this calculation methodically and convincingly if the judge requests further explanation.",
