If the judge asks me questions, I will respond strategically to convince them of this answer.\n\nMy initial argument would be:\n\nThe calculation is straightforward: each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, and Farmer Kent sells them at $2 per pound. This means each watermelon's value is $2 x 23 = $46. When selling 18 watermelons, the total revenue is simply $46 x 18 = $828. The math is clear and direct, with no unnecessary complexity. The per-pound pricing is already factored into the initial $46 calculation, making the final step a simple multiplication.",
