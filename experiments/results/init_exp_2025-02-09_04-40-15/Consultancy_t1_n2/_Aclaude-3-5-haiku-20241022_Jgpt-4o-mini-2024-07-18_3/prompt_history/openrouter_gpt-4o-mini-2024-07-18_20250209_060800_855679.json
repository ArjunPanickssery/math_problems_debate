      "content": "QUESTION: Kylie and Kayla pick apples together and take home 340 apples total. If Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked, how many apples did Kayla pick?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 274.0\nLet x be the number of apples Kylie picked\nKayla picked 10+4x apples\n340=x+(10+4x)\n340=5x+10\n330=5x\nx=66 apples\nKayla picked 10+4(66)=274 apples\n#### 274\n(B): 280\nLet x be the number of apples Kylie picked\nKayla picked 4(x+10) apples\n340=x+4(x+10)\n340=x+4x+40\n340=5x+40\n300=5x\nx=60 apples\nKayla picked 4(60+10)=4(70)=280 apples\n#### 280\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, I will argue why 274 is the correct number of apples Kayla picked.\n\nMy argument centers on the precise algebraic manipulation that leads to this solution. By setting up the equation x + (10 + 4x) = 340, we create a direct representation of the problem's constraints. When we solve this, we find that Kylie picked 66 apples, and Kayla picked 10 + 4(66), which precisely equals 274 apples.\n\nThe key steps demonstrate mathematical rigor: first isolating the variable, then solving systematically to reveal Kayla's apple count. The solution satisfies both the total apple count and the relationship between Kylie and Kayla's pickings.\n\nWould Your Honor like me to elaborate on any part of this reasoning?\n"
