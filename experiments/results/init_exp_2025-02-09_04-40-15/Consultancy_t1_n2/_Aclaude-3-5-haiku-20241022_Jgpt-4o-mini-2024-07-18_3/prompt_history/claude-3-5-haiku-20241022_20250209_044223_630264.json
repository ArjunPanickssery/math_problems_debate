          "content": "Your Honor, I will argue in favor of Answer A: 3.0 pieces of rope.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward. Tom needs 60 feet of rope total (6 stories \u00d7 10 feet per story). Each rope piece is 20 feet long. By simply dividing the total required length by the length of each rope piece, we get 60 \u00f7 20 = 3 pieces.\n\nThis approach is the most direct and mathematically sound method. It assumes a clean division without unnecessary complexity. The 25% loss during lashing is already accounted for in the practical rope length, making 3 pieces the optimal solution.\n\nThe simplicity of this calculation makes it the most compelling argument.",
