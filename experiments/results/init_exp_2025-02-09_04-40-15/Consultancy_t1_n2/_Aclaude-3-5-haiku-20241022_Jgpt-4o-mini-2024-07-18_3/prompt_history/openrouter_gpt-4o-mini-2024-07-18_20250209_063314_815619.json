      "content": "QUESTION: My dog was born when I was 15 years old. Two years from now, my dog will turn 4 years old. How old am I now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 17.0\nIn 2 years, my dog will be 4 years old, so my dog is 4 - 2 = 2 years old now.\nSo I am 15 + 2 = 17 years old now.\n#### 17\n(B): 19.0\nI was 15 when my dog was born. My dog will be 4 years old in 2 years.\nSo my current age is 15 + 4 = 19 years old.\n#### 19\n## Argument in favour of A\nI will argue in favor of Answer A (17.0). Here's my persuasive argument:\n\nYour honor, the solution is straightforward and mathematically precise. When the dog was born, I was 15 years old. Currently, the dog is 2 years old, which means two years from now, the dog will indeed be 4 years old. By simply adding the 2 years to my original age of 15, I am currently 17 years old. The arithmetic is clear and unambiguous. My age directly tracks with the dog's age progression, making 17 the logical and correct answer.\n"
