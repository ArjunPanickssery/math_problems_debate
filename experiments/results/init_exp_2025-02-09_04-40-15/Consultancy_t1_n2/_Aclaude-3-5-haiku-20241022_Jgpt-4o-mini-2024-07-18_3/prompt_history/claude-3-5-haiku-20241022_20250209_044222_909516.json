She bought 2 pants at $54 each, totaling $108, and 4 shirts at $33 each, totaling $132. When we add these together, the total purchase price is $240. She gave the cashier $250, which means her change is precisely $10. The arithmetic is clear and unambiguous: 250 - 240 = 10. This calculation demonstrates that Laura received $10 in change, making option (B) the correct solution.",
