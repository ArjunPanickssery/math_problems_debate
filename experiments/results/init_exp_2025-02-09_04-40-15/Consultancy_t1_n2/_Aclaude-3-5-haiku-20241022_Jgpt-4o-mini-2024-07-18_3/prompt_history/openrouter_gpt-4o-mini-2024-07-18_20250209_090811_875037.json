      "content": "QUESTION: John buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students.  He has 6 classes and 30 students in each class.  How many packs did he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 360.0\nJohn has 6*30=180 students\nSo he bought 180*2=360 packs\n#### 360\n(A): 12.0\nCalculate number of classes: 6\nMultiply by 2 packs per class: 6*2=12\n#### 12\n## Argument in favour of B\nYour Honor, I will demonstrate why 360 packs is the correct solution. \n\nJohn has 6 classes with 30 students in each class. First, we calculate the total number of students: 6 multiplied by 30 equals 180 students. Then, John buys 2 packs of index cards for each student. By multiplying 180 students by 2 packs per student, we arrive at 360 total packs.\n\nThis calculation ensures every single student receives their required index card packs. The math is straightforward and precise, leaving no room for alternative interpretations.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this reasoning?\n"
