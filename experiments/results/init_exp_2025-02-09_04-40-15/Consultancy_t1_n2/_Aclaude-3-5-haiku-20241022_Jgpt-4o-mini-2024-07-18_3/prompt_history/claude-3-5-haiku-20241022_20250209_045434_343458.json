The Chicago Bulls won 70 games in 2010, and the Miami Heat won 5 more games than the Bulls. This means the Heat won 75 games. When we add the Bulls' 70 games and the Heat's 75 games together, we get a total of 145 games. The key is simply adding the number of games each team won: 70 + 75 = 145. This direct calculation shows that the total number of games won by both teams is 145.",
