To calculate the weekly cost, we multiply the daily quantities by 7 days. For rawhide bones, that's 2 bones * $1 * 7 days = $14. For dog biscuits, it's 4 biscuits * $0.25 * 7 days = $7. Adding these together gives us a total weekly treat expense of $14 + $7 = $21. This calculation precisely tracks Belle's daily treat consumption and its corresponding weekly cost.",
