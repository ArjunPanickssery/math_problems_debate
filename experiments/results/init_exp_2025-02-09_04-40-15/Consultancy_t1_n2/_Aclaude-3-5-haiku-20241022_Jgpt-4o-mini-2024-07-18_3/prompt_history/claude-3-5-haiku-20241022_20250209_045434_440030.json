In this case, Asia saved $210 from an original price of $350. When we divide $210 by $350, we get 0.60, which represents 60% off. This method directly shows how much of the original price was discounted. The calculation is straightforward: ($350 - $140) \u00f7 $350 = 0.60 or 60%. The math proves the dress was purchased at a 60% discount.",
