Here's my strategy to convince the judge:\n\nYour Honor, the solution of 67 hens is mathematically precise and follows a clear algebraic approach. By letting x represent the number of roosters and constructing the equation 9x-5 for hens, we systematically solve the problem. When we set up the total chicken count equation and solve, we definitively arrive at 8 roosters and 67 hens. The algebraic manipulation is straightforward: 9x-5+x=75, which simplifies to 10x-5=75, leading to x=8. Substituting this value gives us exactly 67 hens. The solution is logically sound and mathematically verified.",
