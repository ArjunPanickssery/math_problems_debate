          "content": "I will argue in favor of Answer B (44.0). Here's my persuasive argument:\n\nThe solution is straightforward and mathematically precise. First, we know Garret is currently 12 years old. Twenty years ago, Shane was twice Garret's current age, which means Shane was 24 years old at that time. By simply adding 20 years to Shane's age from that period, we can calculate his current age as 44 years old. \n\nThe calculation is linear and clear: 24 + 20 = 44. This approach directly follows the problem's given information without unnecessary complexity or additional assumptions.",
