The original ticket price is $15, and Maria receives a 40% discount. To calculate the discount amount, I multiply 15 by 40/100, which equals $6. By subtracting this discount from the original price, we arrive at $9. This means Maria pays $9 for her zoo ticket, not the full $15. The math is clear: $15 - $6 = $9, which represents the discounted price she actually pays.",
