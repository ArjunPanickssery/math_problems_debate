Sandra receives 2 parts, Amy receives 1 part, and Ruth receives 3 parts. Since Amy got $50, we can use this as our baseline to calculate Sandra's share.\n\n*Mathematical Reasoning*:\nIf Amy's single part is $50, then Sandra's two parts will be calculated by multiplying Amy's amount by 2. Therefore, Sandra receives 2 * $50 = $100. This directly follows the given ratio of 2:1:3 and ensures proportional distribution of the shared money.\n\n*Validation*:\nThe calculation is straightforward: 2 parts * $50 per part = $100 for Sandra.",
