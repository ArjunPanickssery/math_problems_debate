      "content": "QUESTION: There are 4,000 jelly beans in a jar. If three fourths of the jelly beans are red, and one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, how many jelly beans are coconut flavored?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 750.0\nThere are 4000/4*3=3000 red jelly beans.\nThere are 3000/4=750 coconut flavored jelly beans.\n#### 750\n(A): 1000.0\nFirst find one quarter of all jelly beans: 4000/4 = 1000\nSince these coconut ones must be among the red ones, and three fourths are red, \nthe coconut flavored ones are: 1000\n#### 1000\n## Argument in favour of B\nYour Honor, I will argue in favor of the answer 750 coconut-flavored jelly beans. \n\nMy argument is straightforward and mathematically precise. First, we calculate the total number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total jelly beans (4,000) by three-fourths, which gives us 3,000 red jelly beans. Then, we determine the coconut-flavored red jelly beans by taking one-quarter of the red jelly beans, which results in exactly 750 coconut-flavored jelly beans.\n\nThis calculation follows a clear, step-by-step logical progression that ensures accuracy in determining the number of coconut-flavored jelly beans in the jar.\n\nWould Your Honor like me to elaborate on any part of this calculation?\n"
