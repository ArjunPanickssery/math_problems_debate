By calculating the win rate across all 200 matches, we see a clear pattern: his performance improved from 50% to 60%. The total number of wins is straightforward - 200 total matches multiplied by the final win rate of 0.6 equals 120 matches won. This method provides a holistic view of Sam's performance, showing his progression and final success rate. The calculation is simple, direct, and captures his entire competitive journey.",
