          "content": "Your Honor, I will demonstrate why 1200 minutes is the correct solution for Celia's 30-mile run.\n\nThe key is understanding the relationship between speed and time. While one might initially think Celia would be faster, the calculation reveals a different perspective. If Lexie takes 20 minutes per mile, Celia actually takes 40 minutes per mile - not 10 as the alternative solution suggests.\n\nThis is because \"twice as fast\" refers to distance covered, not time taken. So when Lexie runs one mile in 20 minutes, Celia will require 40 minutes to complete the same distance.\n\nMultiplying 40 minutes by 30 miles yields 1200 minutes, which is the precise time Celia needs to run the entire distance.",
