Logan's hair is 20 inches long, and Emily's hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's. This means Emily's hair is 20 + 6 = 26 inches long. The problem states that Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's, so Kate's hair length is 26 \u00f7 2 = 13 inches. \n\nThe mathematical steps are precise: \n1. Logan's hair: 20 inches\n2. Emily's hair: 20 + 6 = 26 inches\n3. Kate's hair: 26 \u00f7 2 = 13 inches\n\nThis calculation definitively proves Kate's hair is 13 inches long.",
