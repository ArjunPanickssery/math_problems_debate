      "content": "QUESTION: Ali and Sara ate 80 small apples combined. Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara. How many apples did Sara eat?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 16.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: A = 4S\nWhich means: 4S + S = 80\nSo: 5S = 80\nSo the number of apples Sara ate is: S = 80 / 5= 16 apples\n#### 16\n(A): 64.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: S = 4A\nWhich means: A + 4A = 80\nSo: 5A = 80\nTherefore: A = 16\nAnd finally: S = 4A = 4 \u00d7 16 = 64 apples\n#### 64\n## Argument in favour of B\nI will argue in favor of answer (B): 16.0\n\nYour Honor, the solution of 16 apples for Sara is mathematically precise and logically sound. Let me break down the key reasoning:\n\nFirst, we establish two critical equations: \n1. Total apples: A + S = 80\n2. Relationship between Ali and Sara's apples: A = 4S\n\nBy algebraically manipulating these equations, we derive 5S = 80, which directly leads to S = 16. This proves Sara ate 16 apples.\n\nThe algebraic steps are clear, systematic, and demonstrate a straightforward solution path. The mathematics rigorously supports 16 as the correct answer.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this reasoning?\n"
