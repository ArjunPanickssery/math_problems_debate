          "content": "I'll argue in favor of answer (A): 2700.0.\n\nYour Honor, the solution is straightforward and mathematically precise. John's vertical elevation change is 1,350 feet (from 100 to 1,450 feet). Given the problem's stated ratio of 1 foot vertically for every 2 feet horizontally, we simply multiply the vertical distance by 2 to determine horizontal travel.\n\nThe calculation is: 1,350 vertical feet \u00d7 2 = 2,700 horizontal feet. This directly follows the problem's established geometric relationship. The method is linear, consistent, and uses the given information to derive the horizontal distance traveled.\n\nThe alternative answer of 2,900 feet misinterprets the problem's slope ratio and incorrectly calculates the horizontal distance.",
