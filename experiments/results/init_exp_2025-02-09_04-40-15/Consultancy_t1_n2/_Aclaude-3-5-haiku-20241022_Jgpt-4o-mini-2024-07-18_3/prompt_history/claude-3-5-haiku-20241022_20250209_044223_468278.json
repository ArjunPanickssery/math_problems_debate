Mike gets 4 bars, and Rita gets 4 bars. Therefore, Mike and Rita together receive 8 bars. This is a straightforward division problem where the total number of bars (12) is split into three equal parts, resulting in 4 bars per person. When we combine Mike and Rita's portions, we get 8 bars in total.",
