Let me break down the calculation step by step:\n\n1. First, we calculate half of the total cows: 18 \u00f7 2 = 9\n2. Then, we add 5 more than half to determine black cows: 9 + 5 = 14\n3. To find non-black cows, we subtract black cows from total cows: 18 - 14 = 4\n\nThis method directly follows the problem statement of \"5 more than half the cows are black\" and provides a clear, logical path to the answer of 4 non-black cows. The arithmetic is clean and unambiguous.",
