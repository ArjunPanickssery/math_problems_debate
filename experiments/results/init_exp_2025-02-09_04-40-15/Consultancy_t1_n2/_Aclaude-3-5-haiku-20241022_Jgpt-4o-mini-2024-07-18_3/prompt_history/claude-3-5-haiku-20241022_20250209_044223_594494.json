I'll prepare my argument focusing on the mathematical reasoning.\n\nIf the judge asks me to explain my reasoning, I would respond:\n\nThe key calculation is straightforward: Mr. Curtis has 325 total chickens, with 28 roosters. This means he has 297 hens. Of these 297 hens, 20 do not lay eggs. By simple subtraction, 297 - 20 = 277 hens are actively laying eggs. This precise calculation shows that 277 represents the number of egg-laying hens on Mr. Curtis's farm. The step-by-step logic eliminates any ambiguity and provides a clear, mathematically sound answer.",
