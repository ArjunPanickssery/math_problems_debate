How many tickets on average did she sell during one of these three days?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 80.0\nCarol sold 960 / 4 = 240 tickets during three days.\nSo in one day, she sold on average 240 / 3 = 80 tickets.\n#### 80\n(A): 1280\nFirst divide the total money by days to get daily revenue\n$960 / 3 = $320 per day\nThen since each ticket is $4, that means she sold 320 \u00d7 4 = 1280 tickets per day\n#### 1280\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 80.0\nCarol sold 960 / 4 = 240 tickets during three days.\nSo in one day, she sold on average 240 / 3 = 80 tickets.\n#### 80"

Simple arithmetic calculation\n2. Straightforward division process\n3. Consistent mathematical logic\n\nI'm prepared to defend this solution by breaking down the steps:\n- Total ticket revenue is $960\n- Each ticket costs $4\n- Total tickets sold: $960 \u00f7 $4 = 240 tickets\n- Average daily tickets: 240 \u00f7 3 = 80 tickets per day\n\nThis approach shows a clear, step-by-step reasoning that directly answers the question about average daily ticket sales.",
