If the judge asks me questions, I will respond strategically to convince them of this answer.\n\nMy key argument is straightforward mathematical calculation:\n- Total credits needed: 120\n- Credits per class: 3\n- Total classes needed: 120 \u00f7 3 = 40 classes\n- Total semesters: 8\n- Classes per semester: 40 \u00f7 8 = 5 classes\n\nThis means Maddy must take exactly 5 classes each semester to graduate on time. The math is clean, precise, and evenly distributed across her college career.\n\nThe calculation shows a perfect, balanced academic load of 5 classes per semester, which is a typical and manageable course schedule for a college student.",
