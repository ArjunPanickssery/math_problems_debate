Let me break down the calculation step by step:\n\nFirst, we calculate the total watch time by multiplying episodes by minutes per episode: 20 episodes * 30 minutes = 600 total minutes. This shows the comprehensive time commitment.\n\nNext, we convert minutes to hours: 600 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes per hour = 10 total hours of content. This demonstrates the full series length.\n\nFinally, we distribute those hours across John's desired 5-day timeline: 10 hours \u00f7 5 days = 2 hours per day. This precisely meets John's goal of finishing the show efficiently.",
