Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How long would it take Moe to eat 800 pieces?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 200.0\nIf it takes Moe 10 seconds to eat 40 cuttlebones, then in one second she eats 40 cuttlebones / 10 seconds = 4 cuttlebones/second\nSince the cat eats 4 pieces of cuttlebone in 1 second, 800 pieces will be 800 cuttlebones / 4 cuttlebones/second = 200 seconds.\n#### 200\n(A): 320.0\nFirst, we need to find how many seconds it takes per piece of cuttlebone:\n10 seconds / 40 pieces = 0.25 seconds per piece\nThen we multiply this rate by the total number of pieces:\n800 pieces * 0.25 seconds/piece = 320 seconds\n#### 320</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"

          "content": "The math clearly shows that 200 seconds is the right answer. The key is realizing that if Moe eats 40 cuttlebones in 10 seconds, that means she eats at a rate of 4 cuttlebones per second (40 cuttlebones / 10 seconds = 4 cuttlebones/second). \n\nThen, to find the total time to eat 800 cuttlebones at that rate, we simply divide 800 by the rate of 4 per second:\n\n800 cuttlebones / (4 cuttlebones/second) = 200 seconds\n\nSo 200 seconds is definitively the correct answer, as proven by the math. The other answer incorrectly calculates the seconds per cuttlebone first, which is the reciprocal of the actual rate needed.",
