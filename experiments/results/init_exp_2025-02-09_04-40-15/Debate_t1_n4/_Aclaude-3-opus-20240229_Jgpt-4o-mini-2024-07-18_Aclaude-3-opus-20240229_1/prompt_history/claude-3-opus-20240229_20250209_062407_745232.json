Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Therefore, the correct calculation is:\n- Find the difference between original and sale price: $350 - $140 = $210 \n- Divide the difference by the original price: $210 / $350 = 0.6\n- Convert 0.6 to a percentage by multiplying by 100: 0.6 * 100 = 60%\n</thinking>\n\nThe math clearly shows that Asia got 60% off the original price of the dress. My opponent's calculation of 150% off does not make sense, as you cannot get more than a 100% discount. They incorrectly divided the $210 savings by the sale price of $140 rather than the original price of $350.\n\nTo get a percentage discount, you always divide the savings amount by the original price, not the sale price. $210 divided by $350 equals 0.6, or 60%. This is the only logical way to calculate the percentage Asia saved on her dress purchase.",
