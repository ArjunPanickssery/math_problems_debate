Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The math clearly shows that Sara ate 16 apples, not 64. The key is recognizing that the question states Ali ate 4 times more than Sara, which translates to the equation A = 4S. Plugging this into the total equation A + S = 80 yields 4S + S = 80, or 5S = 80. Solving this gives S = 16, the number of apples Sara ate. \n\nThe opposing argument incorrectly assumes S = 4A, which is the opposite of what the question states. This leads to the wrong conclusion that Sara ate 64 apples. But 64 + 16 does not equal the total of 80 apples given in the question.\n\nTo verify, we can check that if Sara ate 16 apples and Ali ate 4 times that amount (4 * 16 = 64), then the total would indeed be 16 + 64 = 80 apples, matching the question. Therefore, the evidence clearly supports that Sara ate 16 apples, not 64.",
