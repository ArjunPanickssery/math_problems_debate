Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Calculate 1/4 of the red jelly beans to get the number of coconut flavored ones\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The total number of jelly beans (4000) is given. To calculate 3/4 of that, the expression would be 4000 * 3/4. Then to get 1/4 of that result, the output could be multiplied by 1/4.\n\nSo the tool calls needed are:\n1. math_eval with expr=4000 * 3/4 to get number of red jelly beans \n2. math_eval with expr=<previous result> * 1/4 to get number of coconut flavored jelly beans\n\nAll the required information is available, so no need to ask the user for more details.
