Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu, not 4 more books than Stu. The question states that if Stu has 9 books, then Albert has 4 times that amount. To calculate 4 times 9, we multiply: 4 * 9 = 36. So Albert has 36 books. \n\nTo find the total number of books Stu and Albert have together, we add Stu's 9 books to Albert's 36 books:\n9 + 36 = 45\n\nTherefore, the correct total is 45 books, not 22. Answer choice (B) incorrectly interprets \"4 times\" to mean \"4 more than\".",
