Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

She planted the tree when she was 4 years old and is now 9, so the tree has been growing for 5 years already. Since it takes a total of 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit, there are only 2 more years left until Lydia's tree will produce apples. Therefore, Lydia will be 9 + 2 = 11 years old when she finally gets to enjoy the fruits of her labor.",
