Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

So before buying the book, she must have had $51 * 2 = $102. \n- Before that, Isabel spent half the previous amount on a toy. So before buying the toy, she must have had $102 * 2 = $204.\n- And before buying the toy, Isabel had the initial full amount in her piggy bank. So the initial amount must have been $204 * 2 = $408.\n\nTo present this clearly, I can use the math_eval tool to show the calculations at each step.
