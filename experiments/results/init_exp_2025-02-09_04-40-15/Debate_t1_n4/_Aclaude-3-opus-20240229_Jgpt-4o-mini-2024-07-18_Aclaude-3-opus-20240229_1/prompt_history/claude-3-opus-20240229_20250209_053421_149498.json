Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

      "content": "<thinking>\nThe key to this problem is calculating how many shirts Mary gives away of each color, and then subtracting those amounts from her original numbers to determine how many she has left.\n\nMy assigned answer (B) uses the correct approach:\n- Mary originally has 26 blue shirts. She gives away half, which is 26/2 = 13. So she has 26 - 13 = 13 blue shirts left. \n- Mary originally has 36 brown shirts. She gives away a third, which is 36/3 = 12. So she has 36 - 12 = 24 brown shirts left.\n- In total, Mary has the 13 remaining blue shirts plus the 24 remaining brown shirts, which is 13 + 24 = 37 shirts left.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to verify each of these calculations if needed. But the reasoning and math is straightforward.\n\nIn contrast, answer (A) makes two key mistakes:\n1) It says Mary gives away half her brown shirts, but the question states she gives away a third of the brown shirts. \n2) It says Mary gives away a third of her blue shirts, but the question states she gives away half the blue shirts.\n\nSo answer (A) is using the wrong fractions for each color, swapping the \"half\" and \"third\" values between the blue and brown shirts compared to what the question specifies. This leads to an incorrect final answer.\n</thinking>",
