Dividing $210 by the sale price of $140 gives 150%, which doesn't make sense as a discount percentage. You can't get more than 100% off. \n\n60% is the correct answer, as calculated by dividing the $210 savings by the $350 original price. This properly represents the percentage of the original price that was discounted.\n</thinking>\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is 60%, not 150%. To calculate the percentage off, you need to divide the amount saved by the original price, not the sale price. \n\nAsia saved $210 on the dress, since it was originally priced at $350 and she bought it on sale for $140. To get the percentage off, we calculate:\n\nAmount saved / Original price = $210 / $350 = 0.60 = 60%\n\nSo Asia got the dress for 60% off the original price. 150% would mean the dress was more expensive on sale than the original price, which doesn't make sense.\n\n</transcript>"

          "content": "Here is my argument in favor of answer B (60%):\n\nThe previous argument for 150% is incorrect. You calculate a percentage discount by dividing the amount saved by the original price, not the sale price.\n\nConsider an example: If something originally costs $100 and is on sale for $75, you saved $25. To calculate the percentage discount, it's $25 saved / $100 original price = 0.25 = 25% off. \n\nIf you instead did $25 / $75 sale price, you'd get 0.33 or 33%. But that's not the percentage discount, it's the sale price divided by the percentage of the original price you paid (you paid 75% of the original).\n\nIn this question, the dress was originally $350 and on sale for $140. So $350 - $140 = $210 saved. $210 / $350 = 0.60 = 60% off is correct.",
