          "content": "So the original price of the shoes before the 20% discount was $600. This matches answer choice (B).\n</thinking>\n\nThe original price of the shoes was $600, as shown by the calculation. If Lyra paid $480 after a 20% discount, that means she paid 80% of the original price. Letting x be the original price, we set up the equation 0.8x = 480. Solving for x by dividing both sides by 0.8 gives x = 480 / 0.8 = 600. \n\nSo answer choice (B) of $600 is correct. The opposing argument that you add the 20% discount amount of $96 to the $480 paid to get $576 is incorrect. You need to work backwards from the discounted amount paid to determine the original 100% price, not add the discount to the amount paid. $480 represents 80% of the original price, so the original 100% price must be more than $480.",
