Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

So to get Emily's hair length, we should add 6 inches to Logan's 20 inches.\n\n20 + 6 = 26 \n\nSo Emily's hair is 26 inches long.\n\nNow that we know Emily's hair length, we can calculate Kate's hair length, since it's stated to be half as long as Emily's.\n\nTo get half of Emily's 26 inch hair length, we divide by 2:\n\n26 / 2 = 13\n\nTherefore, Kate's hair is 13 inches long, which matches answer choice (A).\n</thinking>\n\nThe correct answer is (A) 13 inches. Here's why:\n\nThe question tells us that Logan's hair is 20 inches long, and that Emily's hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's. Using this information, we can calculate that Emily's hair is 20 + 6 = 26 inches long.\n\nWe are also told that Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's hair.
