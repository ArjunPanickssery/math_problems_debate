Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Here's why:\n\nWe know Lydia planted the apple tree when she was 4 years old, and she is currently 9. So the tree has already been growing for 9 - 4 = 5 years.\n\nHowever, the key fact is that it takes a total of 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit from when it was first planted. \n\nSince the tree has been growing for 5 years so far, that means it still needs another 7 - 5 = 2 more years before it will start producing apples.\n\nLydia is currently 9 years old. In 2 years when her tree finally bears fruit, she will be 9 + 2 = 11 years old.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Lydia will be 11 years old when she gets to eat an apple from her tree for the first time.",
