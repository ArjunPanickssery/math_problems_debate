Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe relevant information for calculating the uncovered area is:\n- Shoebox dimensions: 4 inches tall, 6 inches wide\n- Block dimensions: 4 inches per side (square)\n\nTo calculate the uncovered area, I need to:\n1. Calculate the area of the shoebox base\n2. Calculate the area of the block\n3. Subtract the block area from the shoebox base area\n\nI have all the necessary information to perform these calculations, so no additional tools are needed.\n</thinking>\n\nThe correct answer is (A) 8 square inches. Here's why:\n\nThe shoebox has a base area of 24 square inches, since it is 6 inches wide and 4 inches tall. We calculate this by multiplying the width and height: 6 inches * 4 inches = 24 square inches.\n\nThe square block placed inside has an area of 16 square inches. Since each side is 4 inches, the area is calculated by squaring the side length: 4 inches * 4 inches = 16 square inches. \n\nTo determine the uncovered area, we subtract the block's area from the shoebox's base area:\n24 square inches - 16 square inches = 8 square inches\n\nTherefore, 8 square inches of the shoebox base are left uncovered by the block.",
