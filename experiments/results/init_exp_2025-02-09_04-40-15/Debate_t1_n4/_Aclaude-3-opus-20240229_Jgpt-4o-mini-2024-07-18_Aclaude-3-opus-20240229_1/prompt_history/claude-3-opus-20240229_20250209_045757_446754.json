Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Calculate the length of the 2 shorter CDs by multiplying 1.5 hours by 2\n2. Calculate the length of the longer CD by doubling 1.5 hours \n3. Add the length of the 2 shorter CDs to the length of the longer CD\n\nI have all the necessary information to perform these calculations, so I can proceed with my argument for why answer A is correct without needing any additional tools.\n</thinking>\n\nThe correct answer is A, that the combined length of James' 3 CDs is 6.0 hours total. Here's why:\n\nTwo of the CDs are each 1.5 hours long. Since there are two CDs of this length, their combined duration is:",
