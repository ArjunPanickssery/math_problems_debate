Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key to solving this problem is to calculate how much Brianne saves each month, starting with the $10 she saves in January. The question states that each month she saves twice as much as the previous month.\n\nTo calculate the savings for each month:\nFebruary savings = January savings * 2\nMarch savings = February savings * 2 \nApril savings = March savings * 2\nMay savings = April savings * 2\n\nNo additional tools are needed, as the problem can be solved by multiplying the previous month's savings by 2 for each subsequent month until we get to May.\n</thinking>\n\nBrianne saves $10 in January. \nIn February, she will save $10 * 2 = $20\nIn March, she will save $20 * 2 = $40\nIn April, she will save $40 * 2 = $80\nFinally in May, Brianne will save $80 * 2 = $160\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) $160. The calculation in answer (A) is incorrect - it triples the amount each month instead of doubling it like the question states.",
