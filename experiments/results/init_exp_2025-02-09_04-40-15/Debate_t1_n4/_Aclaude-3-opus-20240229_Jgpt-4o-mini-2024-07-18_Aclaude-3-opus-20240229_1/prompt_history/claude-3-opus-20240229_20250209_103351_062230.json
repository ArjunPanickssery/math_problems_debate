How many tickets on average did she sell during one of these three days?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 80.0\nCarol sold 960 / 4 = 240 tickets during three days.\nSo in one day, she sold on average 240 / 3 = 80 tickets.\n#### 80\n(A): 1280\nFirst divide the total money by days to get daily revenue\n$960 / 3 = $320 per day\nThen since each ticket is $4, that means she sold 320 \u00d7 4 = 1280 tickets per day\n#### 1280</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe question asks how many tickets on average Carol sold per day over the 3 days. It provides the total revenue of $960 and the price per ticket of $4.\n\nTo calculate the average number of tickets sold per day, we first need to determine the total number of tickets sold. This can be done by dividing the total revenue by the price per ticket:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"960 / 4\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"960 / 4\"},\n    \"result\": 240.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe question asks how many tickets on average Carol sold per day over the 3 days.

This matches answer choice (B).\n</thinking>\n\nThe question clearly states that Carol sold tickets worth a total of $960 over the 3 day period. To determine the average number of tickets sold per day, the first step is to calculate the total number of tickets sold by dividing the total revenue by the price per ticket:\n\n$960 total revenue / $4 per ticket = 240 total tickets \n\nThen, to get the average per day, you simply divide the total tickets by the number of days:\n\n240 total tickets / 3 days = 80 tickets per day on average\n\nThis is basic arithmetic. Nowhere does the question mention anything about multiplying the daily revenue by the ticket price as answer choice (A) incorrectly does. \n\nTherefore, the only logical conclusion is that answer choice (B), 80 tickets per day on average, is correct. The math clearly shows this when you follow the proper steps.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nCarol sold a total of $960 worth of tickets over the three days. Since each ticket costs $4, we can calculate the total number of tickets sold by dividing the total revenue by the price per ticket:\n\n$960 / $4 per ticket = 240 total tickets sold\n\nTo find the average number of tickets sold per day, we then divide the total tickets sold by the number of days:\n\n240 tickets / 3 days = 80 tickets per day on average\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Carol sold an average of 80 tickets per day over the three day period.\n\n</transcript>"

It provides the total revenue of $960 and the price per ticket of $4.\n\nAnswer choice (A) claims that Carol sold 1280 tickets per day on average. It arrives at this by first calculating the daily revenue of $960 / 3 days = $320 per day. It then multiplies this daily revenue by the $4 ticket price to get 320 * 4 = 1280 tickets per day. \n\nHowever, this is an incorrect approach. Multiplying the daily revenue by the ticket price does not give the number of tickets sold. Instead, it gives the revenue that would be generated if each $1 of the daily revenue corresponded to a ticket sold, which is not the case since tickets cost $4 each.\n\nTo properly calculate the average tickets sold per day, we first need to determine the total tickets sold over the 3 days by dividing the total revenue by the ticket price:",
