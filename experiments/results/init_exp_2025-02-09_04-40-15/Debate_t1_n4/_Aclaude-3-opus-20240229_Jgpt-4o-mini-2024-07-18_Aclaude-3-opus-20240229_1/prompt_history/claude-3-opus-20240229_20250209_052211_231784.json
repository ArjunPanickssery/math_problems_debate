Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key difference between the two approaches is how they interpret the phrase \"10 more than 4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked\". \nAnswer A interprets this as Kayla picking 4x + 10 apples, where x is the number Kylie picked. This is the correct interpretation.\nAnswer B incorrectly interprets it as Kayla picking 4(x+10) apples. But the problem states Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times Kylie's amount, not 4 times Kylie's amount plus 10.\nTo definitively show A is correct, I can set up the equation with x as the number of apples Kylie picked, and solve for x. Then I can calculate how many Kayla picked based on that.\n</thinking>",
