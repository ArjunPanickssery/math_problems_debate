Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The math clearly shows that the correct answer is 16 inches per part:\n- There are 5 feet, which is 5 * 12 = 60 inches \n- Plus an additional 4 inches\n- So the total length is 60 + 4 = 64 inches\n- Divided into 4 equal parts is 64 / 4 = 16 inches per part\n\nThe proposed answer of 16.2 inches is incorrect. It makes the mistake of first converting 5 feet 4 inches to 5.4 decimal feet before multiplying by 12 inches/foot. But 4 inches is not equal to 0.4 feet. \n\n4 inches is equal to 4/12 = 0.333 feet. So the proper conversion keeping everything in feet would be:\n5 + 4/12 = 5.333 feet\n5.333 feet * 12 inches/foot = 64 inches\n64 inches / 4 parts = 16 inches/part\n\nIn both cases, whether correctly converting the mixed units of feet and inches to inches first, or expressing everything in decimal feet first, the final answer comes out to exactly 16 inches per part, not 16.2 inches. The 16.2 inch answer is mathematically incorrect.",
