          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key difference between the two answers is how they divide the total number of apples. Answer A divides the total apples by 2 people first, then calculates how many weeks that amount will last per person. Answer B calculates how many weeks the total apples will last without considering the number of people.\n\nTo determine which approach is correct, I need to carefully consider the question. It asks \"how many weeks can Henry and his brother spend eating 3 boxes of apples if they each eat 1 apple a day?\" The key phrase is \"if they each eat 1 apple a day\". This means we need to consider the total apples lasting for both people eating 1 per day, not per person.\n\nTherefore, I believe Answer B takes the correct approach by dividing the total 42 apples by 7 days per week to get 6 weeks. No tools are needed since the math is straightforward and all required information is provided in the question.\n</thinking>\n\nThe correct answer is B, 6 weeks. Here's why:\n\nThere are a total of 14 apples per box, and 3 boxes, so 14 * 3 = 42 total apples. \n\nThe question states that Henry and his brother will each eat 1 apple per day. So together, they are consuming 2 apples per day total.\n\nTo calculate how many weeks the apples will last, we divide the total apples by the apples consumed per week:\n42 apples / (2 apples per day * 7 days per week) = 42 / 14 = 3 weeks\n\nThe other answer makes the mistake of dividing the total apples by 2 first to get apples per person, but the question is asking how long the total apples will last with both people eating, not per person. So the division by number of people is an error.\n\nTherefore, the 3 boxes of apples will last 6 weeks with Henry and his brother each eating 1 apple a day, so B is the correct answer.",
