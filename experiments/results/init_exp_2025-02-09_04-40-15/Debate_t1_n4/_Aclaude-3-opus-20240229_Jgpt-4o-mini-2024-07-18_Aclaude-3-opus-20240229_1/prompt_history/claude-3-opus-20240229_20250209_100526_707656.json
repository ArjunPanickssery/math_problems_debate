Taking the difference, 22.5 cm - 10.5 cm = 12 cm. Therefore, it rained exactly 12 cm more in total on the Tuesdays compared to the Mondays. The math definitively proves that answer choice (A) 12.0 is correct.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe question asks for the difference in total rainfall between Tuesdays and Mondays. While the difference in rainfall per day is indeed 1 cm as my opponent calculated, we cannot simply multiply this by the number of Tuesdays. That would only be valid if there were an equal number of Mondays and Tuesdays. Since there were 9 Tuesdays but only 7 Mondays, we need to calculate the total rainfall for each day of the week separately and then find the difference between those totals. Multiplying the 1 cm difference by 9 ignores the fact that there were 2 extra Tuesdays compared to Mondays.\n\n</transcript>"
