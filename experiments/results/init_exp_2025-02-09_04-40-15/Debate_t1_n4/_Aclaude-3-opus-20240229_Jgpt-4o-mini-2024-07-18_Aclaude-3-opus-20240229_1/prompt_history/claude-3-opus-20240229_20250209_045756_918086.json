Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The question clearly states that 9 fewer students played kickball on Thursday compared to Wednesday. Since 37 students played on Wednesday, we can determine the number of students who played on Thursday by subtracting 9 from 37. This gives us 37 - 9 = 28 students playing kickball on Thursday. To find the total number of students who played on both days, we simply add the number of players from each day: 37 (Wednesday) + 28 (Thursday) = 65 students in total. Therefore, answer choice B, 65 students, is the correct answer.",
