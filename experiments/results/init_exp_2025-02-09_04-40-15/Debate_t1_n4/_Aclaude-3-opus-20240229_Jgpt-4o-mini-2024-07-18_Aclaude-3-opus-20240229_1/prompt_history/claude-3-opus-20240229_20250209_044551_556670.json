          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key pieces of information needed to determine the correct answer are:\n- The total length of rope needed (60 feet, given 6 stories at 10 feet each)\n- The length of each piece of rope being sold (20 feet) \n- The percentage of length lost when lashing pieces together (25%)\n\nWith those inputs, we can calculate:\n- Effective length of each piece after lashing = 20 feet * (1 - 0.25) = 15 feet\n- Number of pieces needed = 60 feet total / 15 feet per piece\n\nThis matches the reasoning given for answer choice B of 4 pieces. The reasoning for answer A ignores the 25% loss when lashing pieces together.\n\nNo additional tools are needed, as the question provides all necessary information and only requires basic arithmetic that can be done mentally.\n</thinking>\n\nThe correct answer is B, that Tom will need to buy 4 pieces of rope. Here's why:\n\nTom needs to lower the rope down 6 stories, and we're told each story is 10 feet. So the total length of rope he needs is 6 * 10 = 60 feet.\n\nHowever, the rope is only sold in 20 foot pieces. If Tom could just connect the pieces end-to-end with no overlap, then 3 pieces would indeed be sufficient since 3 * 20 = 60 feet. \n\nBut the key piece of information is that you lose 25% of the length of each piece when lashing them together. So for each 20 foot piece, the effective usable length is only 20 * (1 - 0.25) = 15 feet.\n\nWith 15 usable feet per piece, to get the required 60 feet total, the calculation is 60 feet needed / 15 feet per piece = 4 pieces required.\n\nTherefore, because of the 25% loss when connecting the pieces, Tom will need to buy 4 pieces of 20-foot rope, not just 3, in order to have a long enough rope to lower down 6 stories. The answer is 4 pieces.",
