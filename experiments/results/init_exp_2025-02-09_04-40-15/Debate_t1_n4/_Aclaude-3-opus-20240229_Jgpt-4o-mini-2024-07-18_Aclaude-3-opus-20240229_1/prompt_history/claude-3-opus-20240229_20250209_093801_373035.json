If she paid $480, how much was the original price of the pair of shoes?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 600.0\nLyra only paid $480 for the pair of shoes which is only 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.\nSo let x be the original price.\nThen 0.8x = $480\nThus x = $480 / 0.8 = $600\n#### 600\n(A): 576\nThe discount amount is 20% of $480 = $96\nThe original price is $480 + $96 = $576\n#### 576</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe relevant information to determine the original price of the shoes is:\n- Lyra paid $480 for the shoes\n- She got a 20% discount\nTo calculate the original price before the discount, we need to determine what amount the $480 discounted price represents in terms of the original price. \nSince the discount was 20%, Lyra paid 80% of the original price (100% - 20% discount = 80% of original price paid).\nIf we let x represent the original price:\n0.8x = 480 (since the $480 Lyra paid is 80% of the original price x)\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.8:\nx = 480 / 0.8<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"480 / 0.8\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"480 / 0.8\"},\n    \"result\": 600.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe relevant information to determine the original price of the shoes is:\n- Lyra paid $480 for the shoes\n- She got a 20% discount\nTo calculate the original price before the discount, we need to determine what amount the $480 discounted price represents in terms of the original price. \nSince the discount was 20%, Lyra paid 80% of the original price (100% - 20% discount = 80% of original price paid).\nIf we let x represent the original price:\n0.8x = 480 (since the $480 Lyra paid is 80% of the original price x)\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.8:\nx = 480 / 0.8<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"480 / 0.8\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"480 / 0.8\"},\n    \"result\": 600.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nSo the original price of the shoes before the 20% discount was $600. This matches answer choice (B).\n</thinking>\n\nThe original price of the shoes was $600, as shown by the calculation. If Lyra paid $480 after a 20% discount, that means she paid 80% of the original price. Letting x be the original price, we set up the equation 0.8x = 480. Solving for x by dividing both sides by 0.8 gives x = 480 / 0.8 = 600. \n\nSo answer choice (B) of $600 is correct. The opposing argument that you add the 20% discount amount of $96 to the $480 paid to get $576 is incorrect. You need to work backwards from the discounted amount paid to determine the original 100% price, not add the discount to the amount paid. $480 represents 80% of the original price, so the original 100% price must be more than $480.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe original price of the shoes must have been $600. If Lyra paid $480 after a 20% discount, that means she paid 80% of the original price. To find the original 100% price, we divide the discounted price of $480 by 0.8, which equals $600. The other answer incorrectly calculates the discount based on the discounted price rather than the original price. A 20% discount on $480 would be $96, but adding that to $480 does not give the correct original price before the discount was applied.\n\n</transcript>"

It then adds that discount amount to the $480 paid to get $576. However, this is not the correct way to find the original price.\n\nInstead, we need to recognize that the $480 Lyra paid represents 80% of the original price, since she got a 20% discount. To find the 100% original price, we need to divide the 80% amount of $480 by 0.8.\n\nUsing the math_eval tool, we can calculate:",
