Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key to this question is carefully reading how many eggs are in each nest, and adding them up correctly. My answer says there are 2 nests with 5 eggs each in the first tree, but the other answer interprets it as 2 eggs in one nest and 5 in another for that tree. I'll need to go back and double check the exact wording of the question to determine which interpretation is correct.\n</thinking>\n\nThe question states \"June found 2 birds nest with 5 eggs each in 1 tree\". This clearly means there are two nests, and each of those two nests contains 5 eggs. So for the first tree, the total number of eggs is 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. \n\nThe question then says \"1 nest with 3 eggs in another tree.\" So the second tree adds 3 more eggs to the total.\n\nFinally, it states \"There was also a nest with 4 eggs in her front yard.\" This adds the final 4 eggs.\n\nTo get the total, we sum the eggs from each location:",
