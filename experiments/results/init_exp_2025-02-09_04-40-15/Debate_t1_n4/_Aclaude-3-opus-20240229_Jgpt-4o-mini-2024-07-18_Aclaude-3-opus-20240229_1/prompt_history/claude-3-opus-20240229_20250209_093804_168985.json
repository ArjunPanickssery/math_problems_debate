So there are 25 boys in the Biology class, which matches answer choice (A).\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct answer is 25 boys in the Biology class. Here's why:\n\nWe know the Physics class has 200 students, and the Biology class has half as many students as the Physics class. So the Biology class has 200/2 = 100 students total.\n\nThe question states there are three times as many girls as boys in the Biology class. Let's represent the number of boys as x. Then the number of girls is 3x. \n\nSince the total number of students is boys plus girls, we can write an equation:\nx + 3x = 100\n\nSimplifying:\n4x = 100\nx = 100/4 = 25\n\nTherefore, there are 25 boys in the Biology class.\n\n</transcript>"

          "content": "While the reasoning in argument B is initially appealing, it makes a critical error. It assumes that since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, you can simply divide the total class size by 3 to get the number of boys. However, this is mathematically incorrect.\n\nLet's look at a simple example to illustrate why. Imagine a class with 3 girls and 1 boy, for a total of 4 students. There are 3 times as many girls as boys. If we followed the logic of argument B and divided the total class size by 3 to get the number of boys, we would calculate 4/3 \u2248 1.33 boys. But of course, you can't have a fractional number of boys - there is exactly 1 boy in this example.\n\nThe correct approach, as shown in argument A, is to let x represent the number of boys, meaning the number of girls is 3x. Then the total class size is x + 3x = 4x. We set this equal to the known total of 100 and solve for x:\n\n4x = 100\nx = 25\n\nTherefore, argument A correctly determines there are 25 boys in the Biology class, not 33.33 as argument B claims. The key is properly setting up the equation based on the given ratio, not just dividing the total by the ratio.",
