Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The key information is:\n- There are 75 total chickens\n- The number of hens is 5 less than 9 times the number of roosters\n\nTo solve this, we need to:\n1. Let a variable represent the number of roosters \n2. Express the number of hens in terms of the number of roosters\n3. Set up an equation for the total number of chickens\n4. Solve the equation for the number of roosters\n5. Plug the number of roosters into the expression for hens to get the final answer\n\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful for steps 4 and 5, to solve the equation and evaluate the expression for the number of hens. All the information needed to set up the equation is provided in the question.\n</thinking>",
