Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key to this problem is understanding what \"5 more than half the cows\" means. The question is asking how many cows are not black, given that 5 more than half the cows are black.\n\nTo calculate this, we need to:\n1. Find half of the total number of cows\n2. Add 5 to that number to get the number of black cows\n3. Subtract the number of black cows from the total cows to get the number of non-black cows\n\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful for steps 1 and 3, but all the necessary information is provided in the question, so no tools are strictly required.\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the question, Sam has 18 cows total. It also states that 5 more than half the cows are black. \n\nTo find half of 18, we can divide 18 by 2:",
