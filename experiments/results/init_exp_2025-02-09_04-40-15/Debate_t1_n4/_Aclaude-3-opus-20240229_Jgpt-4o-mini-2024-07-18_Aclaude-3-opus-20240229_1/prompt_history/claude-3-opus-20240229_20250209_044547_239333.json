Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

No additional tools are needed.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1. Calculate the total number of apples (14 apples/box * 3 boxes = 42 apples)  \n2. Determine how many apples Henry and his brother will eat per week (2 people * 7 apples/person/week = 14 apples/week)\n3. Divide the total apples by the apples eaten per week (42 apples / 14 apples/week = 3 weeks)\n</thinking>\n\nAnswer A is correct that Henry and his brother can spend 3 weeks eating the 3 boxes of apples at a rate of 1 apple per day each. Here's why:\n\nThere are 14 apples in each box, and 3 boxes total. So the total number of apples is:",
