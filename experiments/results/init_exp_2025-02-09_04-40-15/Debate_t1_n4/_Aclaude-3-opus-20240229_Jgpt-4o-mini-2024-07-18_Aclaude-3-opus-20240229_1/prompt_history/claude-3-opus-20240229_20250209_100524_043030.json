Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Then we can calculate half of Emily's hair length to get Kate's hair length.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations, but all the necessary information is already provided in the question.

To calculate half of 26:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"26 / 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"26 / 2\"},\n    \"result\": 13.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nSo Emily's hair is 26 inches long. \n\nThe question also states that Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's hair.

The other answer incorrectly calculated Emily's hair length as 14 inches by subtracting 6 from Logan's 20 inch hair, when it should have added 6 to get 26 inches. Half of 14 is 7, but that is based on the wrong calculation for Emily's hair length.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nLogan's hair is 20 inches long. Emily's hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's, so Emily's hair must be 20 + 6 = 26 inches long. We are told that Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's hair. Since Emily's hair is 26 inches, Kate's hair is 26 / 2 = 13 inches long. Therefore, the correct answer is (A): Kate's hair is 13 inches long.\n\n</transcript>"
