Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many marbles Katrina has (can be inferred from Mabel's total)\n2. How many marbles Amanda has (can be inferred once we know Katrina's amount)\nThen we can subtract Amanda's total from Mabel's 85 to get the difference.\nThe math_eval tool is not needed here as the calculations are straightforward.\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the information given, Mabel has 85 marbles total, and this is 5 times the amount that Katrina has. Therefore, we can determine that Katrina has 85 \u00f7 5 = 17 marbles. \n\nNow, the question states that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many as Katrina. Since Katrina has 17 marbles, twice this amount would be 17 \u00d7 2 = 34 marbles. And if Amanda needs 12 more to reach this doubled amount, that means she currently has 34 - 12 = 22 marbles.\n\nFinally, to calculate how many more marbles Mabel has compared to Amanda, we take Mabel's total of 85 marbles and subtract Amanda's 22 marbles:\n\n85 - 22 = 63\n\nTherefore, Mabel has 63 more marbles than Amanda, so answer choice (A) is correct.",
