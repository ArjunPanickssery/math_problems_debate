Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

To calculate the total number of toys, we need to add the number of toy cars and toy soldiers together. 20 toy cars + 40 toy soldiers = 60 total toys. Therefore, the correct answer is that James buys a total of 60 toys.",
