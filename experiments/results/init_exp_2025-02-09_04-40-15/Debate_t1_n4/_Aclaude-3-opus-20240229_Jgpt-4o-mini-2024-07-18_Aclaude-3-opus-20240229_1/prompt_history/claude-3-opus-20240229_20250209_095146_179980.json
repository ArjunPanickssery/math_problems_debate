Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Answer B is correct.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe question states that Haley has 5 more necklaces than Jason. Since Haley has 25 necklaces, we can determine that Jason has 20 necklaces by subtracting 5 from 25.\n\nIt also says that Josh has half the number of necklaces as Jason. Since Jason has 20 necklaces, Josh must have 10 necklaces, which is half of 20.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the number of necklaces Haley and Josh have is 25 - 10 = 15. \n\nSo the correct answer is that Haley has 15 more necklaces than Josh.\n\n</transcript>"
