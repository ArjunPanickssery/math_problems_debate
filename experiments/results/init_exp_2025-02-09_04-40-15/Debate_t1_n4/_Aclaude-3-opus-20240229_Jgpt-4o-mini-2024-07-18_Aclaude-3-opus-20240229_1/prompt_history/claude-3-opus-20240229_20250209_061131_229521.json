Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

So to calculate Sandra's amount, we multiply Amy's amount of $50 by 2, giving $100 for Sandra.\n\nMy opponent argues that to adjust by Sandra's 2 parts, we should divide Amy's $50 by 2 to get $25 for Sandra. However, this is incorrect. Dividing by the ratio number would only make sense if Sandra's ratio was less than 1. But Sandra's 2 parts in the ratio means she gets double what Amy gets, not half.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) - Sandra got $100, which is 2 times the $50 that Amy received, matching the 2:1 ratio between Sandra and Amy.",
