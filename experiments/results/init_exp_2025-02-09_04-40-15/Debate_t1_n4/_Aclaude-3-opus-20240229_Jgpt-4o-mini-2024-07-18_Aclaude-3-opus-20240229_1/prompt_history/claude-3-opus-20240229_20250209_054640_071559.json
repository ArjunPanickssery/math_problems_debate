Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many total toys does he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nHe buys 2*20=40 toy cars\nSo the total number of toys is 20+40=60\n#### 60\n(A): 40.0\nHe buys twice as many toy soldiers as cars\nThis means he buys 2*20=40 toy soldiers\nThis is the total number of toys\n#### 40</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nTo determine the total number of toys James bought, we need to know:\n1. The number of toy cars he bought\n2. The number of toy soldiers he bought, which is twice the number of toy cars\n\nThe question provides the number of toy cars directly (20), so we can calculate the number of toy soldiers by multiplying the number of toy cars by 2.\n\nTo get the total, we then need to add the number of toy cars and toy soldiers together. The math_eval tool can handle this calculation for us.\n</thinking><tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"20 + 2*20\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"20 + 2*20\"},\n    \"result\": 60,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nTo determine the total number of toys James bought, we need to know:\n1.

James bought 20 toy cars, and twice as many toy soldiers, which is 40 toy soldiers. 20 cars + 40 soldiers = 60 total toys.\n\nMy opponent argues that the total is just the number of toy soldiers (40), but this ignores the original 20 toy cars James also bought. The question asks for the total number of toys, which must include both the cars and the soldiers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 60 total toys.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nJames buys 20 toy cars. He buys twice as many toy soldiers as cars, which means he buys 2*20=40 toy soldiers. Therefore, the total number of toys James buys is the number of toy cars (20) plus the number of toy soldiers (40), which equals 40. The question asks for the total number of toys, not the total of cars and soldiers separately, so 40 is the correct answer.\n\n</transcript>"
