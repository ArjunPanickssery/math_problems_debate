Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key information in the question is:\n- There are 12 chocolate bars total\n- The bars are shared equally between Mike, Rita, and Anita\n- We need to calculate how many bars Mike and Rita got combined\n\nTo calculate the number of bars Mike and Rita got together, we first need to determine how many bars each person got individually when the 12 bars were divided equally among the 3 people. This can be done using the math_eval tool.\n\nOnce we know how many bars each person got, we can add Mike's amount and Rita's amount together to get the total they received as a pair. The math_eval tool can also handle this addition.\n\nSo the key steps are:\n1. Use math_eval to calculate how many bars each person got \n2. Use math_eval again to add Mike's amount and Rita's amount\n</thinking>",
