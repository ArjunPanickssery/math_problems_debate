Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key difference between the two answers is whether the cost of the sodas was $1 each or $1 total. To determine which is correct, I'll evaluate the relevant part of the question:\n\n\"They also got 2 sodas for $1.00 each.\"\n\nThis clearly states the sodas were $1.00 each, not $1.00 total for both. So the total cost of the sodas should be $2.00.\n\nWith this information, I can calculate:\n- Total money pooled: $10 + $8 = $18 \n- Food costs: $6 + $4 + $2 = $12\n- Total with $3 tax: $12 + $3 = $15\n- Change: $18 - $15 = $3\n\nThis matches Answer A. No tools are needed, as the question provides all the necessary information and only requires basic arithmetic, which I can do without tools.\n</thinking>\n\nAnswer A is correct. The question clearly states they got \"2 sodas for $1.00 each\", meaning the total cost of the sodas was $2.00, not $1.00. \n\nThe total bill can be calculated as:\n$6 (chicken wings) + $4 (chicken salad) + $2 (2 sodas at $1 each) + $3 (tax) = $15\n\nSince Lee and his friend had $10 and $8 respectively, their total money was $18.\n\nTherefore, the change they should have received is:\n$18 (total money) - $15 (total bill) = $3\n\nSo Answer A, which states they should have received $3 in change, is the correct answer.",
