Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many more of these books has Peter read than his brother?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 6.0\nPeter has read 8 of these books because 20 x .4 = 8\nHis brother has read 2 of these books because 20 x .1 = 2\nPeter has read 6 more books than his brother because 8 - 2 = 6\n#### 6\n(B): 120\nPeter has read 8 of these books because 20 x .4 = 8\nHis brother has read 2 of these books because 20 x .1 = 2\nThe difference of 6 books needs to be scaled by the total collection size of 20 books to get the final answer: 6 x 20 = 120\n#### 120</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"
