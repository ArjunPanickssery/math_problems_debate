Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Since Jacob's goal was to eat less than 1800 calories per day, we need to subtract his goal from the actual amount eaten to determine how many extra calories he had. 2400 actual calories - 1800 goal calories = 600 extra calories. Therefore, Jacob ate 600 calories more than he planned to.",
