Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

This matches answer choice (B).\n</thinking>\n\nThe question clearly states that Wyatt has 4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue envelopes. Since he has 10 blue envelopes, the number of yellow envelopes must be 10 - 4 = 6. \n\nAdding the 10 blue envelopes and 6 yellow envelopes gives a total of 16 envelopes, which is answer choice (B).\n\nYour calculation that Wyatt has 14 yellow envelopes by adding 4 to the number of blue envelopes is incorrect. The question states he has 4 fewer yellow envelopes, not 4 more. \n\nTherefore, the correct total is 16 envelopes, not 24. Answer (B) is correct based on a straightforward reading of the question.",
