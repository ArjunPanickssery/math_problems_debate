Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How far does he move horizontally, in feet?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2700.0\nHe travels 1450-100=1350 feet vertically\nSo he travels 1350*2=2700 feet horizontally\n#### 2700\n(B): 2900.0\nHe reaches an elevation of 1450 feet\nSince he moves 2 feet horizontally for each vertical foot, he travels 1450*2=2900 feet horizontally\n#### 2900</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe key information provided in the question is:\n- John travels 1 foot vertically for every 2 feet horizontally \n- His elevation increases from 100 feet to 1450 feet\nTo calculate the horizontal distance traveled, we need to:\n1. Find the change in elevation (1450 - 100 = 1350 feet)\n2. Use the ratio of vertical to horizontal travel to calculate the horizontal distance\nSince the question provides all the necessary information, we can directly calculate the horizontal distance without needing any additional tools.\n</thinking>\n\nJohn's elevation increased by 1450 - 100 = 1350 feet. Since he travels 1 foot vertically for every 2 feet horizontally, to gain 1350 feet in elevation, he would have traveled:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"1350 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"1350 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 2700,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe key information provided in the question is:\n- John travels 1 foot vertically for every 2 feet horizontally \n- His elevation increases from 100 feet to 1450 feet\nTo calculate the horizontal distance traveled, we need to:\n1.

Since he moves 2 feet horizontally for every 1 foot vertically, we can directly multiply his final elevation by 2 to determine his total horizontal distance. 1450 feet * 2 = 2900 feet horizontally. The question asks for his total horizontal distance traveled, not the change in horizontal distance. It's important to use his final elevation, not just the change in elevation, to calculate the total horizontal distance covered during his entire climb.\n\n</transcript>"
