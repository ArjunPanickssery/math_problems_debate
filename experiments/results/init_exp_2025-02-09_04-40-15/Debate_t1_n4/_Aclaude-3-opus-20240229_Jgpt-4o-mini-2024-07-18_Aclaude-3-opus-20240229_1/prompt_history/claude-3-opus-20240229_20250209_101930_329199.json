Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Six tiles are purple and the remaining tiles are white.  How many white tiles are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 7.0\nThere are 3 + 1 = 4 blue tiles.\nThere are a total of 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 tiles are yellow, blue, and purple.\nHence, 20 - 13 = 7 tiles are white.\n#### 7\n(B): 10.0\nThe yellow and blue tiles together total 3 + 1 = 4 tiles.\nAdding the purple tiles gives us 4 + 6 = 10 colored tiles.\nTherefore, 20 - 10 = 10 tiles must be white.\n#### 10</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe key information from the question is:\n- There are 20 total tiles\n- 3 tiles are yellow\n- The number of blue tiles is 1 more than yellow, so 3 + 1 = 4 blue tiles\n- 6 tiles are purple\n- The remaining tiles are white\nTo calculate the number of white tiles, I need to:\n1.

The reasoning in (B) is flawed because it fails to account for the yellow tiles in the total colored tile count.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe reasoning in answer A is flawed. It correctly states that there are 3 yellow tiles and 4 blue tiles, for a total of 7 yellow and blue tiles. However, it then claims that the total number of yellow, blue, and purple tiles is 13. This is incorrect. There are 7 yellow and blue tiles, and 6 purple tiles. 7 + 6 = 13, not 3 + 4 + 6 = 13. Therefore, the number of white tiles cannot be 20 - 13 = 7. The correct number of white tiles is 10, as shown in answer B.\n\n</transcript>"
