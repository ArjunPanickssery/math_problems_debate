How many tickets on average did she sell during one of these three days?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 80.0\nCarol sold 960 / 4 = 240 tickets during three days.\nSo in one day, she sold on average 240 / 3 = 80 tickets.\n#### 80\n(A): 1280\nFirst divide the total money by days to get daily revenue\n$960 / 3 = $320 per day\nThen since each ticket is $4, that means she sold 320 \u00d7 4 = 1280 tickets per day\n#### 1280</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nTo determine the average number of tickets Carol sold per day, we need to:\n1.

Here's how we can calculate that:\n\nOver the 3 days, Carol sold tickets worth a total of $960.

The answer of 1280 tickets per day is incorrect, as it mistakenly multiplies the average daily revenue by the ticket price, rather than dividing the total revenue by the ticket price to get the total tickets first.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nCarol sold $960 worth of tickets over three days, and each ticket costs $4. To calculate the average number of tickets sold per day, we first need to find the total revenue per day. $960 divided by 3 days equals $320 per day. Since each ticket costs $4, we can multiply the daily revenue by the ticket price to get the number of tickets sold per day. $320 times $4 equals 1280 tickets sold on average each day.\n\n</transcript>"
