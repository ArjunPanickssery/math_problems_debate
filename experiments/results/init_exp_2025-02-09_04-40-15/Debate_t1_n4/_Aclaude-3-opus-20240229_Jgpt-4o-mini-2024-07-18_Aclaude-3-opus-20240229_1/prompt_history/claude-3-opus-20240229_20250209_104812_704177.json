The 15 classes per semester answer makes the mistake of dividing semester credits by credits per class, rather than total credits.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is 15 classes per semester. Here's why:\n\nMaddy needs a total of 120 credits to graduate. There are 8 semesters in her college career. To determine the number of credits she needs each semester, we divide the total credits (120) by the number of semesters (8):\n\n120 credits \u00f7 8 semesters = 15 credits per semester\n\nNow, each class is worth 3 credits. To find out how many classes she needs to take per semester, we divide the number of credits per semester (15) by the number of credits each class is worth (3):\n\n15 credits per semester \u00f7 3 credits per class = 5 classes per semester\n\nTherefore, Maddy needs to take 5 classes per semester to graduate with 120 credits in 8 semesters.\n\n</transcript>"
