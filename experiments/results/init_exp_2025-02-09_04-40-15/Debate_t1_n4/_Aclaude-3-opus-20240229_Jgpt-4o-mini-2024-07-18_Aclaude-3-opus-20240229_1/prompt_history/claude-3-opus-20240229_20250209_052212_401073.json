Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The math_eval tool confirms that the price Maria paid, after the 40% discount, is $9.00. This matches answer choice (A).\n\nMy opponent argues that a 40% discount means the price is 40% of the original amount. However, this is incorrect. A 40% discount means that 40% is subtracted from the original price, not that the price becomes 40% of what it was originally. \n\nTo illustrate, let's break it down step-by-step:\n- The original price is $15\n- A 40% discount means 0.4 * $15 = $6 is subtracted from the price\n- Therefore, the discounted price is $15 - $6 = $9\n\nSo answer choice (A) of $9 is definitively correct, as confirmed by the math_eval tool. Answer (B) of $6 represents a misunderstanding of how percentage discounts work.",
