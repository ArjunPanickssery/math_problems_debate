Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If Mabel has 85 marbles, how many more marbles does Mabel have than Amanda?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 63.0\nKatrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles.\nTwice as many marbles as Katrina is 17 x 2 = 34\nAmanda has 34 -12 = 22 marbles.\nMabel has 85 - 22 = 63 more marbles than Amanda\n#### 63\n(B): 39.0\nKatrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles\nAmanda will have 17 \u00d7 2 + 12 = 46 marbles\nMabel has 85 - 46 = 39 more marbles than Amanda\n#### 39</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe key information needed to solve this problem is:\n- Mabel has 85 marbles\n- Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina\n- Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina\n\nTo determine how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda, we first need to calculate:\n1. How many marbles Katrina has (can be determined from Mabel's marble count)\n2. How many marbles Amanda currently has (can be determined based on Katrina's marble count and the fact that Amanda needs 12 more to have twice as many as Katrina)\n\nNo additional information or tool calls are needed, as the problem statement provides all the necessary details to perform these calculations and arrive at the final answer.\n</thinking>\n\nMabel has 85 marbles, and we're told she has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. Therefore, Katrina must have 85 \u00f7 5 = 17 marbles.\n\nNow, Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many as Katrina. Twice Katrina's amount is 17 \u00d7 2 = 34 marbles. So if Amanda needs 12 more to reach 34, she must currently have 34 - 12 = 22 marbles.\n\nFinally, to determine how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda, we take Mabel's 85 marbles and subtract Amanda's 22 marbles:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"85 - 22\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"85 - 22\"},\n    \"result\": 63,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe key information needed to solve this problem is:\n- Mabel has 85 marbles\n- Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina\n- Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina\n\nTo determine how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda, we first need to calculate:\n1.

Here's why:\n\nWe know that Mabel has 85 marbles, and that she has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. So we can calculate that Katrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles.\n\nThe question states that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. Since Katrina has 17 marbles, twice that amount is 17 \u00d7 2 = 34. And since Amanda needs 12 more marbles to reach that amount, she currently has 34 - 12 = 22 marbles.\n\nTherefore, Mabel with her 85 marbles has 85 - 22 = 63 more marbles than Amanda. So (B) 39.0 is the correct answer.\n\n</transcript>"
