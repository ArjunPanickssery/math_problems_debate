Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Calculate the number of noodles based on the number of pirates\n2. Add the number of noodles and pirates together\nNo tools are needed, as the question can be answered with simple arithmetic based on the information provided.\n</thinking>\n\nThe question states that there are 7 fewer noodles than pirates in the matrix. We are told there are 45 pirates. \nTo calculate the number of noodles, we take the number of pirates (45) and subtract 7, since there are 7 fewer noodles.\n45 pirates - 7 = 38 noodles\n\nNow that we know there are 38 noodles and 45 pirates, we simply add those together to get the total:\n38 noodles + 45 pirates = 83 total\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that there are 83 noodles and pirates in total in the matrix.",
