No additional tools are needed.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1. Calculate the total number of apples (14 apples/box * 3 boxes = 42 apples)  \n2. Determine how many apples Henry and his brother will eat per week (2 people * 7 apples/person/week = 14 apples/week)\n3. Divide the total apples by the apples eaten per week (42 apples / 14 apples/week = 3 weeks)\n</thinking>\n\nAnswer A is correct that Henry and his brother can spend 3 weeks eating the 3 boxes of apples at a rate of 1 apple per day each. Here's why:\n\nThere are 14 apples in each box, and 3 boxes total.

Henry and his brother each eat 1 apple per day, which is 7 apples per week per person. For the two of them combined, that's:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"7 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"7 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 14,\n}\n</tool_result>\nSo there are 42 apples total.

Answer A is correct.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is (B): 6 weeks. Here's why:\n\nThere are a total of 14 apples per box, and 3 boxes, so 14 \u00d7 3 = 42 apples total. Henry and his brother each eat 1 apple per day, so together they consume 2 apples per day.\n\nTo calculate how many weeks the apples will last, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples consumed per week:\n42 apples \u00f7 (2 apples/day \u00d7 7 days/week) = 42 \u00f7 14 = 3 weeks per person\nSince Henry and his brother each get 3 weeks worth of apples, the total duration is 3 + 3 = 6 weeks.\n\n</transcript>"

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key issue with the argument for answer B is that it incorrectly calculates the total number of weeks by adding Henry's 3 weeks and his brother's 3 weeks. This double counts the apples and weeks.\n\nThe correct approach, as shown in the argument for A, is:\n1. Calculate the total apples (42) \n2. Calculate the apples eaten per week by both Henry and his brother combined (14)\n3. Divide the total apples by the apples per week to get the number of weeks the apples last in total (3)\n\nThere's no need to calculate the weeks per person and then add them together. The apples are shared between Henry and his brother simultaneously over the 3 week period.\n\nTo refute the argument for B, I'll point out the flaw in the reasoning and reaffirm the correct calculation.\n</thinking>\n\nThe argument for answer B is incorrect because it double counts the apples and weeks. It claims Henry will get 3 weeks worth of apples and his brother will also get 3 weeks, for a total of 6 weeks. But this fails to account for the fact that Henry and his brother are eating the apples simultaneously.\n\nThe 42 apples only last for 3 weeks total, not 3 weeks per person. We can confirm this with the following calculation:\n\nTotal apples: ",
