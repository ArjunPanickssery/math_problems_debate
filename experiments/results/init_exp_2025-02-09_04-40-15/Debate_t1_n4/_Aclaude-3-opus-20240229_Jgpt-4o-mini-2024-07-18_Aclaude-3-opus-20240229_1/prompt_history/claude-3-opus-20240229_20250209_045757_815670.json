Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

So the 3 spiders should not be included in the total count of insects.\nThe 12 ants are insects and should be included. \nFor the ladybugs, we start with 8 but then 2 fly away, leaving 6 ladybugs remaining. Ladybugs are insects so the remaining 6 should be included.\nTo calculate the total, I will add the 12 ants and 6 remaining ladybugs. No tools are needed, I can do this simple addition in my head.\n</thinking>\n\nSpiders are arachnids, not insects, so the 3 spiders found by Sami should not be included in the total insect count. The question specifically asks how many insects are remaining. \n\nThe 12 ants seen by Hunter are definitely insects and need to be included. Ming initially found 8 ladybugs, which are also insects, but then saw 2 of them fly away. So of the ladybugs, only the 6 that didn't fly away should be counted.\n\nIn total, there are 12 ants and 6 ladybugs, which sums to 18 insects remaining in the playground. The 3 spiders are irrelevant to the insect total.",
