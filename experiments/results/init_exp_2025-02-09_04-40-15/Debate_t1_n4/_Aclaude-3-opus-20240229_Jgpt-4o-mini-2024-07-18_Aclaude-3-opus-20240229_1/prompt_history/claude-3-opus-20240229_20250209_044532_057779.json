Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

While it's true that they already have 12 robes, the cost of those robes is irrelevant. What matters is the total cost to outfit all 30 singers. At $2 per robe, the school will need to spend 30 x $2 = $60 to ensure every singer has a robe. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) $60.",
