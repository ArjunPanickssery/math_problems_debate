Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The question clearly states that the Bulls won 70 games and the Heat won 5 more games than the Bulls. This means the Heat won 75 games, as 70 + 5 = 75. To find the total games won by both teams together, we simply add the games won by each team: 70 games by the Bulls + 75 games by the Heat = 145 total games. There's no reason to add the extra 5 games a second time as the previous answer did - that would be double counting the extra games won by the Heat. Therefore, 145 games is the correct total.",
