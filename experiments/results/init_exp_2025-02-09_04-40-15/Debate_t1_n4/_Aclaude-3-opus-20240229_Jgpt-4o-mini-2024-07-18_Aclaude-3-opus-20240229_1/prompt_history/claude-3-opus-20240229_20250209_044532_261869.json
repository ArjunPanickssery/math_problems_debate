Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The correct answer is B: 37 shirts. Here's why:\n\nMary starts with 26 blue shirts. She gives away half of them, which is 26/2 = 13 blue shirts. So she has 26 - 13 = 13 blue shirts left.\n\nMary also has 36 brown shirts. She gives away a third of them, which is 36/3 = 12 brown shirts. So she has 36 - 12 = 24 brown shirts left. \n\nIn total, Mary now has 13 blue shirts and 24 brown shirts remaining. 13 + 24 = 37 shirts total.\n\nThe calculation in answer A is incorrect. It mistakenly gives away half the brown shirts and a third of the blue shirts, which is the opposite of what the question states. Following the question properly leads to answer B being correct.",
