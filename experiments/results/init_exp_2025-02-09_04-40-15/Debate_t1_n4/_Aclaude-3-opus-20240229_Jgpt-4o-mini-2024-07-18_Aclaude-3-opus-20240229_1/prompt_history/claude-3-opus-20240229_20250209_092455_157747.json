Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

This is the correct interpretation.\nAnswer B incorrectly interprets it as Kayla picking 4(x+10) apples. But the problem states Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times Kylie's amount, not 4 times Kylie's amount plus 10.\nTo definitively show A is correct, I can set up the equation with x as the number of apples Kylie picked, and solve for x.

The interpretation in B of 4(x+10) is incorrect based on the problem statement. A is the correct answer.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nLet x be the number of apples Kylie picked. Then Kayla picked 4(x+10) apples, which means she picked 4 times the amount Kylie picked plus an additional 40 apples. \nThe total apples picked is 340, so we can set up the equation:\nx + 4(x+10) = 340\nSimplifying:\nx + 4x + 40 = 340\n5x + 40 = 340\n5x = 300\nx = 60\nSo Kylie picked 60 apples. Plugging this back in, Kayla picked 4(60+10) = 4(70) = 280 apples.\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 280 apples.\n\n</transcript>"

Even though their math is correct based on that wrong interpretation, their final answer is still wrong because the interpretation itself is flawed.\nTo further highlight the flaw in B's approach, I can plug in the value of 60 that they calculated for x:\n</thinking>",
