Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Calculate the total number of classes needed by dividing total credits by credits per class\n2. Divide the total number of classes by the number of semesters to get classes per semester\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations.
