Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding how discounts work. When an item is discounted by a certain percentage, the price you pay is the original price minus the discount amount.\n\nIn this case, we know Lyra paid $480 for the shoes after a 20% discount. To find the original price, we need to work backwards from the discounted price.\n\nThe most direct way to calculate the original price from the discounted price and discount percentage is to divide the discounted price by (100% - discount percentage), or 0.8 in this case.\n\n$480 / 0.8 = $600\n\nSo the original price of the shoes before the 20% discount was $600.\n\nThe other approach of adding back the dollar amount of the discount is not the correct way to reverse the discount and will lead to the wrong answer.\n</thinking>\n\nThe original price of the shoes before the 20% discount was $600. Here's why:\n\nWhen an item is discounted by a percentage, the price you pay is (100% - discount percentage) times the original price. In this case, Lyra paid 80% of the original price, since the discount was 20%.\n\nIf we let x be the original price, then 0.8x = $480, since $480 is 80% of the original price x. \n\nSolving this equation:\nx = $480 / 0.8\nx = $600\n\nTherefore, the original price of the shoes before the 20% discount was $600. The approach of adding back $96 as 20% of the discounted price $480 is incorrect, as percentages are based on the original price, not the discounted price.",
