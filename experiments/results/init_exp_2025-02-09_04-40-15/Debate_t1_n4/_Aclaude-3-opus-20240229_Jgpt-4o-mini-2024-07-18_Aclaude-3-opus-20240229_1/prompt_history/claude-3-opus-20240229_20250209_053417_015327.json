Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Multiplying by the spent fraction would give you the amount the housewife spent at the market, not the amount she has remaining. \n\nTo find the remaining amount, you must multiply by the fraction that is left (1/3), not the fraction that was spent (2/3).
