Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

This matches answer choice (A).\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nJohn's elevation increases by 1450 - 100 = 1350 feet. Since he travels 1 foot vertically for every 2 feet horizontally, his horizontal distance is double his vertical distance. Therefore, he travels 1350 * 2 = 2700 feet horizontally. The key point is that we need to consider the change in elevation, not the final elevation, to determine the horizontal distance traveled.\n\n</transcript>"
