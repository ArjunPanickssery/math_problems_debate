Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Stu has 9 books, and Albert has 4 times as many, which is 36 books. 9 + 36 = 45. The question states Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu, not 4 more books than Stu. Multiplying Stu's 9 books by 4 gives us Albert's book count. Adding their books together results in a total of 45 books between them.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nAlbert has 4 times as many books as Stu. This means that if we multiply Stu's book count by 4, we will get Albert's book count. Since Stu has 9 books, Albert must have 9 * 4 = 36 books. To find the total number of books they have together, we simply add Stu's 9 books to Albert's 36 books. 9 + 36 = 45. Therefore, the correct answer is that Stu and Albert have a combined total of 45 books.\n\n</transcript>"
