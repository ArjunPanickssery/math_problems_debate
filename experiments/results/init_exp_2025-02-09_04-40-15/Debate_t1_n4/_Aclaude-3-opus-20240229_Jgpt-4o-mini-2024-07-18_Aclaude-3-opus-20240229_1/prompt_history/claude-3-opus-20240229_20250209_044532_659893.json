Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Therefore, the total number of toys James buys is the number of toy cars (20) plus the number of toy soldiers (40), which equals 40. The question asks for the total number of toys, not the total of cars and soldiers separately, so 40 is the correct answer.",
