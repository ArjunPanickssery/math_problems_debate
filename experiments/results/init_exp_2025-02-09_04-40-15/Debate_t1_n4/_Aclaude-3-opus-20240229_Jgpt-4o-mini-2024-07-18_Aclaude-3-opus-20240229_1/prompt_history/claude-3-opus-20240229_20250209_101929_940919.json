Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100\n(B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe key information given is:\n- The ratio of money shared between Sandra, Amy and Ruth is 2:1:3\n- Amy got $50\nTo determine how much Sandra got, we need to understand how ratios work. The ratio 2:1:3 means that for every 1 part Amy gets, Sandra gets 2 parts and Ruth gets 3 parts.\nSince Amy's amount is known ($50), we can use that as the basis to calculate Sandra's amount. The ratio indicates Sandra gets twice as much as Amy.\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the given ratio of 2:1:3, Sandra gets 2 parts for every 1 part that Amy gets. This means that to calculate Sandra's amount, we need to multiply Amy's amount by 2.\n\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra's amount would be:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"50 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"50 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 100,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe key information given is:\n- The ratio of money shared between Sandra, Amy and Ruth is 2:1:3\n- Amy got $50\nTo determine how much Sandra got, we need to understand how ratios work.

The ratio of money shared between Sandra, Amy and Ruth is 2:1:3 respectively. This means that for every 1 part Amy gets, Sandra gets 2 parts. Since we know Amy got $50, we can determine Sandra's amount by multiplying Amy's $50 by 2, which equals $100. The ratio shows the relative proportions each person receives, so Sandra's 2 parts means she gets double what Amy got.\n\n</transcript>"
