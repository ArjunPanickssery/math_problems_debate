Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The question asks for the combined total of bars that Mike and Rita received. Since the box was shared equally between three people, each person received 4 bars (12 \u00f7 3 = 4). Mike got 4 bars, and Rita got 4 bars. To find their combined total, we must add their individual shares: 4 + 4 = 8 bars. The question specifically asks for Mike and Rita's bars together, not what they shared between themselves. Answer B (8.0) correctly represents the sum of their separate, equal portions.",
