Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The key to this problem lies in correctly interpreting \"9 fewer orange marbles than pink marbles.\" This means we need to ADD 9 to find the difference, not subtract. Katie has 13 pink marbles, so she must have 22 orange marbles (13 + 9 = 22). This makes sense because \"fewer than\" is comparing the pink marbles TO the orange marbles, not describing how to calculate the orange marbles. Then, she has 4 times as many purple marbles as orange marbles, so that's 22 \u00d7 4 = 88 purple marbles. Adding all marbles together (13 + 22 + 88) gives us 123 marbles total.",
