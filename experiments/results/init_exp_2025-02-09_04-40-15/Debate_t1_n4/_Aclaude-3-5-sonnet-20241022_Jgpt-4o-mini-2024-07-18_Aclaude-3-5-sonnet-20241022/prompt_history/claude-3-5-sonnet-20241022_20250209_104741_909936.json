Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

      "content": "<question>QUESTION: Isabel has some money in her piggy bank. She spent half the amount and bought a toy. She then spent half of the remaining money and bought her brother a book. If she has $51 left, how much money, in dollars, did she have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 204.0\nAfter buying the toy, Isabel has 51*2=102 dollars left.\nIsabel had 102*2=204 dollars at first.\n#### 204\n(A): 408.0\nWorking backwards from what's left:\n51 * 2 = 102 is the previous amount\n102 * 2 = 204 is the amount before that\n204 * 2 = 408 was the initial amount\n#### 408</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe key is understanding that \"half the remaining money\" means half of what was left after the first purchase. Let's work backwards: Isabel has $51 now. Before buying the book, she had $102 (since she spent half). Before buying the toy, she had $204 (since she spent half). But this $204 represents what was left after spending half of her initial amount on the toy. Therefore, her initial amount must have been $408. The question asks for the amount \"at first,\" so we must account for both halving operations and work backwards completely to reach the original sum.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe key to solving this problem lies in carefully following Isabel's spending pattern. Let's calculate step by step. After spending half her money on a toy, she spent half of what remained on a book. This means she spent half twice, not three times. If she has $51 left, we can work backwards:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"51 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"51 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 102,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe key to solving this problem lies in carefully following Isabel's spending pattern. Let's calculate step by step. After spending half her money on a toy, she spent half of what remained on a book. This means she spent half twice, not three times. If she has $51 left, we can work backwards:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"51 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"51 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 102,\n}\n</tool_result>\nFirst, $51 doubled gives us $102, which was the amount before buying the book. Then:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"102 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"102 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 204,\n}\n</tool_result>\nFirst, $51 doubled gives us $102, which was the amount before buying the book.

The opposing solution incorrectly doubles one too many times, which doesn't match the problem's conditions. Isabel only spent half her money twice, not three times.\n\n</transcript>"
