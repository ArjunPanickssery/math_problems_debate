Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many games did the Bulls and the Heat win together?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 145.0\nThe Heat won 5 more games than the Bulls so they won 70 + 5 = 75 games.\nThe total games won together is 70+75 = 145 games.\n#### 145\n(B): 150.0\nThe Heat won 5 more games than the Bulls (70).\nSo the Heat won 75 games.\nThe total games between them would be 70 + 75 + 5 = 150 games.\n#### 150</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"
