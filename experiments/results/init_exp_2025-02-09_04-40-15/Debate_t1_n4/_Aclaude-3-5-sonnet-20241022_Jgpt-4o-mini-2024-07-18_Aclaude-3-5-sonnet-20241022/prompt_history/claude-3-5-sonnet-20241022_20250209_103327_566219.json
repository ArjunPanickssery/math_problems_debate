If she has $51 left, how much money, in dollars, did she have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 204.0\nAfter buying the toy, Isabel has 51*2=102 dollars left.\nIsabel had 102*2=204 dollars at first.\n#### 204\n(A): 408.0\nWorking backwards from what's left:\n51 * 2 = 102 is the previous amount\n102 * 2 = 204 is the amount before that\n204 * 2 = 408 was the initial amount\n#### 408</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe solution is clearly 204 dollars. Let's work through this step by step. When Isabel spent \"half the amount\" initially, she went from 204 to 102 dollars. Then, when she spent \"half of the remaining money,\" she went from 102 to 51 dollars. This perfectly matches the information given. The key is understanding that \"half of the remaining money\" refers to half of what was left after the first purchase, not half of the original amount. If we started with 408 dollars, after spending half she would have 204, and then spending half again would leave her with 102, not 51. Therefore, 204 must be the correct initial amount.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe key to understanding this problem lies in carefully tracking the sequence of spending events. Let's solve this step by step. Starting with $51 left, we know Isabel spent half her money twice. When she bought the book, she spent half, leaving $51. This means before buying the book she had $102, which we can verify:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"51 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"51 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 102,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe key to understanding this problem lies in carefully tracking the sequence of spending events.

The opponent's solution only accounts for one halving operation, but Isabel spent half her money twice, requiring us to work backwards through two halvings to find the initial amount.\n\n</transcript>"

When Isabel \"spent half the amount,\" this means she used half of her money to buy something, leaving her with the other half.

Then she spent half of that remaining 102 dollars (51 dollars) on the book, leaving her with 51 dollars. The opponent's solution incorrectly assumes that \"spending half\" means doubling when working backwards, but this is incorrect.
