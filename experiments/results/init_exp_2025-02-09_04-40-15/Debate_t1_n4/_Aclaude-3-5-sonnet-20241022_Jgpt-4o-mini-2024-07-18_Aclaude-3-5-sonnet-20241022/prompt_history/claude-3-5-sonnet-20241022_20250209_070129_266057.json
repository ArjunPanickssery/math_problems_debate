Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The key insight is that Tim buys half the amount of soda cans he had LEFT after Jeff took 6 cans, not half of his original amount. Let's solve this step by step:\n1. Initially: x cans\n2. After Jeff takes 6: (x-6) cans\n3. Tim buys half of remaining: (x-6)/2 cans\n4. Final amount = (x-6) + (x-6)/2 = 24\n\nThe equation (x-6) + (x-6)/2 = 24 correctly represents the situation. When solved:\n2(x-6) + (x-6) = 48\n3x - 18 = 48\n3x = 66\nx = 22\n\nAnswer B (22 cans) is mathematically sound and follows the problem's precise wording.",
