Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The phrase \"twice more\" means multiplying by 2, not adding twice the amount. When we say someone has \"twice more\" of something, we mean they have double the original amount. Therefore, Victoria has 4 \u00d7 2 = 8 scoops of ice cream. To find how many more scoops Victoria has than Oli, we subtract Oli's scoops from Victoria's: 8 - 4 = 4 more scoops. Answer A incorrectly interprets \"twice more\" as adding twice the original amount, which would be an unusual and mathematically imprecise interpretation of the phrase.",
