Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If she gives away half of her blue shirts and a third of her brown shirts, how many shirts does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 37.0\nMary gives away 26/2 = 13 blue shirts.\nMary gives away 36/3 = 12 brown shirts.\nMary has 26-13 = 13 blue shirts left.\nMary has 36-12 = 24 brown shirts left.\nMary has 13+24 = 37 shirts left.\n#### 37\n(A): 35.0\nMary gives away 36/2 = 18 brown shirts.\nMary gives away 26/3 \u2248 9 blue shirts.\nMary has 26-9 = 17 blue shirts left.\nMary has 36-18 = 18 brown shirts left.\nMary has 17+18 = 35 shirts left.\n#### 35</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe question states Mary gives away \"half\" and \"a third\" of her shirts, but it's ambiguous whether these fractions apply to the specific color groups or to the total number of shirts. Since Mary has a total of 62 shirts, it makes more sense to interpret \"half\" as applying to the brown shirts (36 is closer to half of 62) and \"a third\" to the blue shirts (26 is closer to a third of 62). This interpretation yields 18 brown shirts given away (36/2) and approximately 9 blue shirts given away (26/3), leaving her with 35 shirts total. This reading is more natural as it aligns the fractions with the proportions of her total shirt collection.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe answer of 37 shirts is clearly correct based on careful reading of the problem. The question explicitly states that Mary gives away \"half of her blue shirts and a third of her brown shirts.\" Let's verify the calculations:\n\nFor blue shirts: Half of 26 is 13 given away, leaving 13.<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"26/2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"26/2\"},\n    \"result\": 13.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe answer of 37 shirts is clearly correct based on careful reading of the problem. The question explicitly states that Mary gives away \"half of her blue shirts and a third of her brown shirts.\" Let's verify the calculations:\n\nFor blue shirts: Half of 26 is 13 given away, leaving 13.<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"26/2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"26/2\"},\n    \"result\": 13.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nFor brown shirts: One-third of 36 is 12 given away, leaving 24.<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"36/3\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"36/3\"},\n    \"result\": 12.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nFor brown shirts: One-third of 36 is 12 given away, leaving 24.<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"36/3\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"36/3\"},\n    \"result\": 12.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nTotal remaining: 13 + 24 = 37 shirts.<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"13 + 24\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"13 + 24\"},\n    \"result\": 37,\n}\n</tool_result>\nTotal remaining: 13 + 24 = 37 shirts.<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"13 + 24\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"13 + 24\"},\n    \"result\": 37,\n}\n</tool_result>\nAnswer A incorrectly assumes Mary gives away half of her brown shirts and one-third of her blue shirts, which is the opposite of what the question states. This fundamental misreading leads to the wrong answer of 35.\n\n</transcript>"
