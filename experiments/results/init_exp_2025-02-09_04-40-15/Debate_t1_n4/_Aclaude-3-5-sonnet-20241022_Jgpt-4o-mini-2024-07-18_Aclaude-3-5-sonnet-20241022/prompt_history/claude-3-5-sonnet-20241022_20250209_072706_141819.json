Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The conversion rate of 1 gallon to 8 pints is a well-established standard measurement. Therefore, 4.5 gallons must be converted to pints by multiplying by 8, giving us 36 pints total. When this is divided equally among 18 thermoses, each thermos contains 2 pints of coffee. Since Genevieve drank 3 thermoses, she consumed 6 pints of coffee in total (2 pints \u00d7 3 thermoses). The opposing argument incorrectly uses a conversion rate of 4 pints per gallon, which is simply wrong. The standard conversion of 1 gallon = 8 pints has been used for centuries and is the only correct conversion factor.",
