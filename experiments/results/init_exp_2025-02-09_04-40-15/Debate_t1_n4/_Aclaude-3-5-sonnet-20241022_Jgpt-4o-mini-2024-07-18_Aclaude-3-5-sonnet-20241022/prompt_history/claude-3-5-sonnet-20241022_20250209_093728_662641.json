Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

      "content": "<question>QUESTION: Ali and Sara ate 80 small apples combined. Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara. How many apples did Sara eat?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 16.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: A = 4S\nWhich means: 4S + S = 80\nSo: 5S = 80\nSo the number of apples Sara ate is: S = 80 / 5= 16 apples\n#### 16\n(A): 64.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: S = 4A\nWhich means: A + 4A = 80\nSo: 5A = 80\nTherefore: A = 16\nAnd finally: S = 4A = 4 \u00d7 16 = 64 apples\n#### 64</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe statement \"Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara\" means that Ali's portion (A) equals 4 times Sara's portion (S), or A = 4S. This is a standard mathematical interpretation of the phrase \"times more than.\" When we plug this into the total equation A + S = 80, we get 4S + S = 80, which simplifies to 5S = 80. Therefore, Sara ate 16 apples, and Ali ate 64 apples. This maintains the 4:1 ratio between Ali and Sara's portions while satisfying the total of 80 apples. The alternative interpretation would incorrectly reverse the ratio, contradicting the clear statement that Ali ate more than Sara.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe key is understanding what \"4 times more\" means. When we say \"4 times more,\" we mean 4 times the base amount plus the base amount, or 5 times total. This is incorrect - \"4 times more\" literally means 4 multiplied by the base amount. When Ali eats 4 times more apples than Sara, it means Sara's amount multiplied by 4 equals Ali's amount. Therefore, if A = 16 (Ali's apples), then Sara must have eaten S = 4A = 64 apples. Let me verify:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"16 + 64\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"16 + 64\"},\n    \"result\": 80,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe key is understanding what \"4 times more\" means.

The interpretation that Ali ate 4 times Sara's amount would give an incorrect total.\n\n</transcript>"

          "content": "The phrase \"4 times more\" mathematically translates to A = 4S, where A is Ali's portion and S is Sara's portion. This is the standard mathematical interpretation used in textbooks and word problems. If Sara ate 16 apples, then Ali ate 64 apples (4 \u00d7 16), which sums to 80 apples total. The opponent's interpretation reverses the ratio, suggesting Sara ate more than Ali, which directly contradicts the problem statement that Ali ate more than Sara.
