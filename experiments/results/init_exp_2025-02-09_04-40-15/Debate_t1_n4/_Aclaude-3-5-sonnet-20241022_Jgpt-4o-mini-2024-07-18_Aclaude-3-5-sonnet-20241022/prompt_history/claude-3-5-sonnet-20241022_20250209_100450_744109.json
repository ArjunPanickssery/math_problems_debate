Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The key point is that the 7-year growth period for an apple tree must be counted from her current age of 9, not from when she planted it. This is because apple trees need 7 continuous years of proper care and maturity to bear fruit. Even though she planted it at age 4, the early years of improper care or neglect (as she was too young to properly tend to it) means we must restart the 7-year countdown from her current age.
