Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The key is understanding that \"half the remaining money\" means half of what was left after the first purchase. Let's work backwards: Isabel has $51 now. Before buying the book, she had $102 (since she spent half). Before buying the toy, she had $204 (since she spent half). But this $204 represents what was left after spending half of her initial amount on the toy. Therefore, her initial amount must have been $408. The question asks for the amount \"at first,\" so we must account for both halving operations and work backwards completely to reach the original sum.",
