Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Since the box was first divided equally among three people (Mike, Rita, and Anita), each person got 4 bars. Then, Mike and Rita shared their portion equally, meaning they split their 4 bars between them. Let me demonstrate:",
