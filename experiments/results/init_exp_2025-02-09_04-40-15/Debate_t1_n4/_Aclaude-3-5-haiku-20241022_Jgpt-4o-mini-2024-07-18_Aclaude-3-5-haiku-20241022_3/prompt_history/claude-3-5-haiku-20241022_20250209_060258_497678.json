If she has 90 green houses, how many of her houses are not yellow?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 160.0\nIf the number of green houses is three times the number of yellow houses, and there are 90 green houses, then there are 90/3 = 30 yellow houses.\nShe also has 40 fewer yellow houses than blue houses, meaning there are 30+40 = 70 blue houses.\nThe number of houses that are not yellow is 70 blue houses +90 green houses = 160\n#### 160\n(A): 200.0\nIf green houses are three times yellow houses, and there are 90 green houses, then there are 90/3 = 30 yellow houses.\nYellow houses are 40 fewer than red houses, so there are 70 red houses.\nTo find all non-yellow houses, we add green houses (90) and red houses (70).\nThen we need to add the difference of 40 between red and yellow to get all non-yellow houses: 90 + 70 + 40 = 200\n#### 200</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nI'll argue for answer A (200) with a clear and concise argument:\n\nLet's break down the house colors systematically. We know Isabella has 90 green houses, which means she has 30 yellow houses (since green is three times yellow). The problem states she has 40 fewer yellow houses than red houses, which means she has 70 red houses.\n\nTo calculate non-yellow houses, we add green and red houses: 90 green + 70 red = 160. However, the key insight is the 40-house difference between red and yellow. This additional 40 houses must also be counted in non-yellow houses.<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"90 + 70 + 40\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"90 + 70 + 40\"},\n    \"result\": 200,\n}\n</tool_result>\nI'll argue for answer A (200) with a clear and concise argument:\n\nLet's break down the house colors systematically.

We know Isabella has 90 green houses, which is three times her yellow houses. This means she has 30 yellow houses. The problem states she has 40 fewer yellow houses than red houses, so her red houses total 70. The non-yellow houses are green (90) and red (70), which sum to 160. The key is to carefully track the relationships between house colors and not add extra quantities. The step-by-step calculation shows 90 green + 70 red = 160 total non-yellow houses, making 160 the correct answer.\n\n</transcript>"

The problem states she has 40 fewer yellow houses than red houses, so her red houses total 70. \n\nThe non-yellow houses are simply the green and red houses: 90 green + 70 red = 160 total non-yellow houses.
