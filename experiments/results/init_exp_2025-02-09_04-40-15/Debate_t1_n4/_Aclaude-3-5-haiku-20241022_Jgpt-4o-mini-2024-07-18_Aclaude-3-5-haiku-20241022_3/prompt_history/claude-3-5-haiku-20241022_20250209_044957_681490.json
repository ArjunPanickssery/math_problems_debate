Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "I will argue for Answer A (780.0 miles):\n\nThe key point is that during the 30-minute break, Jace is not moving, so no miles are traveled. Therefore, the total driving time is strictly 4 + 9 = 13 hours. Multiplying 60 miles per hour by 13 hours gives exactly 780 miles. The break time should not be included in the distance calculation because no distance is covered during a stationary period. The problem asks about miles traveled, which occurs only when the vehicle is in motion. The 30-minute break is irrelevant to the total distance, and should be subtracted from the total time calculation.",
