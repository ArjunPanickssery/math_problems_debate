The total cost of her purchase is $282, but she only gave $250. This means she is short $32, not that she received change. The negative change of -$32 indicates she needs to pay an additional $32 to complete her purchase.\n\nThis precise calculation supports the answer (A): -32.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nLaura's total purchase cost is $240, calculated by multiplying 2 pants at $54 each ($108) and 4 shirts at $33 each ($132). When she pays with $250, the cashier gives her $10 in change. The calculation is straightforward: \n\n1. Pants cost: 2 * $54 = $108\n2. Shirts cost: 4 * $33 = $132\n3. Total purchase: $108 + $132 = $240\n4. Change: $250 - $240 = $10\n\nThe alternative calculation incorrectly swaps the prices of pants and shirts, leading to an erroneous total of $282 and a negative change of -$32. This doesn't make sense in a real-world transaction where the customer pays less than the total cost. The correct answer is clearly $10 in change.\n\n</transcript>"
