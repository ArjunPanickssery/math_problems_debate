If the shortest piece is 16 cm, how long was the entire wire before it was cut?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 96.0\nSince the shortest part is consists of 2 parts, then each part is equal to 16 cm/2 = 8 cm.\nThe whole wire was cut into 7 + 3 + 2 = 12 parts.\nHence, the wire was 8 cm x 12 = 96 cm long\n#### 96\n(B): 64\nIf we take the middle piece (ratio 3) as 16 cm, then each unit length is 16 \u00f7 3 = 5.33... cm\nFor ratio 7: 7 \u00d7 5.33... = 37.33... cm\nFor ratio 3: 16 cm\nFor ratio 2: 2 \u00d7 5.33... = 10.67... cm\nTotal length = 37.33... + 16 + 10.67... = 64 cm\n#### 64</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nI will argue in favor of answer B (64 cm) using a clear mathematical reasoning approach.\n\nLet's break down the ratio 7:3:2, where the shortest piece (2 parts) is 16 cm.

The method is precise and follows the given ratio and shortest piece length.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nI will argue in favor of Answer A (96 cm) being the correct solution.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding the ratio and how it relates to the wire's total length. The wire is divided into three pieces with a ratio of 7:3:2, and we know the shortest piece is 16 cm. This shortest piece represents 2 parts out of the total 12 parts (7+3+2).\n\nBy calculating that each part is 8 cm (16 cm \u00f7 2), we can determine the total wire length by multiplying the total parts (12) by the length of each part (8 cm). This gives us 96 cm, which matches the calculation in Answer A.\n\nThe method is straightforward, systematic, and follows a clear logical progression from the given information about the wire's ratio and shortest piece length.\n\n</transcript>"
