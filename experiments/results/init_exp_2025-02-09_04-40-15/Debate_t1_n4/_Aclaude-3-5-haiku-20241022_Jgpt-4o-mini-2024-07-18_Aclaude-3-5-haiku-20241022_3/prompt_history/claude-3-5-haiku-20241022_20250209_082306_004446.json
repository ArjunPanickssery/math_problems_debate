How many apples did Sara eat?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 16.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: A = 4S\nWhich means: 4S + S = 80\nSo: 5S = 80\nSo the number of apples Sara ate is: S = 80 / 5= 16 apples\n#### 16\n(A): 64.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: S = 4A\nWhich means: A + 4A = 80\nSo: 5A = 80\nTherefore: A = 16\nAnd finally: S = 4A = 4 \u00d7 16 = 64 apples\n#### 64</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nI'll argue for answer B (16 apples) by demonstrating the algebraic reasoning:\n\nLet's verify the key equations step by step.

This means Sara ate 16 apples, and Ali ate 4 \u00d7 16 = 64 apples, which perfectly satisfies both conditions of the problem.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nI will argue in favor of answer A (64 apples for Sara).\n\nThe key to solving this problem is carefully tracking the relationships between Ali's and Sara's apple consumption. The problem states that Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara, which means Sara's apple count is actually the smaller portion of the total.\n\nLet's break down the algebraic reasoning:\n1. Total apples = 80\n2. Ali's apples = 4 \u00d7 Sara's apples\n3. Ali's apples + Sara's apples = 80\n4. If we substitute 4S for Ali's apples: 4S + S = 80\n5. This means 5S = 80\n6. But this approach incorrectly assumes Sara is the base\n7. Instead, if we set Ali as the base: A + 4A = 80\n8. This yields A = 16\n9. Therefore, Sara's apples = 4A = 4 \u00d7 16 = 64\n\nThe solution of 64 apples for Sara correctly represents the \"4 times more\" relationship between Ali and Sara's apple consumption.\n\n</transcript>"
