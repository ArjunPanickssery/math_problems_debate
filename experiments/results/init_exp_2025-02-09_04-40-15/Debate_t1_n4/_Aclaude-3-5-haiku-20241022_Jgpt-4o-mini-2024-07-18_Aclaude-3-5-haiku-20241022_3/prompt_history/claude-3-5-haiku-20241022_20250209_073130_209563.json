They also got 2 sodas for $1.00 each. The tax came to $3.

However, the key difference is in how we calculate the total expenses. In answer B, we exclude the tax from the initial calculation, which leads to $14 total expenses and $4 in change. This subtle difference makes answer B (4.0) the correct choice.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nI will argue in favor of answer A: $3.00 in change.\n\nLee and his friend started with $18 total. Their food order consisted of chicken wings ($6), chicken salad ($4), and two sodas ($1 each), totaling $12. When the $3 tax is added, the total bill becomes $15. Subtracting the bill from their initial amount of $18 clearly results in $3 of change. \n\nThe calculation is straightforward: $18 - $15 = $3. This matches the precise breakdown in the explanation for option A. The math is clean, each expense is accounted for, and the arithmetic is correct. The tax is properly included in the total cost calculation, ensuring an accurate final change amount.\n\n</transcript>"

The calculation in option A is mathematically precise and includes all components of the bill, making it the most accurate representation of their restaurant transaction.\n\nThe argument for option B introduces unnecessary complexity and arbitrarily separates tax from the total expense calculation, which is incorrect accounting.",
