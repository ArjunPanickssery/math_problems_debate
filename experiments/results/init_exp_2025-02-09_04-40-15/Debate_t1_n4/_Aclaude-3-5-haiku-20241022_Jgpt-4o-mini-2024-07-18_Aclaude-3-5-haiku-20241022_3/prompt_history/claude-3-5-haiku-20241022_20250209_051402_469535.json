Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "I'll argue for Answer A (83) being the correct solution:\n\nThe problem states that on Thursday, 9 fewer students played kickball compared to Wednesday. However, the interpretation matters critically. Answer A correctly calculates this by adding 9 to the Wednesday number, showing 46 students on Thursday, not subtracting 9 as the other answer does.\n\nBy adding 9 to the original 37 students, we get 46 students on Thursday, which makes logical sense. When we then sum Wednesday's 37 and Thursday's 46, we arrive at 83 total students across both days. This approach recognizes that \"9 fewer\" doesn't automatically mean subtraction, but could mean a relative change in the total number of participants.\n\nThe key is understanding the phrase \"9 fewer\" as a comparative statement, not a direct subtraction.",
