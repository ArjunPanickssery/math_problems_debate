The correct approach is to convert 600 minutes to hours by dividing by 60, which gives 10 hours total, then divide by 5 days to get 2 hours per day. Therefore, answer A (2.0 hours) is the correct solution.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nJohn needs to watch 2 hours per day to complete the show in 5 days. Let's break this down systematically:\n\n1. Total show length: 20 episodes * 30 minutes = 600 minutes\n2. Convert minutes to hours: 600 minutes = 10 hours total\n3. Divide total hours by days: 10 hours \u00f7 5 days = 2 hours per day\n\nThe calculation is straightforward and follows logical mathematical steps. Watching 2 hours daily will ensure John completes the entire 20-episode show within his 5-day goal. The math is precise and leaves no room for ambiguity. The answer of 2 hours per day is correct and directly derived from the given information.\n\n</transcript>"
