The calculation in Answer A is precise and accounts for both people sharing the apples equally.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nMy argument for answer B (6 weeks):\n\nThe key calculation is to determine how many apples are consumed per week. Since Henry and his brother each eat 1 apple per day, together they consume 2 apples daily. In one week, they will eat 14 apples (2 apples \u00d7 7 days). \n\nWith 42 total apples from 3 boxes (14 apples/box \u00d7 3 boxes), we divide the total apples by apples consumed per week: 42 \u00f7 7 = 6 weeks. \n\nThe opponent's calculation incorrectly assumes each person gets 21 apples and then divides by weeks, which doesn't account for their combined daily consumption. My method correctly calculates total weekly apple consumption and total available apples.\n\n</transcript>"
