The key difference from Answer A is in how Mr. Ha's silver dollars are calculated.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nI'll argue in favor of answer A (205 silver dollars):\n\nMy calculation follows a clear, step-by-step logical progression. Mr. Chiu starts with 56 silver dollars. Mr. Phung has 16 more than Mr. Chiu, which means he has 72 silver dollars. Mr. Ha owns 5 more silver dollars than Mr. Phung, so he has 77 silver dollars. When we add these together (56 + 72 + 77), we get exactly 205 silver dollars. The problem statement provides precise relationships between the amounts, and my calculation methodically follows those relationships to arrive at the total. Each step is mathematically sound and directly derived from the original information.\n\n</transcript>"
