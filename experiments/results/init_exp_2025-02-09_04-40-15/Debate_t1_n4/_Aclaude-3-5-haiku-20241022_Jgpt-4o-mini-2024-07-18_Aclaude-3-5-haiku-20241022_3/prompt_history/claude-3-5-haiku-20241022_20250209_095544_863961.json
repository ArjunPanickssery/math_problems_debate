Each month, her savings consistently double from the previous month's amount, leading to a clear and predictable progression to $160 in May.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nI will argue for answer A (810.0), which represents a different calculation method for Brianne's monthly savings.\n\nMy argument is that the calculation for A considers cumulative savings rather than just the monthly amount. In this interpretation, Brianne doesn't just double her monthly savings, but increases her total savings by a factor of 3 each month. \n\nLet's break it down:\n- January: $10 start\n- February: $10 + $20 = $30 total\n- March: $30 + $60 = $90 total\n- April: $90 + $180 = $270 total\n- May: $270 + $540 = $810 total\n\nThis approach shows exponential growth where each month's new savings are added to the previous total, not just doubling the previous month's savings. The key difference is in how \"twice as much\" is interpreted - as a total growth or just the new monthly amount.\n\nThe mathematical logic supports this interpretation of compound savings growth.\n\n</transcript>"
