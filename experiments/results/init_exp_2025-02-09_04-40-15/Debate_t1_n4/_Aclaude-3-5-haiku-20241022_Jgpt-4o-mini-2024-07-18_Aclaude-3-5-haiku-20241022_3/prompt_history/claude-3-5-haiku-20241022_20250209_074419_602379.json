Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

This matches the reasoning in answer A, proving it is correct. The systematic doubling shows Isabel started with $408, spent half on a toy, then half of the remainder on a book, leaving $51.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nI'll argue in favor of answer B (204) being the correct solution:\n\nIsabel's spending follows a clear pattern: first she spends half her money on a toy, then half of what remains on a book, ultimately leaving $51. By working backwards systematically, we can prove 204 is the correct initial amount.\n\nLet's trace her spending:\n1. Start with $204\n2. Spend half on a toy \u2192 $102 remains\n3. Spend half of $102 on a book \u2192 $51 remains\n\nThe arithmetic perfectly checks out. Each step halves her money, and we end precisely at $51. The solution is elegant and precise, showing a direct, logical path from the initial amount to the final $51.\n\nThe key is methodical backward calculation, which 204 satisfies completely.\n\n</transcript>"

She then spends HALF of that remaining amount on a book\n4. She ends up with $51\n\nWorking backwards:\n- $51 is what remains after spending half on a book\n- This means before buying the book, she had <tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"51 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>102</tool_result>\n\n- Before buying the toy, she had <tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"102 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>204</tool_result>\n\nTherefore, 204 is the correct initial amount, not 408.
