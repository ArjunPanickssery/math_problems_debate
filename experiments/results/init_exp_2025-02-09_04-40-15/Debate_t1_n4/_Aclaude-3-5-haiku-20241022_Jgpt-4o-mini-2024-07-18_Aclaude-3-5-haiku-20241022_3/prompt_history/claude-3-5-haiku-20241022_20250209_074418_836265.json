Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Since Darla has 6 books, Katie must have 3 books, not 12 as the opposing argument suggests. This is a critical point. When calculating Gary's books, we use the correct combined total of Darla (6) and Katie (3), which is 9 books. Gary has 5 times this amount, which equals 45 books. Adding Darla's 6, Katie's 3, and Gary's 45 gives us exactly 54 books total. The opposing solution incorrectly doubles Katie's book count, leading to an inflated and incorrect total.\n\n</transcript>"
