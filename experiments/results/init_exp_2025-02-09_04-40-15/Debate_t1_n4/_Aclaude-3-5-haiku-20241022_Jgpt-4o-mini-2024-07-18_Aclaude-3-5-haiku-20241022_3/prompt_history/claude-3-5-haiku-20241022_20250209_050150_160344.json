Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The correct answer is 60. James buys 20 toy cars, and since he buys twice as many toy soldiers as toy cars, he purchases 40 toy soldiers. Adding these together gives a total of 60 toys. The problem statement clearly indicates that James buys twice as many toy soldiers as toy cars, which means he has 40 toy soldiers in addition to the 20 toy cars. Simple arithmetic shows that 20 + 40 = 60 total toys. The key is to carefully read the entire problem and account for both types of toys in the calculation.",
