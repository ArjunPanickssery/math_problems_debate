Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

First, the 3 basses require 12 strings (3 * 4 = 12). Then, the normal guitars - which are twice the number of basses - are 6 guitars, consuming 36 strings (6 * 6 = 36). The 8-string guitars are 3 fewer than the normal guitars, which means 3 eight-string guitars, consuming 24 strings (3 * 8 = 24). When we sum these: 12 + 36 + 24 = 72 strings total. The arithmetic is clean, follows the problem's instructions exactly, and results in a coherent total of 72 strings. The step-by-step breakdown shows clear, logical reasoning that matches the problem's specifications precisely.\n\n</transcript>"
