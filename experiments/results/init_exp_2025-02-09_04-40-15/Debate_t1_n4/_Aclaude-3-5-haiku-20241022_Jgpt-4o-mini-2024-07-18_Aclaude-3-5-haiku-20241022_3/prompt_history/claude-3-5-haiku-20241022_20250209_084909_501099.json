The calculation is straightforward: Peter read 8 books, his brother read 2 books, and 8 - 2 = 6. There's no need to multiply by the total number of books. The question asks how many more books Peter has read, which is simply 6.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nMy argument for why the answer is 120:\n\nThe key insight is that the raw difference of 6 books needs to be contextualized by the total book collection size. By multiplying the 6-book difference by the total number of books (20), we scale the relative reading difference to reflect the broader collection context. This scaling reveals the true magnitude of the reading disparity. The calculation 6 x 20 = 120 captures the proportional significance of Peter's additional reading compared to his brother's, transforming a simple arithmetic difference into a more nuanced representation of their reading habits relative to the entire book collection.\n\n</transcript>"
