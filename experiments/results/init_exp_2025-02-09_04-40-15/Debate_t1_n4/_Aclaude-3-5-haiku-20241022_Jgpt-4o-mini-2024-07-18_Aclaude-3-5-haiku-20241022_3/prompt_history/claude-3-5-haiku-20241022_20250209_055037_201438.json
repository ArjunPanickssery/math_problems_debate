Answer B suggests adding an additional 6 to account for the \"6 more\" condition, resulting in 72 total bowling balls. This interpretation means we're not just adding the red and green balls, but also accounting for the comparative difference explicitly.\n\nBy this logic, the total becomes 30 + 36 + 6 = 72, which matches answer B precisely.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct answer is clearly 66. The problem states there are 30 red bowling balls, and 6 more green bowling balls than red. This means there are 36 green bowling balls (30 + 6 = 36). When we add the red and green bowling balls together, we get a total of 66 bowling balls (30 + 36 = 66). The calculation is straightforward and follows the problem's description precisely. Answer B incorrectly adds an extra 6 to the total, which doesn't align with the original problem statement. The key is to recognize that \"6 more than red\" means 36 green balls, not 36 plus an additional 6.\n\n</transcript>"

The opponent's argument of adding an extra 6 is mathematically incorrect and introduces an arbitrary additional number not supported by the problem statement. The phrase \"6 more green bowling balls than red\" is a direct comparison, not an additional count to be added separately.\n\nThe key is to interpret \"6 more\" as creating the total number of green balls, not as an extra addition to the final count.",
