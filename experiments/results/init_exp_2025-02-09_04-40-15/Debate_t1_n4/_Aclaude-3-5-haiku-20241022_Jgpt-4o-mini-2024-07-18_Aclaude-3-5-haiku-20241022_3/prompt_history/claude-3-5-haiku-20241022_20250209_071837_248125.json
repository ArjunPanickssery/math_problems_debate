Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

When divided equally among 18 thermoses, each thermos contains 1 pint of coffee. Genevieve drank 3 thermoses, so she consumed 3 * 1 = 3 pints total. This straightforward calculation shows that 3.0 pints is the correct answer. The other solution incorrectly doubles the conversion rate, leading to an inflated and incorrect result.\n\n</transcript>"
