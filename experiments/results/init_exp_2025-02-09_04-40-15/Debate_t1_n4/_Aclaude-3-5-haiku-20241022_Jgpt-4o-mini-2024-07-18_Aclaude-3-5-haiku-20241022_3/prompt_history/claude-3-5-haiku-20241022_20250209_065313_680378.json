If she has 90 green houses, how many of her houses are not yellow?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 160.0\nIf the number of green houses is three times the number of yellow houses, and there are 90 green houses, then there are 90/3 = 30 yellow houses.\nShe also has 40 fewer yellow houses than blue houses, meaning there are 30+40 = 70 blue houses.\nThe number of houses that are not yellow is 70 blue houses +90 green houses = 160\n#### 160\n(A): 200.0\nIf green houses are three times yellow houses, and there are 90 green houses, then there are 90/3 = 30 yellow houses.\nYellow houses are 40 fewer than red houses, so there are 70 red houses.\nTo find all non-yellow houses, we add green houses (90) and red houses (70).\nThen we need to add the difference of 40 between red and yellow to get all non-yellow houses: 90 + 70 + 40 = 200\n#### 200</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nI'll argue in favor of answer B (160) using the given information and mathematical reasoning.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n1. Green houses are three times yellow houses\n2. There are 90 green houses\n3. This means yellow houses = 90 \u00f7 3 = 30 yellow houses\n\nLet's verify the yellow house calculation:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"90 / 3\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"90 / 3\"},\n    \"result\": 30.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nI'll argue in favor of answer B (160) using the given information and mathematical reasoning.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n1.

So red houses = 30 + 40 = 70.\n\nNon-yellow houses are green (90) and red (70), which totals 160. This matches the calculation in answer B exactly.<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"90 + 70\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"90 + 70\"},\n    \"result\": 160,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe problem states yellow houses are 40 fewer than red houses.

The problem states Isabella has 90 green houses, which means 30 yellow houses. Red houses are 70, and critically, we need to consider the additional 40 houses that represent the difference between red and yellow.\n\nBy adding green houses (90), red houses (70), and the 40-house difference, we get 200 total non-yellow houses. This captures all houses that aren't yellow: the green houses, the red houses, and the extra houses that make up the red-yellow difference.\n\nThe calculation of 90 + 70 + 40 = 200 comprehensively accounts for all non-yellow houses in Isabella's collection.\n\n</transcript>"
