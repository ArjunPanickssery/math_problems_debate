Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Let me break this down systematically:\n\nLogan's hair is 20 inches long.

The problem states that Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's. So to find Kate's hair length:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"26 / 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"26 / 2\"},\n    \"result\": 13.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nEmily's hair is 26 inches long. The problem states that Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's. So to find Kate's hair length:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"26 / 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"26 / 2\"},\n    \"result\": 13.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nWait, this actually supports answer A (13 inches), not B (7 inches) as I initially claimed. My initial reasoning was incorrect. I apologize for the error in my previous argument.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nKate's hair length depends on Emily's hair length, which is directly related to Logan's hair. If Logan's hair is 20 inches, Emily's hair must be 6 inches longer, making it 26 inches. Since Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's, her hair would be 13 inches. The key is understanding the sequential relationships: Logan's hair sets the baseline, Emily's hair builds on that, and Kate's hair is derived from Emily's. The calculation shows 20 + 6 = 26, then 26 \u00f7 2 = 13, proving Kate's hair is 13 inches long. The step-by-step logic supports the 13-inch answer definitively.\n\n</transcript>"
