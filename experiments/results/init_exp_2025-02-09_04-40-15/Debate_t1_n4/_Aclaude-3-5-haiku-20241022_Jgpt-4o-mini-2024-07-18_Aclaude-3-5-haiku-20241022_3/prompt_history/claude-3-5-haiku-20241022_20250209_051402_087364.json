Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "I will argue in favor of answer B (16 apples) by highlighting the clear and logical reasoning in the solution:\n\nThe solution for 16 apples follows a straightforward algebraic approach. By setting up the equations A + S = 80 and A = 4S, we systematically solve for Sara's apple consumption. The key steps are:\n\n1. Total apples constraint: A + S = 80\n2. Relationship between Ali and Sara's apples: A = 4S\n3. Substituting the second equation into the first: 4S + S = 80\n4. Simplifying: 5S = 80\n5. Solving: S = 80 \u00f7 5 = 16\n\nThis method directly and unambiguously shows Sara ate 16 apples, with Ali eating the remaining 64 apples. The algebraic manipulation is clear, logical, and leads to a precise solution.",
