If Garret is currently 12, how old is Shane now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 44.0\nTwenty years ago, Shane was 12 * 2 = 24 years old\nShane is currently 24 + 20 = 44 years old\n#### 44\n(A): 64.0\nFirst, we know Shane was 2 times Garret's current age of 12\nSo Shane was 12 * 2 = 24\nThen we need to account for the twenty year difference twice\nAdding 20 years for Shane and 20 years for the time difference\nSo Shane is currently 24 + 40 = 64 years old\n#### 64</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nI'll argue for answer B (44) being the correct solution. Let me break this down systematically:\n\nTwenty years ago, Shane was 24 years old (2 times Garret's current age of 12). Let's verify the math:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 24,\n}\n</tool_result>\nI'll argue for answer B (44) being the correct solution. Let me break this down systematically:\n\nTwenty years ago, Shane was 24 years old (2 times Garret's current age of 12). Let's verify the math:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 24,\n}\n</tool_result>\nTo find Shane's current age, we simply add 20 years to his age from 20 years ago:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"24 + 20\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"24 + 20\"},\n    \"result\": 44,\n}\n</tool_result>\nTo find Shane's current age, we simply add 20 years to his age from 20 years ago:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"24 + 20\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"24 + 20\"},\n    \"result\": 44,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThis straightforward calculation shows Shane is currently 44 years old. The key is to recognize that we only need to add 20 years once, not twice as the other solution suggests. The problem statement is clear: twenty years ago, Shane was 2 times Garret's current age, so we simply add those 20 years to reach Shane's current age.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nI will argue for answer A (64.0) with the following reasoning:\n\nThe key to solving this problem is carefully tracking the age progression over time. Twenty years ago, Shane was 24 years old (2 times Garret's current age of 12). But we must account for both Shane's own aging and the time passage. When we add 20 years to Shane's age from 20 years ago (24), we get 44. However, we also need to add another 20 years to represent the total time difference, which brings Shane's current age to 64. This two-step aging process ensures we correctly calculate Shane's present age by considering both his original age and the full time elapsed.\n\n</transcript>"
