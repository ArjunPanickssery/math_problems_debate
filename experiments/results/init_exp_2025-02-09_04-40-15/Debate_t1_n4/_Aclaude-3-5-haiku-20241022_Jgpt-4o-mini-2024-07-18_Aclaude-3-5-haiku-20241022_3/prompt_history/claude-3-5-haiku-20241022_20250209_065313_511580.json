Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If she gives away half of her blue shirts and a third of her brown shirts, how many shirts does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 37.0\nMary gives away 26/2 = 13 blue shirts.\nMary gives away 36/3 = 12 brown shirts.\nMary has 26-13 = 13 blue shirts left.\nMary has 36-12 = 24 brown shirts left.\nMary has 13+24 = 37 shirts left.\n#### 37\n(A): 35.0\nMary gives away 36/2 = 18 brown shirts.\nMary gives away 26/3 \u2248 9 blue shirts.\nMary has 26-9 = 17 blue shirts left.\nMary has 36-18 = 18 brown shirts left.\nMary has 17+18 = 35 shirts left.\n#### 35</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nI'll argue for Answer A (35 shirts) with a clear and concise argument:\n\nLet's carefully verify the calculations. For blue shirts, Mary starts with 26 and gives away one-third, which is approximately 9 shirts. Let's confirm this calculation:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"26 * (1/3)\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"26 * (1/3)\"},\n    \"result\": 8.666666666666666,\n}\n</tool_result>\nI'll argue for Answer A (35 shirts) with a clear and concise argument:\n\nLet's carefully verify the calculations. For blue shirts, Mary starts with 26 and gives away one-third, which is approximately 9 shirts. Let's confirm this calculation:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"26 * (1/3)\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"26 * (1/3)\"},\n    \"result\": 8.666666666666666,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThis rounds to 9 blue shirts given away. So Mary has 26 - 9 = 17 blue shirts left.\n\nFor brown shirts, she gives away half, which is 18 shirts:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"36 * (1/2)\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"36 * (1/2)\"},\n    \"result\": 18.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThis rounds to 9 blue shirts given away. So Mary has 26 - 9 = 17 blue shirts left.\n\nFor brown shirts, she gives away half, which is 18 shirts:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"36 * (1/2)\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"36 * (1/2)\"},\n    \"result\": 18.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nSo she has 36 - 18 = 18 brown shirts left. 17 blue + 18 brown = 35 shirts total, which matches Answer A perfectly.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nI will argue for answer B (37 shirts) with a clear and concise argument:\n\nThe calculation for answer B is precise and straightforward. Mary starts with 26 blue shirts and 36 brown shirts. When she gives away half her blue shirts (13 shirts) and a third of her brown shirts (12 shirts), she is left with 13 blue shirts and 24 brown shirts. Simple addition confirms her total remaining shirts: 13 + 24 = 37 shirts. The arithmetic is clean, the steps are logical, and each calculation follows standard fraction reduction rules. The method demonstrates clear, step-by-step reasoning that leaves no room for ambiguity or error.\n\n</transcript>"

For blue shirts, Mary gives away exactly half: 26 \u00f7 2 = 13 shirts. For brown shirts, she gives away exactly one-third: 36 \u00f7 3 = 12 shirts. This precise calculation leaves her with 13 blue shirts and 24 brown shirts. \n\nLet's verify the calculations:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"26/2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>13.0</tool_result>\n<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"36/3\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>12.0</tool_result>\n\nThe previous argument for Answer A incorrectly rounded the fractions, leading to an inaccurate result.
