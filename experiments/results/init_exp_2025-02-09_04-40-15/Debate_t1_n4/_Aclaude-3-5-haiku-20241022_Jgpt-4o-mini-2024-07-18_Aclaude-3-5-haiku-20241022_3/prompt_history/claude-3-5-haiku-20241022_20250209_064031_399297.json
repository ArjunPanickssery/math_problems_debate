Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If Garret is currently 12, how old is Shane now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 44.0\nTwenty years ago, Shane was 12 * 2 = 24 years old\nShane is currently 24 + 20 = 44 years old\n#### 44\n(A): 64.0\nFirst, we know Shane was 2 times Garret's current age of 12\nSo Shane was 12 * 2 = 24\nThen we need to account for the twenty year difference twice\nAdding 20 years for Shane and 20 years for the time difference\nSo Shane is currently 24 + 40 = 64 years old\n#### 64</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nI'll argue for answer A (64.0) by carefully breaking down the reasoning:\n\nTwenty years ago, Shane was 24 years old (2 times Garret's current age of 12). Let's verify the age progression:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 24,\n}\n</tool_result>\nI'll argue for answer A (64.0) by carefully breaking down the reasoning:\n\nTwenty years ago, Shane was 24 years old (2 times Garret's current age of 12). Let's verify the age progression:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 24,\n}\n</tool_result>\nNow, we need to account for the time that has passed. Not just 20 years, but the 20 years ago context AND the current time. This means Shane has aged 40 years total:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"24 + 40\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"24 + 40\"},\n    \"result\": 64,\n}\n</tool_result>\nNow, we need to account for the time that has passed. Not just 20 years, but the 20 years ago context AND the current time. This means Shane has aged 40 years total:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"24 + 40\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"24 + 40\"},\n    \"result\": 64,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThis precisely shows why Shane is 64 years old now. The key is understanding the full time progression, not just a simple 20-year addition.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nI'll argue in favor of answer B (44) being the correct solution:\n\nThe problem clearly states that twenty years ago, Shane was 2 times older than Garret is now. Garret is currently 12, so twenty years ago, Shane was 24 years old. To find Shane's current age, we simply add 20 years to his age from that time. 24 + 20 = 44. This straightforward calculation directly follows the problem's given information without unnecessary complexity. The key is to recognize that we only need to add 20 years once to Shane's past age to determine his current age. Answer A incorrectly adds an extra 20 years, leading to an inflated and incorrect result of 64.\n\n</transcript>"
