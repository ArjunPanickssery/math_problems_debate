This means she needs 40 total classes over her college career. When we divide these 40 classes by her 8 semesters, we get exactly 5 classes per semester. \n\nThe math is precise: 40 total classes \u00f7 8 semesters = 5 classes per semester. This ensures she completes her 120-credit requirement evenly across her college years.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nMaddy needs to take 15 classes per semester to graduate on time. Here's why:\n\nFirst, let's break down the total credits needed: 120 credits are required for graduation. When we divide these credits across 8 semesters, we get 15 credits per semester (120 \u00f7 8 = 15). Since each class is 3 credits, this means Maddy must take 5 classes per semester to meet her credit requirement (15 \u00f7 3 = 5).\n\nMy opponent's calculation of 5 classes per semester is incorrect because it doesn't properly account for the total credits needed per semester. By dividing 120 credits by 8 semesters first, we ensure a precise distribution of credits across her college career.\n\n</transcript>"
