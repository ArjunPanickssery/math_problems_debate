Let me clarify the key difference. In B's solution, we're calculating the total cost as 1800, which is the total number of cards needed. This means 1800 cards at $3 per pack of 50 cards would indeed cost $1800.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nCarl needs 1800 index cards total, which requires 36 packs at $3 each. This calculation is straightforward and mathematically sound. Let's break it down step-by-step: 30 students per class \u00d7 6 periods = 180 total students. Each student gets 10 cards, so 180 \u00d7 10 = 1800 total cards needed. A pack contains 50 cards, so 1800 \u00f7 50 = 36 packs. Each pack costs $3, so 36 \u00d7 $3 = $108. The arithmetic is precise and follows logical steps. The key is recognizing how many total cards are required and then calculating the most efficient way to purchase them, which leads directly to the $108 total cost. The alternative answer of $1800 is clearly incorrect and would represent an unreasonable expenditure for classroom supplies.\n\n</transcript>"

The problem clearly states that a 50-pack of index cards costs $3, not $3 per card. The correct calculation follows the exact steps in Answer A:\n\n1. Total students: 30 \u00d7 6 = 180 students\n2. Total cards needed: 180 \u00d7 10 = 1800 cards\n3. Packs required: 1800 \u00f7 50 = 36 packs\n4. Total cost: 36 \u00d7 $3 = $108\n\nThe argument for Answer B erroneously suggests spending $1800, which would be absurd for classroom supplies. This would mean paying $3 per card instead of $3 per 50-card pack. The mathematical logic in Answer A is precise and follows the problem's given information exactly. The total cost of $108 is the only reasonable solution.",
