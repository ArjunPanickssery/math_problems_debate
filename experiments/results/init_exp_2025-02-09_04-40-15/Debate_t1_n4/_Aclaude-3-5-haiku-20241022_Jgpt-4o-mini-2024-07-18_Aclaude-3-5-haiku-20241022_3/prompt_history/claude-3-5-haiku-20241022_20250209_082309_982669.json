The calculation directly follows the problem statement, considering both his hourly rate and hours worked, then multiplying by the number of weeks in a year. The method systematically breaks down the earnings difference, making 20,800 the correct answer.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nI'll argue in favor of answer A (8320):\n\nThe key to solving this problem is calculating the incremental increase in Jame's annual earnings. By focusing on the per-hour wage difference, we can precisely track his raise. The wage difference is $4 per hour (from $16 to $20), and he now works 40 hours instead of 25. Multiplying the $4 difference by 40 hours gives $160 additional weekly earnings. When we extend this to a full year of 52 weeks, $160 * 52 = $8,320. This method directly calculates the marginal increase in his annual income, capturing the true impact of his raise by examining the hourly wage differential multiplied by his new work hours and annual weeks.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward: ($20 - $16) * 40 hours * 52 weeks = $8,320, making answer A the correct choice.\n\n</transcript>"

This method fails to account for the total weekly earnings. The correct approach is to compare the full weekly earnings of both jobs. In the new job, Jame earns $800 per week (20 * 40), while in the old job, he earned $400 per week (16 * 25). The difference in weekly earnings is $400, which when multiplied by 52 weeks, results in $20,800 of additional annual income. ",
