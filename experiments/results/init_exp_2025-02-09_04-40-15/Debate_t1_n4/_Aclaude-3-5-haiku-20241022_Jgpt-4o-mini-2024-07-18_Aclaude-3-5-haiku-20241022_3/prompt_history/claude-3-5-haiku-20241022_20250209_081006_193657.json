This is calculated by finding the hourly rate increase ($4), multiplying by weekly hours (40), then by weeks per year (52). The method is straightforward and mathematically sound.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nI'll argue for answer B (20,800) being the correct solution:\n\nThe key to solving this problem is calculating total annual income for both jobs and finding the difference. At the new job, Jame earns $800 per week ($20 * 40 hours), which over 52 weeks becomes $41,600 annually. At his old job, he earned $400 per week ($16 * 25 hours), which translates to $20,800 annually. The difference between these annual incomes is exactly $20,800, which matches our answer. This method directly calculates the total yearly earnings and shows the precise increase in Jame's annual income, making answer B the most accurate representation of his pay raise.\n\n</transcript>"
