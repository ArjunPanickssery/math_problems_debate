In Answer A, we calculate the broken crayons from the remaining 80 crayons, not the total 120, which results in 64 slightly used crayons. This approach is more precise and accounts for the proportions more accurately.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nI'll argue for answer B (56 crayons):\n\nThe solution for 56 crayons is straightforward and follows direct calculation from the total number of crayons. We start with 120 total crayons, then subtract the known quantities systematically. One-third of 120 is 40 new crayons, and 20% of 120 is 24 broken crayons. By directly subtracting these from the total (120 - 40 - 24), we arrive precisely at 56 slightly used crayons. This method ensures we account for every crayon in the box without any intermediate steps that could introduce calculation errors. The arithmetic is clean, direct, and leaves no room for misinterpretation.\n\n</transcript>"

By calculating the broken and new crayons directly from the total 120 crayons, we eliminate potential sources of error. One-third of 120 is 40 new crayons, and 20% of 120 is 24 broken crayons. Subtracting these from the total gives exactly 56 slightly used crayons. \n\nThe method in Answer A introduces an unnecessary intermediate step by first removing new crayons and then calculating broken crayons from the remaining 80, which complicates the calculation and potentially introduces rounding or proportional errors.
