My initial reasoning for B was incorrect. The number of boys is indeed 25, not 33.33. The total students is 100, with 25 boys and 75 girls, which satisfies the condition of three times as many girls as boys.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe key to solving this problem is carefully parsing the relationships between students. The Physics class has 200 students, and the Biology class has half that number, which is 100 students. Given that there are three times as many girls as boys, we can set up an algebraic equation. Let x be the number of boys. Then 3x represents the number of girls. Together, x + 3x = 100 students. Solving this: 4x = 100, so x = 25. This directly proves that there are 25 boys in the Biology class. The step-by-step logic is clear and mathematically sound, making 25 the correct answer.\n\n</transcript>"

Let's solve algebraically. If x represents boys, then 3x represents girls. Their total must equal 100:\n\nx + 3x = 100\n4x = 100\nx = 25\n\nThis proves 25 boys are in the class. The solution satisfies both conditions: total students (25 + 75 = 100) and the girl-to-boy ratio (75/25 = 3). The arithmetic is straightforward and unambiguous, making 25 the correct answer.",
