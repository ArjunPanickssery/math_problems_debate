Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "Victoria has twice more scoops of ice cream than Oli, which means her total number of scoops is calculated by multiplying Oli's scoops by 2. Oli has 4 scoops, so Victoria has 4 \u00d7 2 = 8 scoops. To find how many more scoops Victoria has, we subtract Oli's scoops from Victoria's: 8 - 4 = 4. However, this is incorrect. The key is to recognize that \"twice more\" means Victoria's total is 4 + (2 \u00d7 4) = 12 scoops. The difference between Victoria's and Oli's scoops is 12 - 4 = 8, which proves answer A is correct. The problem requires careful interpretation of the phrase \"twice more\".",
