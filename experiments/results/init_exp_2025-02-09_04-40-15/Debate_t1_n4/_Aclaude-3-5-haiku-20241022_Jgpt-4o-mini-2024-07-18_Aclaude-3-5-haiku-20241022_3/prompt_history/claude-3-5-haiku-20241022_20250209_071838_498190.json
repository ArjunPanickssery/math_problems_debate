The raw difference is 6 books.

The percentage difference becomes more significant when contextualized by the total collection size.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nPeter has read 8 books (20 x 0.4 = 8), while his brother has read 2 books (20 x 0.1 = 2). The straightforward calculation shows that Peter has read 6 more books than his brother. The problem directly asks how many more books Peter has read, which is simply 8 - 2 = 6. The proposed alternative answer of 120 involves an unnecessary and incorrect multiplication that distorts the simple arithmetic. The question requires a direct comparison of the number of books read, not a scaling operation. The calculation is clear and direct: 6 books represent the actual difference in books read between Peter and his brother.\n\n</transcript>"
