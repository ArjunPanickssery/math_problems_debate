Two parts remain unused, which means 2 \u00d7 7.5 = 15 meters of ribbon are not used. This confirms the answer of 15.0.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nI'll argue in favor of answer A (10.0 meters):\n\nThe solution is straightforward. Isaac cut his 30-meter ribbon into 6 equal parts, which means each part is exactly 5 meters long (30 \u00f7 6 = 5). When he used 4 parts, he consumed 20 meters of the ribbon (5 \u00d7 4 = 20). This leaves 10 meters of ribbon unused (30 - 20 = 10). The calculation is precise and follows clear mathematical logic. The key steps are dividing the total length equally, calculating used length, and then subtracting from the total. Answer A provides the correct, step-by-step reasoning that leads to the accurate result of 10 meters of unused ribbon.\n\n</transcript>"
