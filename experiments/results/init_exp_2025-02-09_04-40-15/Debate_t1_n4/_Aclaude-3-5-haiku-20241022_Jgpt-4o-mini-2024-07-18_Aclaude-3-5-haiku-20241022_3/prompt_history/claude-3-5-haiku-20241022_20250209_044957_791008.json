Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "I will argue for answer A (810.0), which represents a different calculation method for Brianne's monthly savings.\n\nMy argument is that the calculation for A considers cumulative savings rather than just the monthly amount. In this interpretation, Brianne doesn't just double her monthly savings, but increases her total savings by a factor of 3 each month. \n\nLet's break it down:\n- January: $10 start\n- February: $10 + $20 = $30 total\n- March: $30 + $60 = $90 total\n- April: $90 + $180 = $270 total\n- May: $270 + $540 = $810 total\n\nThis approach shows exponential growth where each month's new savings are added to the previous total, not just doubling the previous month's savings. The key difference is in how \"twice as much\" is interpreted - as a total growth or just the new monthly amount.\n\nThe mathematical logic supports this interpretation of compound savings growth.",
