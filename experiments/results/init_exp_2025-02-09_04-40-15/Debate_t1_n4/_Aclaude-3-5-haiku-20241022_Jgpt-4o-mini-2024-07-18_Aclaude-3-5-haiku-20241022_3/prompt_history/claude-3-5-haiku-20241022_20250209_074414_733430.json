Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The step-by-step calculation matches the problem statement perfectly.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nIsabel started with $408. Here's why: When she first spent half her money on a toy, she was left with $204. Then she spent half of that $204 on a book for her brother, leaving her with $102. Finally, she spent half again, resulting in $51 remaining. By working backwards systematically, we can trace her spending: $408 \u2192 $204 \u2192 $102 \u2192 $51. Each step involves halving the previous amount. This methodical approach proves that her initial amount was $408, not $204. The key is understanding the sequential halving of her money through each purchase, which directly leads to the $408 starting point.\n\n</transcript>"
