Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The solution is mathematically sound and precise.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nI will argue in favor of answer A (274 apples).\n\nThe solution for answer A correctly sets up the algebraic equation by defining x as Kylie's apples and expressing Kayla's apples as 10 + 4x. This directly matches the problem statement that Kayla picked \"10 more than 4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked\".\n\nWhen solving the equation 340 = x + (10 + 4x), the steps are mathematically sound:\n1. 340 = x + 10 + 4x\n2. 340 = 5x + 10\n3. 330 = 5x\n4. x = 66 (Kylie's apples)\n5. Kayla's apples = 10 + 4(66) = 274\n\nThe algebra is precise, the logic follows the problem description exactly, and the final calculation of 274 apples for Kayla is correct. The solution demonstrates clear, step-by-step reasoning that directly solves the problem as stated.\n\n</transcript>"
