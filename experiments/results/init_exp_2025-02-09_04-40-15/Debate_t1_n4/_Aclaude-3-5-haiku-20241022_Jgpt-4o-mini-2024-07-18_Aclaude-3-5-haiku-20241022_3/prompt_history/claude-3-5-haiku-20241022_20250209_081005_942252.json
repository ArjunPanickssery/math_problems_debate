At the new job, Jame earns $800 per week ($20 * 40 hours), which over 52 weeks becomes $41,600 annually. At his old job, he earned $400 per week ($16 * 25 hours), which translates to $20,800 annually. The difference between these annual incomes is exactly $20,800, which matches our answer. This method directly calculates the total yearly earnings and shows the precise increase in Jame's annual income, making answer B the most accurate representation of his pay raise.\n\n</transcript>"
