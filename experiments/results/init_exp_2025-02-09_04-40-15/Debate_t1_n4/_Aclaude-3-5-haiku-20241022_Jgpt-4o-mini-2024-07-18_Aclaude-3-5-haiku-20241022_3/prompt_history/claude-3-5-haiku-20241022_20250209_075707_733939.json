The key is understanding that the 12 marbles are what Amanda needs to reach twice Katrina's marbles, not her current count.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nI'll argue in favor of Answer A (63.0):\n\nThe key to solving this problem is carefully tracking the marble counts for each person. Mabel has 85 marbles, which is 5 times Katrina's marble count. This means Katrina has 17 marbles. Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice Katrina's marbles, so Amanda currently has 22 marbles (34 - 12 = 22). The difference between Mabel's 85 marbles and Amanda's 22 marbles is precisely 63 marbles. The step-by-step calculation shows a clear, logical progression that confirms 63 as the correct number of additional marbles Mabel has compared to Amanda. The arithmetic is straightforward and leaves no room for alternative interpretations.\n\n</transcript>"
