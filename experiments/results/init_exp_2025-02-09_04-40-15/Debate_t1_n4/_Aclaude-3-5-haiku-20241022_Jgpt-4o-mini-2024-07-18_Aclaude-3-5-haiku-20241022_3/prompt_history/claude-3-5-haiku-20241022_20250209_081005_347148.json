Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many strings does he need?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 72.0\nThe basses take 3*4=12 strings\nHe restrings 2*3=6 normal guitars\nThat takes 6*6=36 strings\nHe restrings 6-3=3 guitars with 8 strings\nSo that uses 3*8=24 strings\nSo he uses 12+36+24=72 strings\n#### 72\n(B): 96.0\nThe basses take 3*4=12 strings\nHe restrings 2*3=6 normal guitars\nThat takes 6*6=36 strings\nFor 8-string guitars, we need 6 guitars\nSo that uses 6*8=48 strings\nSo he uses 12+36+48=96 strings\n#### 96</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nI'll argue for Answer A (72 strings) being the correct solution. Let me break down the reasoning step-by-step:\n\nJohn has 3 basses with 4 strings each, which means 3 * 4 = 12 bass strings. \n\nFor guitars, he has twice as many normal guitars as basses. Since he has 3 basses, that means 6 normal guitars with 6 strings each. Let's verify the guitar string count:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"6 * 6\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"6 * 6\"},\n    \"result\": 36,\n}\n</tool_result>\nI'll argue for Answer A (72 strings) being the correct solution.

So if he has 6 normal guitars, he'll have 6 - 3 = 3 eight-string guitars. Let's calculate those strings:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"3 * 8\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"3 * 8\"},\n    \"result\": 24,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe problem states he has 3 fewer 8-string guitars than normal guitars.

The key is understanding the relationships between the number of basses, normal guitars, and 8-string guitars.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nI'll argue in favor of answer B (96 strings) with a clear and concise argument:\n\nThe key to solving this problem is carefully tracking the number of guitars at each stage. The problem states John has 3 basses, twice as many guitars (which would be 6 guitars), and 3 fewer 8-string guitars than normal guitars. \n\nIn answer A, the calculation for 8-string guitars is incorrect. If there are 6 normal guitars, then there must be 3 eight-string guitars (6 - 3 = 3), not the 3 stated in answer A. When we calculate the strings for 8-string guitars, it's 6 * 8 = 48 strings, not 24.\n\nThe full calculation is:\n- Basses: 3 * 4 = 12 strings\n- Normal guitars: 6 * 6 = 36 strings\n- 8-string guitars: 6 * 8 = 48 strings\n\nTotal: 12 + 36 + 48 = 96 strings, which matches answer B.\n\n</transcript>"
