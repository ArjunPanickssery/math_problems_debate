The total is 9 + 36 = 45, not 22. Answer B is incorrect.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nAlbert has 4 times as many books as Stu, which means 4 * 9 = 36 books. This is straightforward multiplication. When we add Stu's original 9 books to Albert's 36 books, we get a total of 45 books. The problem clearly states that Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu, so multiplying Stu's book count by 4 gives us Albert's book count. Simple arithmetic shows that 9 + 36 = 45, making 45 the correct total number of books for both Stu and Albert combined.\n\n</transcript>"
