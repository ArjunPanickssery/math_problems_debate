The calculation follows the problem's conditions precisely: 13 pink marbles, 4 orange marbles (9 fewer than pink), and 16 purple marbles (4 times orange). The step-by-step approach clearly demonstrates why 33 is the correct total.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nMy argument for Answer A (123 marbles):\n\nThe key to solving this problem is carefully interpreting the relationships between marble colors. The problem states Katie has 13 pink marbles, and 9 FEWER orange marbles than pink marbles. This means her orange marble count is actually 13 + 9 = 22 marbles, not 13 - 9 = 4 as the other solution suggests. Then, she has 4 times as many purple marbles as orange marbles, which calculates to 22 \u00d7 4 = 88 purple marbles. Adding these together: 13 pink + 22 orange + 88 purple = 123 total marbles. The alternative solution incorrectly subtracts instead of adds when determining orange marble count, leading to a significantly lower and incorrect total.\n\n</transcript>"
