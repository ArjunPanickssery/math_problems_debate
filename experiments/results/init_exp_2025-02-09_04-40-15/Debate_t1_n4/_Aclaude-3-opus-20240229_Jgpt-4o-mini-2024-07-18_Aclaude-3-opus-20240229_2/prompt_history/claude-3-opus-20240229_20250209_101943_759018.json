Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many students played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 65.0\n37 - 9 = 28 students played kickball on Thursday.\nSo, 37 + 28 = 65 students played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday.\n#### 65\n(A): 83.0\nOn Thursday, there was a difference of 9 students, so 37 + 9 = 46 students played on Thursday.\nTherefore, 37 + 46 = 83 students played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday.\n#### 83</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"

So even if some students played both days, they would be double counted in the total.\n</thinking>\n\nThe key point is that the question asks for the total number of students who played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday, not the number of unique students. \n\nOn Wednesday there were 37 students.
