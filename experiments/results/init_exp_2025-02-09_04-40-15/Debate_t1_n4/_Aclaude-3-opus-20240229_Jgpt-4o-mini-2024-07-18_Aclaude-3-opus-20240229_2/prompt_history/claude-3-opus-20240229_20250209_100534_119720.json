Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key pieces of information given are:\n- Haley has 5 more necklaces than Jason\n- Josh has half the number of necklaces as Jason\n- Haley has 25 necklaces\n\nTo determine how many more necklaces Haley has than Josh, we first need to calculate how many necklaces Jason and Josh each have. \n\nSince Haley has 25 necklaces and she has 5 more than Jason, we can calculate Jason's necklaces by subtracting 5 from Haley's:\n25 - 5 = 20\nSo Jason has 20 necklaces.\n\nWe're told Josh has half the number of necklaces as Jason. To calculate half of Jason's necklaces, we can divide Jason's necklaces by 2:\n20 / 2 = 10\nSo Josh has 10 necklaces.\n\nNow that we know Haley has 25 necklaces and Josh has 10, we can subtract to find how many more Haley has than Josh:\n25 - 10 = 15\n\nTherefore, the information supports answer choice (B) that Haley has 15 more necklaces than Josh. The math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations, but it's not strictly necessary since the math is simple enough to do without it.\n</thinking>\n\nHaley has 25 necklaces and Jason has 5 fewer than her, so Jason must have 20 necklaces.
