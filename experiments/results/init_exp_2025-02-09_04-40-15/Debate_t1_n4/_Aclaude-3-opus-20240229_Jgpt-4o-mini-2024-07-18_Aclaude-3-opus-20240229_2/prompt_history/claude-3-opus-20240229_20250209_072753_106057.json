Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The total can be calculated by multiplying the number of plants per batch (2) by the number of batches per year (2) to get the number of plants per year (4). Then multiply that by the number of years (4) to get the total.\n\nThe expression to evaluate would be: 2 * 2 * 4\n\nNo additional tools or information are needed. We can proceed with the math_eval tool call.\n</thinking>",
