Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The number of roosters\n3. The number of hens that do not lay eggs\n\nThe question provides all of this information directly:\n- There are 325 total chickens \n- 28 are roosters\n- 20 hens do not lay eggs\n\nWith this, we can calculate the number of egg-laying hens:\n1. Total hens = Total chickens - Roosters\n2. Egg-laying hens = Total hens - Non-laying hens\n\nNo tools are needed, as the question provides the necessary information and only simple arithmetic is required.\n</thinking>\n\nMr. Curtis has a total of 325 chickens on his farm. Out of these, 28 are roosters. \nTo calculate the total number of hens, we take the total chickens and subtract the number of roosters:",
