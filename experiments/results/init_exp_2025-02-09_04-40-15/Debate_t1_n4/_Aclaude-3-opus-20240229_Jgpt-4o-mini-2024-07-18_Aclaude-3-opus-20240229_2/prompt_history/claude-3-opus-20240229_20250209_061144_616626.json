Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Determine how many bags he ate after dinner by doubling the number he ate for dinner\n2. Add the bags eaten for dinner and after dinner together\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations, but all the necessary information is already provided in the question.

To determine how many bags he ate after dinner, we simply need to double the 1 bag he ate for dinner:",
