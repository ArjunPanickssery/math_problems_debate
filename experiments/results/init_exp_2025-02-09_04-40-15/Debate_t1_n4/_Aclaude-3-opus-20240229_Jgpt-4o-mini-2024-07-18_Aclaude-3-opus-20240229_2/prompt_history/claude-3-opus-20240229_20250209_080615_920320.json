Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The original price of the shoes must have been $600. If Lyra paid $480 after a 20% discount, that means she paid 80% of the original price. To find the original 100% price, we divide the discounted price of $480 by 0.8, which equals $600. The other answer incorrectly calculates the discount based on the discounted price rather than the original price. A 20% discount on $480 would be $96, but adding that to $480 does not give the correct original price before the discount was applied.",
