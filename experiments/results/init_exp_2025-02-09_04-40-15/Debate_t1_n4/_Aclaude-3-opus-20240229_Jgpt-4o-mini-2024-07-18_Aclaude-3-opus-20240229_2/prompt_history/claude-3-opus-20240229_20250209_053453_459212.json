          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key pieces of information needed to determine the correct answer are:\n- The total length of rope needed (60 feet, since 1 story is 10 feet and Tom needs to lower the rope 6 stories)\n- The length of each piece of rope being sold (20 feet) \n- The percentage of rope length lost when lashing pieces together (25%)\n\nWith those details, we can calculate:\n- Effective length of each rope piece after lashing = 20 feet * (1 - 0.25) = 15 feet\n- Number of 15 foot pieces needed to reach 60 feet total = 60 feet / 15 feet per piece = 4 pieces\n\nSo the information supports that answer B (4 pieces of rope) is correct, while answer A fails to account for the 25% of length lost when lashing the ropes together. No tools are needed since the question provides all necessary information and only requires basic math that I can do myself.\n</thinking>\n\nAnswer B is correct that Tom will need to buy 4 pieces of rope, not 3. Here's why:\n\nThe question states that Tom needs to lower the rope down 6 stories, and that each story is 10 feet tall. So the total length of rope he needs is 6 * 10 = 60 feet.\n\nHowever, the rope is only sold in 20 foot pieces. If Tom simply divided 60 by 20, he would get 3, which is answer A. But this fails to account for the critical detail that he loses 25% of the length each time he lashes pieces of rope together.\n\n25% of 20 feet is 5 feet. So each time Tom lashes two 20 foot pieces together, the effective usable length is only 20 - 5 = 15 feet.\n\nTo get 60 feet total from 15 foot effective pieces, Tom needs 60 / 15 = 4 pieces of rope, which is answer B.\n\nSo in summary, answer B correctly recognizes the 25% loss from lashing and determines Tom needs 4 pieces, while answer A incorrectly assumes he can use the full 20 foot length of each piece.",
