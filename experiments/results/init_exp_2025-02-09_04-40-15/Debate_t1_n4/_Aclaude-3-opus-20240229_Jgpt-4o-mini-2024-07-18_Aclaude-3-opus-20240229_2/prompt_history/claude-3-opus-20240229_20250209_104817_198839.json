Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many square inches of the box are left uncovered?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 8.0\nThe shoebox is 24 square inches because 4 x 6 = 24\nThe block is 16 square inches because 4 x 4 = 16\nThere are 8 square inches uncovered because 24 - 16 = 8\n#### 8\n(B): 4\nThe shoebox perimeter is 20 (4 + 6) \u00d7 2\nThe block perimeter is 16: 4 \u00d7 4\nThe uncovered space is 20 - 16\n#### 4</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"
