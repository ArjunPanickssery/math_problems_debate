This month\u2019s pig is a runt that grew to only half the size of the average pig. How many dollars will the farmer make from the pig\u2019s bacon?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nThe pig grew to half the size of the average pig, so it will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nThe rancher will make 10 * 6 = $60 from the pig\u2019s bacon.\n#### 60\n(A): 30.0\nThe pig will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nEach pound will sell for 6 / 2 = $3.\nThe farmer will make 10 * 3 = $30 from the pig's bacon.\n#### 30</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"

Calculate how many pounds of bacon the runt pig will produce, given it is half the size of an average pig\n2. Multiply the number of pounds of bacon by the price per pound to get the total revenue\n\nThe question does not mention anything about the price per pound changing for the runt pig. So we can assume the $6 per pound price still applies.\n\nTherefore, the relevant calculation is:\n1. Runt pig bacon amount = 20 pounds / 2 = 10 pounds \n2. Revenue = 10 pounds * $6 per pound = $60\n\nNo additional information or tool use seems necessary. The question provides all the required information to calculate the final dollar amount directly.\n</thinking>\n\nThe runt pig will produce half as much bacon as a typical pig. Since a typical pig produces 20 pounds of bacon, the runt pig will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\n\nThe question states that the farmer sells each pound of bacon for $6. There is no indication that the price per pound changes for the runt pig. \n\nTherefore, the farmer will make:",
