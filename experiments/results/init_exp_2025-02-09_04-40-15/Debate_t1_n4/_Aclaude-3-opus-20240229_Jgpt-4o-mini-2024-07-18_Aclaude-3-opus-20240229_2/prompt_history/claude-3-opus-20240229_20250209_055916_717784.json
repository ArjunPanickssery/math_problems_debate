Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

To determine the correct answer, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling 18 watermelons at $2 per pound, with each watermelon weighing 23 pounds.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1. Calculate the price per watermelon (23 pounds * $2/pound)\n2. Multiply the price per watermelon by the number of watermelons sold (18)\n\nBoth of these steps can be done with the math_eval tool. The required \"expr\" parameter can be inferred from the question text.\n</thinking>",
