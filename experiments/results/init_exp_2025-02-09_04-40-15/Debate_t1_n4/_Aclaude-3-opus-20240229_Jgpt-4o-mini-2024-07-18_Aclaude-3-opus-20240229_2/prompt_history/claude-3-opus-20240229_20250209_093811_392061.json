          "content": "<thinking>\nTo determine which answer to argue for, I need to carefully analyze the given information and the reasoning in each answer.\n\nThe key pieces of information are:\n- Kylie and Kayla picked a total of 340 apples\n- Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the amount Kylie picked\n\nAnswer A interprets this as Kayla picking 10 + 4x apples, where x is the number Kylie picked. \nAnswer B interprets it as Kayla picking 4(x+10) apples.\n\nTo determine which is the correct interpretation, I'll try plugging in some example numbers:\nLet's say Kylie picked 10 apples.\nBy A's interpretation, Kayla would have picked 10 + 4(10) = 50 apples\nBy B's interpretation, Kayla would have picked 4(10+10) = 80 apples\n\n80 apples seems to match the phrase \"10 more than 4 times\" better. \"4 times\" should apply to the whole amount Kylie picked, not just multiply her amount by 4.\n\nSo B's interpretation of 4(x+10) seems more reasonable. I'll argue that B is correct.\n</thinking>\n\nThe correct answer is B, that Kayla picked 280 apples. The question states that \"Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked\". \n\nThis means if Kylie picked x apples, then Kayla picked 4(x+10) apples. We can set up the equation:\n340 = x + 4(x+10)\n\nDistributing the 4 gives:\n340 = x + 4x + 40\n340 = 5x + 40\n\nSubtracting 40 from both sides:\n300 = 5x\n\nDividing by 5:\nx = 60\n\nSo Kylie picked 60 apples. Plugging this back in, Kayla picked:\n4(60+10) = 4(70) = 280 apples\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is that Kayla picked 4 times Kylie's amount plus 10, not 4 times Kylie's amount plus 10. Answer B correctly reasons this out to determine Kayla picked 280 apples.",
