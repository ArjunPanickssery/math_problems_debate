Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Calculate how many matches he won in the first 100 matches (100 * 50% = 50 matches)\n2. Calculate how many matches he won in the next 100 matches (100 * 60% = 60 matches) \n3. Add those two numbers together to get the total\nThis matches the approach in answer choice B. No tools are needed, as the math is simple enough to do by hand or mentally.\n</thinking>\n\nSam won 50 matches in his first 100 games, as 100 * 0.5 = 50. In his next 100 games, he won 60 matches, since 100 * 0.6 = 60. Therefore, in total across the 200 games, Sam won 50 + 60 = 110 matches. The approach in answer A is incorrect because it assumes Sam won 60% of matches across all 200 games, but the question clearly states he had different win rates in each 100 game set. 110 is the correct total number of matches won.",
