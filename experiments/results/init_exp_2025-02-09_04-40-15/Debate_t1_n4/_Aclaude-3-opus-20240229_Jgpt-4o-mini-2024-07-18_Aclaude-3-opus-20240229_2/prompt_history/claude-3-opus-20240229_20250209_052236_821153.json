Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The question says there are 6 more green bowling balls than red. So to calculate the number of green balls, I need to add 6 to the number of red balls (30).\n3. To get the total number of bowling balls, I need to add the number of red balls and green balls together.\nNo tools are needed to make this argument, as it can be done with simple arithmetic based on the information provided in the question.\n</thinking>\n\nThe question clearly states there are 30 red bowling balls. To determine the number of green balls, we need to add 6 to the number of red balls, since it says there are 6 more green than red. So 30 red balls + 6 = 36 green balls.\n\nTo get the total, we add the number of red balls (30) and green balls (36) together:\n30 + 36 = 66 total bowling balls\n\nTherefore, the total number of bowling balls is 66, so answer B is correct.",
