Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

This means the total cost of the sodas was $2, not $1 as assumed in answer A.\n\nAnswer B correctly calculates the cost of the items as:\n$6 (chicken wings) + $4 (chicken salad) + $2 (2 sodas at $1 each) = $12 \n\nIt then adds the $3 tax to get a total bill of $15. \n\nSince Lee and his friend pooled $18 total, the change they should receive is $18 - $15 = $3.\n\nTherefore, answer B which concludes they should receive $3 in change is correct. Answer A incorrectly assumes only 1 soda was purchased, leading to the wrong change amount.",
