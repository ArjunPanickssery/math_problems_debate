Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The key information provided is:\n- There are 12 burrs \n- There are six times as many ticks as burrs\nTo calculate the total number of objects, I need to:\n1. Calculate the number of ticks based on the number of burrs\n2. Add the number of ticks to the number of burrs\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations.
