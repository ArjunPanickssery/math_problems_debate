Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If there are 45 pirates, then the number of noodles must be 45 minus 7, which equals 38 noodles. To find the total number of noodles and pirates, we simply add the number of noodles (38) and the number of pirates (45) together: 38 + 45 = 83. Therefore, the correct answer is that there are 83 noodles and pirates in total in the matrix.",
