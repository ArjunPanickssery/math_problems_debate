Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The key information needed is:\nOriginal price: $350\nSale price: $140\nTo calculate the percentage off, we need to:\n1. Find the difference between the original price and sale price. This gives the dollar amount saved.\n2. Divide the dollar amount saved by the original price. This gives the percentage saved as a decimal. \n3. Multiply by 100 to convert the decimal to a percentage.\nAll the necessary information is provided, so we can proceed with the math_eval tool calls to calculate the percentage.\n</thinking>",
