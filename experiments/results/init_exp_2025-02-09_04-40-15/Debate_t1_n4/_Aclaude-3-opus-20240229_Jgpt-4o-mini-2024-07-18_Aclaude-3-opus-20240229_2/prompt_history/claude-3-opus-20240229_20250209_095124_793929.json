Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "Sara ate 16 apples. Here's why:\n\nWe know Ali and Sara ate a total of 80 apples, and that Ali ate 4 times as many apples as Sara. Let's call the number of apples Sara ate 'S'. Since Ali ate 4 times as many, he ate 4S apples.\n\nSo the total apples is S + 4S, which equals 5S. We're told this equals 80. So:\n\n5S = 80\nDividing both sides by 5:\nS = 80/5 = 16\n\nTherefore, Sara ate 16 apples, and Ali ate 4*16 = 64 apples, for a total of 80.",
