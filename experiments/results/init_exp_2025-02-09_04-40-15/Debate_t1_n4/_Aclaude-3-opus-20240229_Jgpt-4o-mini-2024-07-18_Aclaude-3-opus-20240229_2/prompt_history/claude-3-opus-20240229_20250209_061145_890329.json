Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Calculate Shane's age 20 years ago based on Garret's current age\n2. Add 20 years to Shane's age from 20 years ago to get his current age\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The required parameter is the mathematical expression to evaluate.\nFor step 1, the expression would be 12 * 2 to calculate Shane's age 20 years ago.\nFor step 2, the expression would be the result from step 1 + 20.\nBoth of these expressions can be constructed from the information provided in the question, so no additional information is needed from the user. We can proceed with the tool calls in this order.\n</thinking>",
