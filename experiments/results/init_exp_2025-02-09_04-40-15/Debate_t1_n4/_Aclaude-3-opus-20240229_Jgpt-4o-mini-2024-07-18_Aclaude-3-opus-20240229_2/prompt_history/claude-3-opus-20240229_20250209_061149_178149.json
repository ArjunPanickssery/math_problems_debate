Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question is asking how many of Sam's cows are not black, given that 5 more than half the cows are black. \n\nTo determine the number of non-black cows, we need to:\n1. Calculate the total number of cows (given as 18)\n2. Calculate half the total number of cows \n3. Add 5 to half the total to get the number of black cows\n4. Subtract the number of black cows from the total to get the number of non-black cows\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform the calculations in steps 2-4. The total number of cows (18) is directly provided in the question.\n\nSo the math_eval tool has all the required inputs to calculate the final answer. No other tools are needed.\n</thinking>",
