Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Since he has 10 blue envelopes, to find the number of yellow envelopes we subtract 4 from 10. This gives us 6 yellow envelopes. To find the total number of envelopes, we add the number of blue envelopes (10) and the number of yellow envelopes (6). This results in a total of 16 envelopes.",
