          "content": "The correct answer is B: 658 dolls total. Here's why:\n\nThe grandmother has 50 dolls. Rene's sister has 2 more dolls than the grandmother, so she has 50 + 2 = 52 dolls. \n\nNow, the key is that Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister. Since her sister has 52 dolls, Rene must have 52 * 3 = 156 dolls.\n\nTherefore, the total number of dolls is the sum of the grandmother's dolls (50), Rene's sister's dolls (52), and Rene's dolls (156). This adds up to 50 + 52 + 156 = 658 dolls altogether.\n\nThe other answer incorrectly calculates Rene's dolls by multiplying the grandmother's 50 dolls by 3, rather than multiplying her sister's 52 dolls by 3 to get Rene's doll count. This is the critical mistake in their reasoning.",
