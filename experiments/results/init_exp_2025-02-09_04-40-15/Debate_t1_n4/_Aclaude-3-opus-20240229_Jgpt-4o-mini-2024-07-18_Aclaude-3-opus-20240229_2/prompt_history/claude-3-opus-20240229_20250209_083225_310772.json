Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

To determine the fraction she has left, we can subtract the spent fraction from 1 (which represents the whole amount):\n\n1 - 2/3 = 1/3 \n\nSo the housewife has 1/3 of her original money left.\n\nTo calculate the dollar amount remaining, we multiply the original total by the remaining fraction:\n\n$150 * (1/3) = $50\n\nThis matches the result I am supposed to argue for, so no additional tools are needed. The key steps are determining the remaining fraction and multiplying that by the original total.\n</thinking>\n\nThe housewife spent 2/3 of her $150, which means she has 1/3 of it left.
