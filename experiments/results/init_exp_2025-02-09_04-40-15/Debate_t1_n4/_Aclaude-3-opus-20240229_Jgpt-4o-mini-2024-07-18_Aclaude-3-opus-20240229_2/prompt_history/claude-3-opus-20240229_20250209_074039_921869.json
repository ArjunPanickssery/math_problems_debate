Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Calculate the total number of students in the Biology class (using the number of Physics students)\n2. Use the ratio of girls to boys to determine what fraction of the Biology class are boys\n3. Multiply the total Biology students by the fraction that are boys to get the number of boys\n\nThe given tools do not seem directly relevant, as this is more of a logic problem that can be solved with the given information and basic math operations. The key will be correctly setting up the equations based on the provided ratios and totals.\n</thinking>\n\nThere are 25 boys in the Biology class.
