Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The price each company charges per bottle \n2. The number of bottles each company sold\nWe are given both of these directly in the question. Company A charges $4 per bottle and sold 300 bottles. Company B charges $3.5 per bottle and sold 350 bottles.\nTo calculate the difference in earnings between the two companies, we need to:\n1. Calculate the total revenue for each company by multiplying price per bottle by number of bottles sold\n2. Subtract the smaller revenue amount from the larger to get the difference\nNo additional information or tool calls are needed. We have everything required to calculate the difference in earnings.\n</thinking>",
