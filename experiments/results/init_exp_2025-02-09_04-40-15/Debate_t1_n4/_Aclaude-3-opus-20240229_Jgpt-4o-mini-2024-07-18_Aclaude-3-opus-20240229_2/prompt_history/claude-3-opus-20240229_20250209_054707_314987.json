          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key difference between the two answers is how they divide the total number of apples. Answer A divides the total apples by 2 since there are 2 people eating them, while answer B uses the total number of apples without dividing by the number of people.\n\nTo determine which approach is correct, I need to carefully consider the phrasing of the question. It asks \"how many weeks can Henry and his brother spend eating 3 boxes of apples if they each eat 1 apple a day?\" The key part is \"if they each eat 1 apple a day\". This means that together, Henry and his brother will be eating 2 apples per day total.\n\nSo the correct approach is to take the total number of apples (42) and divide by the number of apples eaten per day by both people together (2). This matches the approach in answer B.\n\nNo tools are needed to solve this, as the question provides all the necessary information and only requires basic arithmetic that I can do in my head.\n</thinking>\n\nThe correct answer is B. Here's why:\n\nThere are a total of 14 apples per box, and 3 boxes, so 14 * 3 = 42 apples total. \n\nThe question states that Henry and his brother each eat 1 apple per day. So together, they are eating 2 apples per day.\n\nTo calculate the number of weeks the apples will last, we divide the total apples by the number of apples eaten per day:\n\n42 apples / (2 apples per day) = 21 days \n\nSince there are 7 days in a week, we divide the number of days by 7:\n\n21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks\n\nTherefore, the 3 boxes of apples will last Henry and his brother 3 weeks.",
