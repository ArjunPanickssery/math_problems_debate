          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question asks how much money Isabel had at first, given that she spent half of it on a toy, then half of the remaining amount on a book for her brother, and now has $51 left.\n\nTo determine the initial amount, we need to work backwards from the $51 that is left. The key is to realize that the amount doubles each step back, since she spent half the previous amount.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful in calculating the doubled amounts as we work backwards. We'll need to call it multiple times, first to get the amount before buying the book, then the amount before buying the toy.\n\nThe required \"expr\" parameter can be inferred from the problem - we need to double $51 to get the previous amount, then double that result for the initial amount.\n\nSo the plan is:\n1. Call math_eval with expr \"51 * 2\" to get the amount before buying the book \n2. Take that result and plug it into another math_eval call with expr \"[result] * 2\" to get the initial amount\n</thinking>",
