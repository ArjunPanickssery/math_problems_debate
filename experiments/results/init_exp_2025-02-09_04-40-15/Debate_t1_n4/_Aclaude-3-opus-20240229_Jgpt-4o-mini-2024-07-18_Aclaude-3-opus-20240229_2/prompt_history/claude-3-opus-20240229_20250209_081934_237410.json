Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key to this problem is setting up the equation correctly based on the given information. The question states that the number of hens is 5 less than 9 times the number of roosters. \n\nIf we let x = number of roosters, then the number of hens is represented by 9x - 5.\n\nThe total number of chickens is the sum of the number of hens and roosters:\n9x - 5 + x = 75\n\nThis simplifies to:\n10x - 5 = 75\n\nAdding 5 to both sides:\n10x = 80\n\nDividing both sides by 10:\nx = 8\n\nSo there are 8 roosters. Plugging this back into the expression for the number of hens:\n9(8) - 5 = 67\n\nTherefore, answer choice (A) 67 hens is correct. The math_eval tool is not needed here since the steps can be done by hand.\n</thinking>\n\nAnswer (A) 67 hens is correct. The question states that the number of hens is 5 less than 9 times the number of roosters. If we let x represent the number of roosters, then the expression for the number of hens is 9x - 5.\n\nSince the total number of chickens is 75, we can set up the equation:\n9x - 5 + x = 75\n\nThis simplifies to 10x - 5 = 75. Adding 5 to both sides gives 10x = 80, and dividing by 10 yields x = 8 roosters. \n\nPlugging 8 back into the expression for hens, 9(8) - 5, equals 67 hens. Therefore, answer (A) is correct.",
