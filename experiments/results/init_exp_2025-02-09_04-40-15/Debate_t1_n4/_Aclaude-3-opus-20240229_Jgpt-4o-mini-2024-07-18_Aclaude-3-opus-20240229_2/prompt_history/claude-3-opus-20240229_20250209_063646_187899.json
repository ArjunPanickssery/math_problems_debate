Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

During the first leg of his journey, he drives for 4 hours straight, which means he covers a distance of 60 * 4 = 240 miles. After his 30-minute break, he resumes driving for another 9 hours at the same speed. In this second leg, he covers 60 * 9 = 540 miles. The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances covered in each leg, which is 240 + 540 = 780 miles. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 780 miles.",
