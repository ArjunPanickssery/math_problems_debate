Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The question states \"John buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students.\" This means he is buying the packs for the classes as a whole, not per student. Since there are 6 classes, and he buys 2 packs per class, the total number of packs is 6 * 2 = 12. The number of students per class is irrelevant to calculating the total packs purchased.",
