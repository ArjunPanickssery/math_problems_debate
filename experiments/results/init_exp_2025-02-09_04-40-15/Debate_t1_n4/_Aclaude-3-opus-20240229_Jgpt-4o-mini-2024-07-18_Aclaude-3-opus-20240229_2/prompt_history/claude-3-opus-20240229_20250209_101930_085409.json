Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The correct answer is A, $15,000. Here's why:\n\nThe mural is indeed 300 square feet (20 ft x 15 ft). And it does take James 6,000 minutes to paint it, since he paints at a rate of 1 square foot per 20 minutes (300 sq ft x 20 min/sq ft = 6,000 min). \n\nHowever, the key is correctly converting minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 6,000 minutes equals 100 hours (6,000 min \u00f7 60 min/hr = 100 hr).\n\nSince James charges $150 per hour, the total cost is $15,000 (100 hr x $150/hr = $15,000).\n\nThe error in answer B is that it uses the wrong conversion, directly multiplying 6,000 minutes by $150/hour. But the rate is per hour, not per minute, so this calculation is incorrect.",
