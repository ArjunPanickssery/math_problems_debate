Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question states that for every dozen flowers bought, the customer gets 2 free flowers. Maria is buying 3 dozens of flowers. \nTo calculate the total number of flowers Maria will have:\n1. Calculate the number of flowers in 3 dozens (without the free ones). This is 3 * 12 = 36 flowers.\n2. Calculate the number of free flowers Maria gets for buying 3 dozens. The question states 2 free flowers per dozen, so this would be 3 * 2 = 6 free flowers.\n3. Add the regular flowers and free flowers together to get the total. 36 + 6 = 42 total flowers.\nThe math_eval tool is not needed here as the calculations are straightforward. Answer A follows this exact logic to arrive at 42 total flowers, while Answer B makes an error by adding an extra 2 free flowers at the end, which is not stated in the question. \n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the question, Maria gets 2 free flowers for each dozen she buys. Since she is buying 3 dozens, that means she will get 3 * 2 = 6 free flowers in total, not an extra 2 free flowers on top of that. \n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- 3 dozens purchased * 12 flowers per dozen = 36 flowers purchased \n- 3 dozens purchased * 2 free flowers per dozen = 6 free flowers\n- 36 purchased + 6 free = 42 total flowers\n\nAnswer A does this calculation correctly to arrive at 42 total flowers. Answer B makes the mistake of adding an extra 2 free flowers at the end, but the question does not state any additional free flowers beyond the 2 per dozen. Therefore, Answer A of 42 total flowers is correct.",
