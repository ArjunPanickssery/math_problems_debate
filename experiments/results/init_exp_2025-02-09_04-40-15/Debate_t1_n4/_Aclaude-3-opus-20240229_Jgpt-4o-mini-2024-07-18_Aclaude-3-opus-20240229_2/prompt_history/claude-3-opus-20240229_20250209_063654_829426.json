Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Add those two costs together to get the total price\n4. Subtract the total price from the $250 Laura gave the cashier to determine the change\n\nMy assigned answer (B) follows those steps correctly:\n- It calculates 54 * 2 = $108 for the 2 pairs of pants\n- It calculates 33 * 4 = $132 for the 4 shirts\n- It adds $108 + $132 = $240 for the total\n- It subtracts $250 - $240 = $10 for the change\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to verify each of those calculations are correct. No additional information is needed.\n</thinking>",
