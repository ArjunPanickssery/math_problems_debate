Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Spiders have eight legs, two body segments, and no wings. Therefore, we should only count the ants and ladybugs when determining the number of insects remaining. There were originally 12 ants and 8 ladybugs, but 2 ladybugs flew away, leaving 6 ladybugs. So the total number of insects remaining is 12 ants + 6 ladybugs = 18 insects.",
