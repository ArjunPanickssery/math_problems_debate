Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

We can do this by dividing Mabel's marbles by 5, since Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina.\n2. Calculate how many marbles Amanda has. We know Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many as Katrina. So if we take twice Katrina's marbles and subtract 12, that will give us Amanda's current number of marbles.\n3. Subtract Amanda's marbles from Mabel's to determine how many more Mabel has.\n\nThe question provides all the information needed to perform these steps, so no additional tools are required. We can proceed with the calculation.\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the question, Mabel has 85 marbles, and she has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. Therefore, Katrina must have 85 \u00f7 5 = 17 marbles.\n\nThe question also states that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. This means that currently, Amanda has 12 fewer than twice Katrina's amount.\n\nSince Katrina has 17 marbles, twice that amount is:",
