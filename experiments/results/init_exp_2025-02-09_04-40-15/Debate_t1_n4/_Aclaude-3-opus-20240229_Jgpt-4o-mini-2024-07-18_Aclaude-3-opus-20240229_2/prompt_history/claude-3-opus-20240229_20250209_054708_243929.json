Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Find the difference between the total calories eaten and the calorie goal\n\nBoth answers agree on step 1, that the total calories eaten is 900 + 400 + 1100 = 2400.\n\nFor step 2, answer B correctly compares the 2400 total calories to the 1800 calorie goal. \nAnswer A incorrectly adds the 2400 total calories to the 1800 goal.\n\nFor step 3, answer B correctly subtracts the 1800 goal from the 2400 total to get 600 excess calories.\nAnswer A's value of 4200 does not represent the excess calories over the goal.\n</thinking>\n\nJacob ate a total of 2400 calories by having 400 calories for breakfast, 900 for lunch, and 1100 for dinner. Since his goal was to eat less than 1800 calories, the correct way to determine how many more calories he ate than planned is to subtract his 1800 calorie goal from the 2400 total calories he actually consumed:",
