Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The math confirms that Sandra got $100. The ratio 2:1:3 means Sandra gets 2 times what Amy gets. Since Amy got $50, multiplying that by Sandra's 2 parts gives us $100 for Sandra's amount.\n\nThe alternate answer suggesting to divide Amy's amount by 2 is incorrect. Division would be used if the ratio was given as 1:2:3, meaning Amy gets 1 part for every 2 parts Sandra gets. But here the ratio is 2:1:3, so multiplication is the correct operation.\n\nTherefore, going by the given 2:1:3 ratio, Sandra got 2 * $50 = $100, double the amount that Amy received. Answer (A) 100.0 is correct.",
