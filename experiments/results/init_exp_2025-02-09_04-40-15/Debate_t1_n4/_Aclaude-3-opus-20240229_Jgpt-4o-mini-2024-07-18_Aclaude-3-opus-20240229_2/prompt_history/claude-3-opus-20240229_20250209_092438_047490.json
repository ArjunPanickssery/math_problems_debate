Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

In the first year, there are 2 babies from the first time, then 2 more, for a total of 4. In the second year, there are 8 total (4 from the previous year plus 4 new ones). This doubling continues each year. By the fourth year, the total number of babies is 2 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 32. The answer cannot be 16, as that only accounts for the babies produced in the fourth year, ignoring the ones from previous years that are still present.",
