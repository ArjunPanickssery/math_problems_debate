Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Calculate the area of the shoebox base in square inches \n2. Calculate the area of the square block in square inches\n3. Subtract the block area from the shoebox area to get the uncovered area\n\nThe shoebox area can be calculated by multiplying the width and height. The block area is simply the side length squared.\n\nNo additional information is needed, as the dimensions of both the shoebox and block are provided. The math_eval tool could be used to perform the area calculations and subtraction.\n</thinking>",
