          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key to this problem is understanding the relationship between the percentage of men and women in the department. We are told that 70% of students are men, and that there are 180 women. \n\nTo find the number of men, we can leverage the fact that the percentages of men and women must add up to 100%. So if 70% are men, then the remaining 30% must be women.\n\nKnowing that 180 women represent 30% of the total, we can calculate what 1% of the total is by dividing 180 by 30. This comes out to 6 students per 1%.\n\nThen, to get the number of men, which is 70% of the total, we multiply 6 (the number of students per 1%) by 70, giving us 420 men.\n\nThe math_eval tool is not needed here, as the calculation of 180/30 and then 6*70 is straightforward. All the information needed to solve the problem is given.\n</thinking>\n\nThe number of men in the engineering department is 420. Here's why:\n\nWe know that 70% of the students are men, and that there are 180 women. The percentages of men and women must add up to 100%, so if 70% are men, the other 30% are women.\n\nThose 180 women represent 30% of the total. To find out how many students each 1% represents, we divide 180 by 30, which equals 6. \n\nSo each 1% is 6 students. Men make up 70% of the total. To get the number of men, we multiply 6 (the number per 1%) by 70, which equals 420.\n\nTherefore, there are 420 men in the engineering department.",
