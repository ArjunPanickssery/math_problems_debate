Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Calculate the number of bags delivered per day (10 bags per trip * 20 trips per day)\n2. Multiply the bags per day by the number of days (5)\n\nNo additional tools are needed, as the question provides all the necessary information and only requires basic arithmetic that I can do myself.\n</thinking>\n\nThe correct answer is 1000 bags delivered in 5 days. Here's why:\n\nJames carries 10 bags per trip, and makes 20 trips per day. So each day he delivers:",
