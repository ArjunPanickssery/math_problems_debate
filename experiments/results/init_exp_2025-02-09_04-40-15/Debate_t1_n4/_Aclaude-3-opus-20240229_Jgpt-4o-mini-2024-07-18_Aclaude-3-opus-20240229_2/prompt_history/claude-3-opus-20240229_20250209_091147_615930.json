Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Calculate how many books Peter has read using the total number of books (20) and the percentage he has read (40%)\n2. Calculate how many books Peter's brother has read using the total number of books (20) and the percentage he has read (10%) \n3. Subtract the number of books Peter's brother has read from the number of books Peter has read to get the difference\n4. Scale the difference by the total number of books to account for the fact that we are dealing with a specific collection size of 20 books\nThe math_eval tool can be used for steps 1-3 to perform the percentage and subtraction calculations. The result of step 3 then needs to be multiplied by 20 in step 4 to get the final scaled answer.\n</thinking>",
