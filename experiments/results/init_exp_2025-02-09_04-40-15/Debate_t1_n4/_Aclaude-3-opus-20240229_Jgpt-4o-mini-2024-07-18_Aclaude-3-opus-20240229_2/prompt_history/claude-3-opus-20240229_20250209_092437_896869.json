Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

To determine the number of credits she needs each semester, we divide the total credits (120) by the number of semesters (8):\n\n120 credits \u00f7 8 semesters = 15 credits per semester\n\nNow, each class is worth 3 credits. To find out how many classes she needs to take per semester, we divide the number of credits per semester (15) by the number of credits each class is worth (3):\n\n15 credits per semester \u00f7 3 credits per class = 5 classes per semester\n\nTherefore, Maddy needs to take 5 classes per semester to graduate with 120 credits in 8 semesters.",
