Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Find the length of the longer CD by doubling 1.5 hours\n2. Add the length of the two shorter 1.5 hour CDs\n3. Add the results from steps 1 and 2 together to get the total\n\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful for doing these calculations. The expr parameter can be used to specify the mathematical expressions in each step.\n</thinking>",
