If each robe costs $2, how much will the school spend?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 36.0\nThe school needs to buy 30 - 12 = 18 robes.\nSo the school will spend 18 x $2 = $36.\n#### 36\n(B): 60.0\nTo find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for all singers who need robes.\nWith 30 singers and $2 per robe, the total cost would be 30 x $2 = $60.\n#### 60</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe school already has 12 robes, so they only need to purchase robes for the remaining 18 singers. At a cost of $2 per robe, the total expense for the school will be 18 x $2 = $36. While it's true that there are 30 singers total, the question specifically asks how much the school will spend on the additional robes they need to buy. Since they already have 12 robes, they only need to buy 18 more, resulting in a total expenditure of $36.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe key point of contention between the two answers is whether the school should calculate the cost for all 30 robes, or only the 18 additional robes they need to purchase. \n\nTo determine which interpretation is correct, I'll carefully re-read the question. The most relevant part seems to be: \"Currently, the school has only 12 robes so they decided to buy the rest.\"\n\nThis suggests that the school already has 12 robes, and only needs to purchase the remaining ones to have enough for all 30 singers. So calculating the cost of all 30 robes is not the right approach.\n\nTherefore, I believe Answer A has the correct interpretation - the school should calculate the cost of the 18 additional robes they need to buy, not all 30. My argument will focus on explaining why Answer B's interpretation is incorrect based on the question details.\n</thinking>\n\nWhile Answer B calculates the total cost if the school purchased robes for all 30 singers at $2 each, this fails to account for the key detail that the school already has 12 robes. The question clearly states \"Currently, the school has only 12 robes so they decided to buy the rest.\" \n\nThis means the school only needs to purchase the remaining 18 robes to have enough for the full choir of 30 singers. Calculating the cost for all 30 robes would be paying for 12 robes the school already owns.\n\nThe correct approach, as Answer A shows, is to subtract the 12 existing robes from the total of 30 needed, to determine the school must buy 18 more. At $2 per robe, the cost is then correctly calculated as 18 * $2 = $36.\n\n</transcript>"

          "content": "Here is my argument in favor of Answer A:\n\nThe question explicitly states that the school already has 12 robes and only needs to buy the rest to outfit all 30 singers. Answer B incorrectly assumes the school must purchase robes for the entire choir. However, the school would not spend money on robes they already own.\n\nThe correct calculation is to find how many additional robes are needed by subtracting the 12 existing robes from the 30 total required. This leaves 18 robes to be purchased. At a price of $2 per robe, the school will spend precisely $36 to buy the remaining robes, as Answer A correctly determines. Anything more would be an unnecessary expense.",
