Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

To calculate the percentage off, you need to divide the amount saved by the original price, not the sale price. \n\nAsia saved $210 on the dress, since it was originally priced at $350 and she bought it on sale for $140. To get the percentage off, we calculate:\n\nAmount saved / Original price = $210 / $350 = 0.60 = 60%\n\nSo Asia got the dress for 60% off the original price. 150% would mean the dress was more expensive on sale than the original price, which doesn't make sense.",
