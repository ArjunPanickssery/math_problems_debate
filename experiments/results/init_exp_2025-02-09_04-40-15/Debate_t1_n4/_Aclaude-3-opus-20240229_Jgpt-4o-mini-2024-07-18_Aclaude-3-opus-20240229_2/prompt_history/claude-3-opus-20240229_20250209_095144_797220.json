If each robe costs $2, how much will the school spend?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 36.0\nThe school needs to buy 30 - 12 = 18 robes.\nSo the school will spend 18 x $2 = $36.\n#### 36\n(B): 60.0\nTo find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for all singers who need robes.\nWith 30 singers and $2 per robe, the total cost would be 30 x $2 = $60.\n#### 60</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe school already has 12 robes, so they only need to purchase robes for the remaining 18 singers. At a cost of $2 per robe, the total expense for the school will be 18 x $2 = $36. While it's true that there are 30 singers total, the question specifically asks how much the school will spend on the additional robes they need to buy. Since they already have 12 robes, they only need to buy 18 more, resulting in a total expenditure of $36.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe key point of contention between the two answers is whether the school should calculate the cost for all 30 robes, or only the 18 additional robes they need to purchase. \n\nTo determine which interpretation is correct, I'll carefully re-read the question. The most relevant part seems to be: \"Currently, the school has only 12 robes so they decided to buy the rest.\"\n\nThis suggests that the school already has 12 robes, and only needs to purchase the remaining ones to have enough for all 30 singers. So calculating the cost of all 30 robes is not the right approach.\n\nTherefore, I believe Answer A has the correct interpretation - the school should calculate the cost of the 18 additional robes they need to buy, not all 30. My argument will focus on explaining why Answer B's interpretation is incorrect based on the question details.\n</thinking>\n\nWhile Answer B calculates the total cost if the school purchased robes for all 30 singers at $2 each, this fails to account for the key detail that the school already has 12 robes. The question clearly states \"Currently, the school has only 12 robes so they decided to buy the rest.\" \n\nThis means the school only needs to purchase the remaining 18 robes to have enough for the full choir of 30 singers. Calculating the cost for all 30 robes would be paying for 12 robes the school already owns.\n\nThe correct approach, as Answer A shows, is to subtract the 12 existing robes from the total of 30 needed, to determine the school must buy 18 more. At $2 per robe, the cost is then correctly calculated as 18 * $2 = $36.\n\n</transcript>"

          "content": "<thinking>\nAnswer B's interpretation fails to properly account for the robes the school already owns. The question is not asking for the hypothetical cost if the school had to buy all 30 robes from scratch. \n\nInstead, it provides the key context that the school currently has 12 robes, and has made the decision to \"buy the rest.\" This phrasing makes it clear that the intent is to purchase only the additional robes needed, not re-buy ones they already have.\n\nAnswer A's approach of subtracting the 12 existing robes from the 30 total needed is the logical way to determine how many more the school needs to buy. Multiplying that difference of 18 by the $2 cost per robe yields the correct amount the school will actually spend.\n\nTo strengthen my argument, I'll emphasize that Answer B's total cost of $60 cannot possibly be correct, as it would mean the school paid for robes it already owns. I'll reiterate that the question is only asking how much they will spend on the additional robes they've decided to purchase.\n</thinking>\n\nAnswer B's calculation of the total cost for 30 robes at $60 cannot be correct, as it would imply the school is paying for 12 robes it already owns. The question states the school currently has 12 robes and has decided to \"buy the rest\" - meaning they will only purchase the additional robes needed, not the full set of 30.\n\nPaying $60 for 30 robes when 12 are already in possession would be an illogical waste of funds. No school would choose to re-buy items it has on hand. The only sensible interpretation is that the school will spend money to acquire the 18 robes it lacks to bring the total to 30.\n\nAt no point does the question suggest the school is looking to determine the cost for 30 robes in total. It solely focuses on how much they will spend to buy the remaining robes required. Answer A correctly calculates this by subtracting the 12 existing robes and multiplying the 18 additional ones needed by the $2 price, arriving at the $36 the school will actually pay.",
