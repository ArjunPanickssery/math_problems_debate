Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The question provides the following information:\n- 2 nests in 1 tree with 5 eggs each\n- 1 nest in another tree with 3 eggs \n- 1 nest in the front yard with 4 eggs\nTo calculate the total, we need to:\n1. Find the total eggs in the first tree by multiplying the number of nests (2) by eggs per nest (5)\n2. Add the eggs from the second tree's nest (3) \n3. Add the eggs from the front yard nest (4)\nThe math_eval tool can help perform this calculation by constructing an expression with the relevant numbers from the question. All the required information is provided, so no additional tools or clarification from the user is needed.\n</thinking>",
