Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe relevant tool to answer this question is math_eval. We need to calculate the percentage off that Asia got on the dress.\n\nTo calculate the percentage off, we first need to find the amount saved, which is the original price minus the sale price. We can calculate this using math_eval with the expression 350 - 140.\n\nOnce we have the amount saved, we can calculate the percentage off by dividing the amount saved by the original price. This can also be done with math_eval using the expression from the first step divided by 350.\n\nSo the plan is:\n1. Use math_eval to calculate the amount saved \n2. Use math_eval to calculate the percentage off using the amount saved\n</thinking>",
