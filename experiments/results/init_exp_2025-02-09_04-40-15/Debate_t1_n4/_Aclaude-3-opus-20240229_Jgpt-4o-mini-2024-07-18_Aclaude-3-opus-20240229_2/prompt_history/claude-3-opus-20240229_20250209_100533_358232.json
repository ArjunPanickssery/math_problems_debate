Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Find how many books Katie has (half of Darla's)\n2. Add Darla and Katie's books together \n3. Multiply that sum by 5 to get Gary's books\n4. Add Darla, Katie and Gary's books together for the total\n\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful in performing these calculations. The key steps would be:\n1. Calculate Katie's books: 6 / 2 \n2. Add Darla + Katie: 6 + (6/2)\n3. Calculate Gary's books: 5 * (6 + (6/2))\n4. Total books: 6 + (6/2) + (5 * (6 + (6/2)))\n\nAll the information needed is provided in the question. The math_eval tool should be able to handle the full calculation for the total books in one expression.\n</thinking>",
