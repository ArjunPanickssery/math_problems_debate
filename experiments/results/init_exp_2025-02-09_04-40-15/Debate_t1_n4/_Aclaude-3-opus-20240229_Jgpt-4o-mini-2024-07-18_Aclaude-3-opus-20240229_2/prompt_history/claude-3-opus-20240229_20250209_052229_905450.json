          "content": "The correct answer is 68 hens. Let me explain why:\n\nThe question states that the farm has 5 less than 9 times the number of roosters. If we let x be the number of roosters, then the number of hens is represented by 9x-5.\n\nAdding the number of hens and roosters gives us the total number of chickens: \n9x-5 + x = 75\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation:\n10x - 5 = 75\n\nAdding 5 to both sides:\n10x = 80\n\nDividing both sides by 10:\nx = 8\n\nSo there are 8 roosters. Plugging this back into the expression for the number of hens:\n9(8) - 5 = 72 - 5 = 67\n\nTherefore, the farm has 67 hens, which corresponds to answer choice (A).",
