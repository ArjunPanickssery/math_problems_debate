Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If it takes Lexie 20 minutes to run a mile, how long, in minutes, will it take Celia to 30 miles?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 300.0\nIf Lexie takes 20 minutes to run a mile, Celia takes 20/2 = 10 minutes to run the same distance since she is twice as fast.\nCelia takes 10 minutes to run one mile so it will take 10*30 = 300 minutes to run 30 miles.\n#### 300\n(A): 1200.0\nFor one mile, since Celia runs twice as fast as Lexie, she will take 20 * 2 = 40 minutes.\nTo run 30 miles, she will need 40 * 30 = 1200 minutes.\n#### 1200</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"

Since Celia is twice as fast as Lexie, and Lexie takes 20 minutes per mile, we can calculate Celia's time per mile by dividing Lexie's time by 2:\n\nCelia's time per mile = Lexie's time per mile / 2\n                      = 20 minutes / 2 \n                      = 10 minutes\n\nSo Celia runs a mile in 10 minutes. To get her time for 30 miles, we multiply her time per mile by 30:\n\nCelia's time for 30 miles = Celia's time per mile * 30\n                          = 10 minutes * 30\n                          = 300 minutes\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations.\n</thinking>",
