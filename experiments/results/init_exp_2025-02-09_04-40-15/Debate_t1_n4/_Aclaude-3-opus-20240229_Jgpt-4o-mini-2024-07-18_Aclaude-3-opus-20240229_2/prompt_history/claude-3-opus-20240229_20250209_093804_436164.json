          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding how discounts work. When an item is discounted by a certain percentage, the price you pay is the original price minus the discount amount. \n\nIn this case, Lyra paid $480 for the shoes after a 20% discount. To find the original price, we need to work backwards from the discounted price.\n\nOne approach is to realize that the $480 Lyra paid is 80% of the original price, since 100% - 20% discount = 80%. If we let x be the original price, then 0.8x = $480. Solving this equation gives x = $480 / 0.8 = $600.\n\nThe other answer takes a different approach, calculating the dollar amount of the 20% discount based on the $480 price ($96) and adding that to $480 to get $576. However, this is incorrect. The $96 would be 20% of the $480 price, not 20% of the original undiscounted price.\n\nTo illustrate why the $576 answer is wrong, let's plug it back into the problem. If the shoes originally cost $576 and there was a 20% discount, then the discounted price would be:",
