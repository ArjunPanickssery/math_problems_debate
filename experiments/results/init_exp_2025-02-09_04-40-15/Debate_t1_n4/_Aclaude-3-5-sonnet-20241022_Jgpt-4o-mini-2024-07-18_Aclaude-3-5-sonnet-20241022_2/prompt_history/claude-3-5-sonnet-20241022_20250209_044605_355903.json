Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The calculation must work backwards from Logan's hair length. Since Emily's hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's, we must subtract 6 from Logan's 20 inches to find Emily's hair length, which is 14 inches. This makes logical sense because if Emily's hair is longer than Logan's by 6 inches, then Emily's total hair length must be less than Logan's 20 inches minus the 6-inch difference. Then, since Kate's hair is half of Emily's length, we simply divide 14 by 2, giving us 7 inches for Kate's hair. The math is straightforward: 20 - 6 = 14, then 14 \u00f7 2 = 7.",
