If Garret is currently 12, how old is Shane now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 44.0\nTwenty years ago, Shane was 12 * 2 = 24 years old\nShane is currently 24 + 20 = 44 years old\n#### 44\n(A): 64.0\nFirst, we know Shane was 2 times Garret's current age of 12\nSo Shane was 12 * 2 = 24\nThen we need to account for the twenty year difference twice\nAdding 20 years for Shane and 20 years for the time difference\nSo Shane is currently 24 + 40 = 64 years old\n#### 64</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe key insight is that we need to account for the time difference twice. Let me explain why answer A (64) is correct. When we're told \"Twenty years ago, Shane was 2 times older than Garret is now,\" we're dealing with two separate time shifts. Let's calculate:\n\n1. Shane was twice Garret's current age: <tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 24,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe key insight is that we need to account for the time difference twice.

We must add 20 years twice:\n- Once to bridge the gap from \"twenty years ago\" to now\n- Once because we're comparing to Garret's current age, not his age twenty years ago<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"24 + (20 * 2)\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"24 + (20 * 2)\"},\n    \"result\": 64,\n}\n</tool_result>\n2.

Since we're comparing Shane's past age to Garret's present age, we need to account for this time shift twice, making 64 the correct answer.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe question states that twenty years ago, Shane was 2 times older than Garret is now. Since Garret is currently 12, Shane was 24 years old twenty years ago (12 \u00d7 2 = 24). To find Shane's current age, we simply need to add the 20-year time difference once, making Shane 44 years old now (24 + 20 = 44). Adding the time difference twice would be incorrect because we're only moving forward in time once. The statement \"twenty years ago\" only requires one adjustment of 20 years, not two. Think of it like a timeline - we're just moving from one point (24 years old) forward by 20 years to reach Shane's current age of 44.\n\n</transcript>"

We're simply comparing Shane's age at one point (twenty years ago) to Garret's current age, then moving forward twenty years to find Shane's current age. Adding forty years would incorrectly account for a non-existent second time shift.",
