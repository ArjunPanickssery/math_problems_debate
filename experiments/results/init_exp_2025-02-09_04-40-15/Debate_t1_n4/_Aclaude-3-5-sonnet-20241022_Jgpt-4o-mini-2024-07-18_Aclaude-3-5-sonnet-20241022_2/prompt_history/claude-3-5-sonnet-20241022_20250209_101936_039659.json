If she has 90 green houses, how many of her houses are not yellow?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 160.0\nIf the number of green houses is three times the number of yellow houses, and there are 90 green houses, then there are 90/3 = 30 yellow houses.\nShe also has 40 fewer yellow houses than blue houses, meaning there are 30+40 = 70 blue houses.\nThe number of houses that are not yellow is 70 blue houses +90 green houses = 160\n#### 160\n(A): 200.0\nIf green houses are three times yellow houses, and there are 90 green houses, then there are 90/3 = 30 yellow houses.\nYellow houses are 40 fewer than red houses, so there are 70 red houses.\nTo find all non-yellow houses, we add green houses (90) and red houses (70).\nThen we need to add the difference of 40 between red and yellow to get all non-yellow houses: 90 + 70 + 40 = 200\n#### 200</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe answer is clearly 160. Let's break this down mathematically. We know Isabella has 90 green houses, and this is three times the number of yellow houses. Therefore:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"90/3\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"90/3\"},\n    \"result\": 30.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe answer is clearly 160. Let's break this down mathematically. We know Isabella has 90 green houses, and this is three times the number of yellow houses. Therefore:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"90/3\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"90/3\"},\n    \"result\": 30.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nSo there are 30 yellow houses. Since yellow houses are 40 fewer than red houses, there must be 70 red houses. The question asks for houses that are not yellow, which means we add green houses (90) and red houses (70):<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"90+70\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"90+70\"},\n    \"result\": 160,\n}\n</tool_result>\nSo there are 30 yellow houses. Since yellow houses are 40 fewer than red houses, there must be 70 red houses. The question asks for houses that are not yellow, which means we add green houses (90) and red houses (70):<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"90+70\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"90+70\"},\n    \"result\": 160,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe opponent's solution incorrectly adds the difference of 40 at the end, which double-counts these houses as they're already included in the red house total. This leads to an inflated and incorrect answer of 200.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe question asks for houses that are not yellow, and we must be thorough in our counting. We know there are 90 green houses and 70 red houses, giving us 160 houses so far. However, the key insight is that the 40-house difference between red and yellow houses represents additional non-yellow houses that must be counted. This difference exists as separate houses in the total count, as it represents the gap between red and yellow houses. Therefore, we must add this 40 to our total of non-yellow houses (90 + 70 + 40 = 200). Excluding this would undercount the total number of non-yellow houses in Isabella's collection.\n\n</transcript>"
