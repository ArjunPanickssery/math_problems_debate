Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The calculation in answer A is mathematically sound and follows the correct logic for determining the total cost. First, we calculate the area (300 sq ft), then the total minutes (6000), convert to hours (100), and multiply by the hourly rate ($150). The key error in answer B is that it multiplies the minutes by the hourly rate, rather than converting to hours first. This creates an absurdly high price of $900,000, which would be unreasonable for a mural of this size. A cost of $15,000 is much more realistic for a professional artist spending about two and a half weeks of full-time work on a substantial mural.",
