Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The calculation must be done in the correct order to avoid mathematical errors. We start with the total credits needed (120) and divide by the number of semesters (8) to get 15 credits per semester. This is the crucial first step because we need to know how many credits to complete each semester for even distribution. Only after determining the credits per semester should we convert to number of classes. Since each class is 3 credits, 15 credits equals 15 classes per semester. This sequential approach ensures we're meeting both the total credit requirement and semester distribution requirements correctly.",
