Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

      "content": "<question>QUESTION: Isabella has three times as many green houses as yellow houses. She also has 40 fewer yellow houses than red houses. If she has 90 green houses, how many of her houses are not yellow?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 160.0\nIf the number of green houses is three times the number of yellow houses, and there are 90 green houses, then there are 90/3 = 30 yellow houses.\nShe also has 40 fewer yellow houses than blue houses, meaning there are 30+40 = 70 blue houses.\nThe number of houses that are not yellow is 70 blue houses +90 green houses = 160\n#### 160\n(A): 200.0\nIf green houses are three times yellow houses, and there are 90 green houses, then there are 90/3 = 30 yellow houses.\nYellow houses are 40 fewer than red houses, so there are 70 red houses.\nTo find all non-yellow houses, we add green houses (90) and red houses (70).\nThen we need to add the difference of 40 between red and yellow to get all non-yellow houses: 90 + 70 + 40 = 200\n#### 200</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"
