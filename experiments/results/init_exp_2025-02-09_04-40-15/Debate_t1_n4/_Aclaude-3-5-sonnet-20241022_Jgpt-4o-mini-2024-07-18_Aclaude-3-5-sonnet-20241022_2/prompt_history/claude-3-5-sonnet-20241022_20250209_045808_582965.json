Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Since the dog will be 4 years old in 2 years, that means the dog is currently 2 years old (4 - 2 = 2). Given that I was 15 when the dog was born, and the dog is now 2 years old, my current age must be 15 + 2 = 17 years old. Using the future age of the dog (4 years) in the calculation would incorrectly add extra years to my current age. The question asks for my current age, not my future age.",
