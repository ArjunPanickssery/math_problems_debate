If Garret is currently 12, how old is Shane now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 44.0\nTwenty years ago, Shane was 12 * 2 = 24 years old\nShane is currently 24 + 20 = 44 years old\n#### 44\n(A): 64.0\nFirst, we know Shane was 2 times Garret's current age of 12\nSo Shane was 12 * 2 = 24\nThen we need to account for the twenty year difference twice\nAdding 20 years for Shane and 20 years for the time difference\nSo Shane is currently 24 + 40 = 64 years old\n#### 64</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct interpretation of this problem is straightforward. Twenty years ago, Shane was twice Garret's current age. Since Garret is 12 now, Shane was 24 years old back then. Let me verify this calculation:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 24,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe correct interpretation of this problem is straightforward. Twenty years ago, Shane was twice Garret's current age. Since Garret is 12 now, Shane was 24 years old back then. Let me verify this calculation:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 24,\n}\n</tool_result>\nTo find Shane's current age, we simply add 20 years to what their age was back then:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"24 + 20\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"24 + 20\"},\n    \"result\": 44,\n}\n</tool_result>\nTo find Shane's current age, we simply add 20 years to what their age was back then:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"24 + 20\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"24 + 20\"},\n    \"result\": 44,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe answer of 64 incorrectly adds the 20-year time difference twice. This double-counting is illogical - we only need to account for the passage of time once, not separately for both Shane and the time difference. The problem already tells us Shane's age relative to Garret's current age, so we only need to add 20 years once to find Shane's present age.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe key insight is that we need to account for the time difference twice. Twenty years ago, Shane was twice Garret's current age (24 years). But since we're comparing Shane's age from twenty years ago to Garret's current age, we need to add 20 years twice: once to bridge the time gap to the present, and once more because Shane has also aged during this period. This gives us 24 + 40 = 64 years. Think of it like this: if Shane was 24 twenty years ago relative to Garret's current age of 12, then Shane must be 64 now because they've aged an additional 40 years compared to our reference point.\n\n</transcript>"
