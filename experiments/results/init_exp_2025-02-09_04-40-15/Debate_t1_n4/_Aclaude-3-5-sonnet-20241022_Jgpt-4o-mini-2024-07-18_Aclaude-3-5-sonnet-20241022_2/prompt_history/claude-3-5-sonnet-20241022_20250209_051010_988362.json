Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The answer is clearly 6 books. This is a straightforward calculation of the difference between the number of books each person has read. Peter read 40% of 20 books (8 books), while his brother read 10% of 20 books (2 books). The question asks for how many \"more\" books Peter has read, which is simply the difference between these two numbers: 8 - 2 = 6 books. There's no logical reason to multiply this difference by the total number of books, as that would give us a number larger than the entire collection, which is nonsensical in this context. The question asks for a quantity of books, and 6 represents the actual physical difference in books read.",
