Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The correct interpretation is that Katie has 2x half of Darla's books, meaning 12 books (6 \u00d7 2). This makes sense because \"half as many\" is comparing ratios - if Darla's amount is considered \"whole,\" Katie's is \"half\" of that ratio, meaning double. Let me demonstrate:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"6 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"6 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 12,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe question states Katie has \"half as many books as Darla,\" which can be interpreted in two ways.

This is a fundamental misinterpretation that invalidates the entire calculation in B. Gary's books are calculated by taking 5 times the combined books of Darla and Katie (5 \u00d7 (6 + 3) = 45). Therefore, the total number of books is 6 + 3 + 45 = 54 books. Answer A follows the precise wording of the question and provides the correct mathematical solution.\n\n</transcript>"

          "content": "The phrase \"half as many\" unambiguously means taking half of the original number, not doubling it. This is consistent with standard mathematical language and everyday usage. When we say someone has \"half as much\" of something, we mean they have 50% of the original amount. Let's break it down:\n\n1. If Katie had twice as many books as Darla, the question would have said \"twice as many,\" not \"half as many.\"\n2. Consider similar phrases: \"half as tall\" means shorter, not taller; \"half as expensive\" means cheaper, not more expensive.\n3. The opponent's interpretation defies both mathematical logic and linguistic convention.\n\nTherefore, Katie must have 3 books (half of 6), making Gary's total 5(6+3)=45 books, for a final sum of 54 books.",
