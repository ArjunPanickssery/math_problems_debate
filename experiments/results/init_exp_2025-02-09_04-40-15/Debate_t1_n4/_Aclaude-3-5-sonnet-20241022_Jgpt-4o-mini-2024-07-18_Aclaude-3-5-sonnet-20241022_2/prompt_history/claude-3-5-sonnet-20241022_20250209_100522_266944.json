How many square inches of the box are left uncovered?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 8.0\nThe shoebox is 24 square inches because 4 x 6 = 24\nThe block is 16 square inches because 4 x 4 = 16\nThere are 8 square inches uncovered because 24 - 16 = 8\n#### 8\n(B): 4\nThe shoebox perimeter is 20 (4 + 6) \u00d7 2\nThe block perimeter is 16: 4 \u00d7 4\nThe uncovered space is 20 - 16\n#### 4</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct approach is to consider the area of the box's base versus the area occupied by the square block. Let me demonstrate with calculations:\n\nFirst, the total area of the shoebox base:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4 * 6\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4 * 6\"},\n    \"result\": 24,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe correct approach is to consider the area of the box's base versus the area occupied by the square block.

Answer B incorrectly uses perimeter instead of area. When dealing with coverage of a surface, we must use area calculations. The perimeter is irrelevant because it only measures the outline length, not the actual space covered. Area is the correct measure for determining uncovered space in a box.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe question asks about uncovered space, which naturally refers to the perimeter or edges of the box's base that remain uncovered by the block. When placing a square block inside a rectangular space, what matters is the space around the edges. The perimeter calculation is the correct approach here: the shoebox has a perimeter of 20 inches (4+6+4+6), while the square block has a perimeter of 16 inches (4+4+4+4). Therefore, the uncovered space is 20 - 16 = 4 inches. The area calculation is irrelevant because we're concerned with the exposed edges, not the surface area.\n\n</transcript>"

The question specifically asks for \"square inches\" - this is a unit of area, not perimeter. If we were measuring edges, the unit would simply be \"inches.\"\n\n2. Think about placing items in a box - when we talk about uncovered space, we're talking about the empty floor space where we could potentially place more items.
