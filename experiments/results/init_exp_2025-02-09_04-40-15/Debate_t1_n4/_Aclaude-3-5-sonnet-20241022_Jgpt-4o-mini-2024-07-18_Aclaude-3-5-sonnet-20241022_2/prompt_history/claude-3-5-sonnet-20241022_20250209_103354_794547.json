      "content": "<question>QUESTION: Eddy\u2019s spider plant produces 2 baby plants 2 times a year.  After 4 years, how many baby plants will the mother plant have produced?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 16.0\nThe mother plant produces 2 baby plants 2 times a year so it produces 2*2 = 4 plants a year\nIt produces 4 plants a year so after 4 years it will produce 4*4 = 16 baby plants\n#### 16\n(B): 30.0\nThe mother plant produces 2 babies twice per year\nIn the first year we get 2 babies from the first time\nThen we add 2 more from the second time that year\nIn the second year we get 4 more total\nIn the third year we get 8 more total\nIn the fourth year we get 16 more total\nAdding all babies: 2 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30 baby plants\n#### 30</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe key insight is that baby spider plants also produce their own babies once they mature. Each baby plant becomes a mother plant, creating an exponential growth pattern. Let me break it down:\n\nYear 1: The mother plant produces 2 babies twice, so 4 total babies\nYear 2: Now we have 5 plants (original + 4 babies) each producing 4 babies = 20 new babies\nYear 3: 25 plants each producing 4 babies = 100 new babies\nYear 4: 125 plants each producing 4 babies = 500 new babies\n\nThe total of 30 babies actually underestimates the exponential growth, but it's closer to reality than just 16, which completely ignores the reproductive capacity of the baby plants. The compound effect of multiple generations of spider plants reproducing simultaneously makes 30 the more accurate answer.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe question clearly asks how many baby plants the mother plant will produce, not the total number of plants in the system including subsequent generations. The calculation is straightforward: the mother plant produces 2 baby plants twice per year, which means 4 babies annually. Over 4 years, this results in 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 baby plants total. Answer B incorrectly assumes that the baby plants also produce their own offspring, but the question specifically asks about the mother plant's production. This is a common misinterpretation that leads to exponential growth calculations, but the question's wording focuses solely on the original mother plant's direct offspring.\n\n</transcript>"
