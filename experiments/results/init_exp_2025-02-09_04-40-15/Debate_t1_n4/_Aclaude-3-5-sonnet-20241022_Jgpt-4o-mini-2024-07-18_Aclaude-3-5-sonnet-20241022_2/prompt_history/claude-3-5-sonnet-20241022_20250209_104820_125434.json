If she has $51 left, how much money, in dollars, did she have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 204.0\nAfter buying the toy, Isabel has 51*2=102 dollars left.\nIsabel had 102*2=204 dollars at first.\n#### 204\n(A): 408.0\nWorking backwards from what's left:\n51 * 2 = 102 is the previous amount\n102 * 2 = 204 is the amount before that\n204 * 2 = 408 was the initial amount\n#### 408</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe key to understanding this problem lies in carefully tracking how Isabel's money changes with each purchase. When she buys the toy, she spends half, leaving her with half. Then when she buys the book, she spends half of what remained after the toy purchase. This means she went through two halvings to reach $51. Let's work backwards:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"51 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"51 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 102,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe key to understanding this problem lies in carefully tracking how Isabel's money changes with each purchase. When she buys the toy, she spends half, leaving her with half. Then when she buys the book, she spends half of what remained after the toy purchase.

The opponent's answer of $408 incorrectly doubles the money twice, as if Isabel spent half her money twice in succession, but this isn't what happened. She spent half once for the toy, then half of what remained for the book. This is a crucial distinction that makes $204 the correct answer.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe key is understanding that \"half the remaining money\" means half of what was left after the first purchase. Let's work backwards: Isabel has $51 now. Before buying the book, she had $102 (since she spent half). Before buying the toy, she had $204 (since she spent half). But this $204 represents what was left after spending half of her initial amount on the toy. Therefore, her initial amount must have been $408. The question asks for the amount \"at first,\" so we must account for both halving operations and work backwards completely to reach the original sum.\n\n</transcript>"
