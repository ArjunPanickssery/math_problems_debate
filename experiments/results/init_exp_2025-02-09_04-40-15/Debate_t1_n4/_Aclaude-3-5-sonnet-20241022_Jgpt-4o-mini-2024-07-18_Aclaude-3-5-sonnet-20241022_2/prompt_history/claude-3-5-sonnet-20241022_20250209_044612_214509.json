Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The key is to understand that the total elevation of 1450 feet represents the absolute height John reaches, not just the change in elevation. When calculating horizontal distance using the 2:1 ratio, we must use the total elevation of 1450 feet, not the difference. This is because the ratio applies to the total vertical distance covered, regardless of starting point. Therefore, since John moves 2 feet horizontally for every 1 foot vertically, and he reaches a height of 1450 feet, the horizontal distance is 1450 \u00d7 2 = 2900 feet. The other answer incorrectly subtracts the starting elevation before applying the ratio.",
