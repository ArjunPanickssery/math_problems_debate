Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The question states Wyatt has \"4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue envelopes,\" which means we need to add 4 to the number of yellow envelopes to equal the blue ones. Therefore, if we work backwards, we start with 10 blue envelopes, and to find the number of yellow envelopes that would be 4 fewer, we add 4 to get equal amounts (10 = x + 4, where x is yellow envelopes). Solving for x gives us 14 yellow envelopes. The total is thus 10 blue + 14 yellow = 24 envelopes. This interpretation correctly follows the mathematical relationship of \"fewer than\" by working backwards from the known quantity.",
