How many cows are not black?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 4.0\nHalf of the cows: 18/2=9\nBlack cows: 5+9=14\n18-14=4 cows\n#### 4\n(B): 6\nTotal cows plus 5: 18+5 = 23\nHalf of 23 (rounded): 12\nThese are black cows\nNon-black cows: 18-12 = 6\n#### 6</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct interpretation of \"5 more than half the cows are black\" is that we need to first consider the total number of cows (18) plus 5, which gives us 23, and then take half of that number to determine the black cows. Let me demonstrate:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"18 + 5\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"18 + 5\"},\n    \"result\": 23,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe correct interpretation of \"5 more than half the cows are black\" is that we need to first consider the total number of cows (18) plus 5, which gives us 23, and then take half of that number to determine the black cows. Let me demonstrate:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"18 + 5\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"18 + 5\"},\n    \"result\": 23,\n}\n</tool_result>\nHalf of 23 is 11.5, which rounds to 12 black cows. Therefore:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"18 - 12\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"18 - 12\"},\n    \"result\": 6,\n}\n</tool_result>\nHalf of 23 is 11.5, which rounds to 12 black cows. Therefore:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"18 - 12\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"18 - 12\"},\n    \"result\": 6,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThis gives us 6 non-black cows. The phrase \"5 more than half\" logically applies to the total count including the 5, as this is how we typically express proportions in mathematics.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe question states \"5 more than half the cows are black,\" which means we need to take half of the total cows (18/2 = 9) and add 5 to get the number of black cows (14). This is a straightforward mathematical operation that directly follows the wording of the problem. Since there are 18 total cows and 14 black cows, there must be 4 non-black cows. Answer B incorrectly adds 5 to the total number of cows first, which doesn't match the problem statement. The phrase \"5 more than half\" clearly indicates we should add 5 to half of the existing cows, not create a new total.\n\n</transcript>"
