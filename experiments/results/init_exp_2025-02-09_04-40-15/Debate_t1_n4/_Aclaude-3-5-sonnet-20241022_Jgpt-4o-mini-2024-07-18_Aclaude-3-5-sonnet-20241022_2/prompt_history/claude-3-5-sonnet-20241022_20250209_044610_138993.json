Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The correct approach is to first determine Emily's hair length by adding 6 inches to Logan's 20 inches, which gives us 26 inches. This makes logical sense because the question states Emily's hair is \"longer than\" Logan's, indicating addition. Then, since Kate's hair is \"half as long\" as Emily's, we divide 26 by 2, resulting in 13 inches. The other solution incorrectly subtracts 6 from Logan's hair length, which contradicts the statement that Emily's hair is longer than Logan's. If we subtracted, Emily's hair would be shorter than Logan's, which violates the given information.",
