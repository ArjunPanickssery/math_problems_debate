Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The key difference between the two answers lies in how we calculate the total time driven. Answer A incorrectly assumes that the break time doesn't matter, simply multiplying 60 miles/hour by 13 total hours. However, Answer B correctly accounts for the full time, including the 30-minute break.\n\nWhen calculating distance traveled, we must use the actual driving time. Jace drives 4 hours initially, then takes a 30-minute (0.5-hour) break, and then drives another 9 hours. This totals 13.5 hours of actual driving time. Multiplying 60 miles/hour by 13.5 hours gives 810 miles, precisely matching Answer B.\n\nThe break doesn't reduce the total miles traveled because Jace isn't moving during that time. The calculation must use the total time he's actually in motion, which is 13.5 hours, not just 13 hours.",
