Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "I'll argue in favor of answer B (65) being the correct solution.\n\nThe problem clearly states that on Wednesday, 37 students played kickball, and on Thursday, 9 fewer students played. This means we subtract 9 from the original number, not add. So on Thursday, 37 - 9 = 28 students played kickball. To find the total number of students who played on both days, we simply add Wednesday's and Thursday's numbers: 37 + 28 = 65. This straightforward calculation follows the problem's instructions precisely. The key is understanding that \"9 fewer\" means subtraction, not addition. The total of 65 students represents the accurate count of participants across both days.",
