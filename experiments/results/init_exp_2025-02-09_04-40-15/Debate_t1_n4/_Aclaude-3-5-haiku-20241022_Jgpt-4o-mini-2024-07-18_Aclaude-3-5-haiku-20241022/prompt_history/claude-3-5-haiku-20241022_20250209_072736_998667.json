Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Each round trip involves a 3-hour drive to town and a 3-hour return trip, which totals 6 hours per trip. She makes two trips monthly, so her monthly driving time is 6 \u00d7 2 = 12 hours. ",
