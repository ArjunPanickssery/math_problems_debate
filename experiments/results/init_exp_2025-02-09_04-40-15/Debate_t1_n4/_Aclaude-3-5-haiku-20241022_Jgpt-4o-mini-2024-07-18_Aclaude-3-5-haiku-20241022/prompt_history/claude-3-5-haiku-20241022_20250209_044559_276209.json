Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "Peter has read 8 books (20 x 0.4 = 8), while his brother has read 2 books (20 x 0.1 = 2). The straightforward calculation shows that Peter has read 6 more books than his brother. The problem directly asks how many more books Peter has read, which is simply 8 - 2 = 6. The proposed alternative answer of 120 involves an unnecessary and incorrect multiplication that distorts the simple arithmetic. The question requires a direct comparison of the number of books read, not a scaling operation. The calculation is clear and direct: 6 books represent the actual difference in books read between Peter and his brother.",
