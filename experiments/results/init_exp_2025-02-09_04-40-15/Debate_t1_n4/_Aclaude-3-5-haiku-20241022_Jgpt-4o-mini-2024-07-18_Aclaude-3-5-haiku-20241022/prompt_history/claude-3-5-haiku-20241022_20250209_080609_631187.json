Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "My argument for answer B (72 hours):\n\nThe problem clearly states Melissa drives to town twice each month, taking 3 hours total per round trip. This means she spends 6 hours driving monthly (2 trips \u00d7 3 hours). Multiplying 6 hours per month by 12 months results in 72 total driving hours annually. The key is understanding the 3-hour total round trip duration, not interpreting it as a 3-hour one-way trip. The calculation is straightforward: 2 trips/month \u00d7 3 hours/trip \u00d7 12 months = 72 hours per year. This interpretation directly matches the given information and provides a precise, logical solution.",
