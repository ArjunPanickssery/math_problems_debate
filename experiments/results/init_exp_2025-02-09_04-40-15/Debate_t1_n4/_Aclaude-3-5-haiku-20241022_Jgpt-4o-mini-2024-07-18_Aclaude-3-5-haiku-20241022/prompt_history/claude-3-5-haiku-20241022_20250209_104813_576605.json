Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

So we have 12 burrs and 6 ticks, which totals 18 foreign objects. Adding the burrs gives us 30 total objects. The opponent's solution incorrectly multiplies the burrs by 6 instead of interpreting the phrase as specifying the total number of ticks.",
