Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "I'll argue in favor of answer A (420 men):\n\nThe key insight is understanding the total student population. If 180 women represent 30% of students, then the total student body can be calculated by determining what 100% looks like. By finding the proportion, we can precisely calculate the total number of students and verify the number of men.\n\n180 women = 30% of students\nIf 180 is 30%, then 1% would be 180 \u00f7 30 = 6 students\nTherefore, 100% (total students) = 6 \u00d7 100 = 600 students\nMen represent 70% of 600, which is 6 \u00d7 70 = 420 men\n\nThe mathematical logic is sound: 180 women at 30% implies 420 men at 70%, totaling 600 students. This method provides a clear, step-by-step derivation of the male student count.",
