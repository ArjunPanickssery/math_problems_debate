Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "I will argue in favor of answer B (25 blocks) using the method shown in the solution.\n\nThe key to solving this pyramid problem is understanding the block reduction pattern. Starting with 9 blocks in the first row, each subsequent row reduces by 2 blocks:\n\nFirst row: 9 blocks\nSecond row: 9 - 2 = 7 blocks\nThird row: 7 - 2 = 5 blocks\nFourth row: 5 - 2 = 3 blocks\nFifth row: 3 - 2 = 1 block\n\nWhen we sum these rows, we get: 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 25 blocks total. This matches the solution's calculation exactly. The systematic reduction of 2 blocks per row creates a consistent pattern that leads to a total of 25 blocks for the entire 5-level pyramid.\n\nThe arithmetic is straightforward and follows the problem's stated rules precisely.",
