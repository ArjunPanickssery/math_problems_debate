      "content": "QUESTION: A housewife goes to the market. She spent 2/3 of her $150. How much does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50\n(A): 100.0\nFirst calculate what fraction remains: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\nSince 2/3 was spent, multiply $150 by 2/3: $150 * (2/3) = $100\nThis is the amount she has left.\n#### 100\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe calculation clearly shows that $100 is the correct answer. When determining how much money remains, we need to calculate how much was spent, not how much is left as a fraction. Since she spent 2/3 of $150, we multiply $150 by 2/3 to get $100. This represents the amount spent, which is also the amount remaining since money follows the principle of conservation - it doesn't disappear, it just changes hands. The $100 she spent is still in her possession until the actual transaction occurs at the market. Therefore, $100 is what she has left.\n"
