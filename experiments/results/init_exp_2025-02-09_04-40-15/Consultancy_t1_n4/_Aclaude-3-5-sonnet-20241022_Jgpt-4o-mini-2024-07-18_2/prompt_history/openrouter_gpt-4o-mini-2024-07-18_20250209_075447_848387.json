      "content": "QUESTION: In the engineering department, 70% of the students are men and 180 are women. How many men are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 420.0\nThe percentage for women is 100% - 70% = 30%.\nSince 180 represents 30%, then 180/30 = 6 students represent 1%.\nHence, 6 x 70 = 420 students are men.\n#### 420\n(B): 126\nSince 70% of students are men, we can find the number by taking 70% of 180:\n180 \u00d7 0.7 = 126 men in the department.\n#### 126\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe calculation method using percentages and proportions in Answer A is mathematically sound. If 180 women represent 30% of students, then we can determine that 1% equals 6 students (180 \u00f7 30 = 6). Since men make up 70% of the department, multiplying 6 by 70 gives us 420 men. This approach is correct because it maintains the proper ratio between men and women while working with the given percentage. The alternative answer incorrectly assumes that 180 represents the total number of students, when it actually represents only the female portion (30%) of the total student population.\n"
