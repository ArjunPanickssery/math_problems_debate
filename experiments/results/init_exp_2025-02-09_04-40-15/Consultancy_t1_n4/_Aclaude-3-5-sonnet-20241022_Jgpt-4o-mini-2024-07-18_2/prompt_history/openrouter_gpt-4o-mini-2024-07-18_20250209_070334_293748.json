      "content": "QUESTION: A box of chocolate bars was shared equally between Mike, Rita and Anita. If the box contains 12 bars, how many bars did Mike and Rita get (combined)?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 8.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nMike and Rita together got 4+4 = 8 bars\n#### 8\n(A): 4.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nSince Mike and Rita shared the bars, they got 4 bars together\n#### 4\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe question specifically asks about Mike and Rita sharing the bars, indicating they received their portion together as a unit, not as separate individuals. When it states the box was shared \"equally,\" this means it was divided into three equal parts: one for Anita, and one shared portion for Mike and Rita together. Since 12 divided by 3 equals 4, Mike and Rita collectively received 4 bars to share between them. The wording \"Mike and Rita got\" implies they are being treated as a single receiving unit, not as two separate recipients.\n"
