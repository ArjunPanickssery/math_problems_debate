      "content": "QUESTION: A box of chocolate bars was shared equally between Mike, Rita and Anita. If the box contains 12 bars, how many bars did Mike and Rita get (combined)?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 8.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nMike and Rita together got 4+4 = 8 bars\n#### 8\n(A): 4.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nSince Mike and Rita shared the bars, they got 4 bars together\n#### 4\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe answer is clearly 8 bars. When we say the box was shared \"equally,\" it means each person received an equal portion of 4 bars (12 divided by 3). Since we're asked about Mike AND Rita's combined share, we must add their individual portions together: 4 bars (Mike) + 4 bars (Rita) = 8 bars total. This is basic addition of equal parts. The alternative answer of 4 bars would suggest Mike and Rita shared a single person's portion, which contradicts the initial statement that the bars were shared equally between three separate individuals.\n"
