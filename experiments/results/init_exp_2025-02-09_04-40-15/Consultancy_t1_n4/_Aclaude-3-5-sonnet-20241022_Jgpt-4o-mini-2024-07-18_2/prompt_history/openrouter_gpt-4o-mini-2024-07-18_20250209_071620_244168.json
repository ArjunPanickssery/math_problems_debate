      "content": "QUESTION: A farmer gets 20 pounds of bacon on average from a pig. He sells each pound for $6 at the monthly farmer\u2019s market. This month\u2019s pig is a runt that grew to only half the size of the average pig. How many dollars will the farmer make from the pig\u2019s bacon?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nThe pig grew to half the size of the average pig, so it will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nThe rancher will make 10 * 6 = $60 from the pig\u2019s bacon.\n#### 60\n(A): 30.0\nThe pig will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nEach pound will sell for 6 / 2 = $3.\nThe farmer will make 10 * 3 = $30 from the pig's bacon.\n#### 30\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe size of the pig only affects the amount of bacon produced, not the price per pound. While the runt pig will yield half the normal amount of bacon (10 pounds instead of 20), market economics dictate that the price per pound remains constant at $6. Customers are paying for the quality and taste of the bacon, not the size of the pig it came from. The farmer will therefore earn $6 per pound for 10 pounds of bacon, resulting in $60 total revenue. There's no logical reason why a smaller pig would require selling the bacon at half price.\n"
