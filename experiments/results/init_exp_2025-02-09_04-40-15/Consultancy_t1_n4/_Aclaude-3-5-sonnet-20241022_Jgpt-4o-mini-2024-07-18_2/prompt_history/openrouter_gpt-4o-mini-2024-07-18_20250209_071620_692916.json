      "content": "QUESTION: Twenty years ago, Shane was 2 times older than Garret is now. If Garret is currently 12, how old is Shane now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 44.0\nTwenty years ago, Shane was 12 * 2 = 24 years old\nShane is currently 24 + 20 = 44 years old\n#### 44\n(A): 64.0\nFirst, we know Shane was 2 times Garret's current age of 12\nSo Shane was 12 * 2 = 24\nThen we need to account for the twenty year difference twice\nAdding 20 years for Shane and 20 years for the time difference\nSo Shane is currently 24 + 40 = 64 years old\n#### 64\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe solution is straightforward when we carefully follow the timeline. Twenty years ago, Shane's age was twice Garret's current age of 12, meaning Shane was 24 years old at that point. To find Shane's current age, we simply need to add the 20-year time difference once, bringing us to 44 years old. Adding the time difference twice would be incorrect because we're only moving forward in time once. The problem states \"Twenty years ago, Shane was 2 times older than Garret is now\" - this gives us one fixed point in time (24 years), and we only need to add 20 years once to reach the present.\n"
