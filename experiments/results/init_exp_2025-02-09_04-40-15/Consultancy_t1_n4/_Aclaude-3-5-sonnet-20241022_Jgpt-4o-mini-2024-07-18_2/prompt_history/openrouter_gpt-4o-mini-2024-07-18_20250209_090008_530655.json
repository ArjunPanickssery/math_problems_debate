      "content": "QUESTION: A housewife goes to the market. She spent 2/3 of her $150. How much does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50\n(A): 100.0\nFirst calculate what fraction remains: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\nSince 2/3 was spent, multiply $150 by 2/3: $150 * (2/3) = $100\nThis is the amount she has left.\n#### 100\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe calculation clearly shows that if the housewife spent 2/3 of her money, she must have 1/3 remaining. Basic fraction arithmetic tells us that 3/3 (the whole amount) minus 2/3 (what she spent) equals 1/3 (what's left). To find the dollar amount, we simply multiply the original amount ($150) by the remaining fraction (1/3). This gives us $150 * (1/3) = $50. This is a straightforward application of fractions and multiplication. Answer A incorrectly multiplies by 2/3 (the spent portion) instead of 1/3 (the remaining portion), which leads to the wrong result.\n"
