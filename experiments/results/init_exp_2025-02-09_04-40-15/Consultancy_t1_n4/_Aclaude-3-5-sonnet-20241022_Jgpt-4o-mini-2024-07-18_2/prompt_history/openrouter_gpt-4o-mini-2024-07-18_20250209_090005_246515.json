      "content": "QUESTION: Brianne saves $10 in January. Each month, she saves twice as much as her previous month's savings. How much will she save in May?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 160.0\nBrianne saves $10 x 2 = $20 in February.\nShe will save $20 x 2 = $40 in March.\nShe will save $40 x 2 = $80 in April.\nTherefore, she will save $80 x 2 = $160 in May.\n#### 160\n(A): 810.0\nStarting with $10 in January\nFor February: $10 becomes $30\nFor March: $30 becomes $90\nFor April: $90 becomes $270\nFor May: $270 becomes $810\n#### 810\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe calculation showing $160 as the answer correctly follows the problem's instructions of doubling the savings each month. Starting with $10 in January, we multiply by 2 each month: February ($20), March ($40), April ($80), and finally May ($160). This follows the precise mathematical pattern of exponential growth with a factor of 2. The other answer incorrectly adds the previous amount instead of just doubling it, which wasn't specified in the question. The pattern of doubling is clear and straightforward: 10\u219220\u219240\u219280\u2192160, representing a pure geometric sequence with ratio 2.\n"
