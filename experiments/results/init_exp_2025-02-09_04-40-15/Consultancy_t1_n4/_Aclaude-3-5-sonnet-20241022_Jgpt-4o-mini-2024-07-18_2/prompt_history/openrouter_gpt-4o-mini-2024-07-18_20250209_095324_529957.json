      "content": "QUESTION: Sam shared a sum of money between his three cousins Sandra, Amy and Ruth in the ratio 2:1:3 respectively. If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100\n(B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe ratio 2:1:3 means that Sandra gets 2 parts for every 1 part Amy receives. Since Amy received $50, this represents one part of the ratio. To find Sandra's share, we must multiply Amy's amount by 2, as Sandra gets twice as many parts. Therefore, Sandra received $100. This is consistent with how ratios work in sharing problems - if one part equals $50, then two parts must equal $100. This also maintains the proportional relationship between all cousins, as Ruth's three parts would equal $150, making the total distribution $300, which perfectly reflects the original 2:1:3 ratio.\n"
