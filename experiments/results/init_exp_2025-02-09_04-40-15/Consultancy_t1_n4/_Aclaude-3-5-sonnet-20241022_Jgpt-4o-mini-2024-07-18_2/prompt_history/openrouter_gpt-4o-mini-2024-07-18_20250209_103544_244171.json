      "content": "QUESTION: Maria bought a ticket to a ZOO. The regular price stands at $15, but she was able to get a 40% discount. How much did Maria pay for the ticket?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 9.0\nThe discount Maria got was 40/100 * 15 = $6.\nThat means the price for her ticket was 15 - 6 = $9.\n#### 9\n(B): 6.0\nA 40% discount means the price is 40/100 of the original amount.\n40/100 * 15 = $6\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of B\nA 40% discount means you pay 40% of the original price, not subtract 40%. This is a common mathematical convention - when we say something is \"40% off\" or has a \"40% discount,\" we mean you pay that percentage of the original price. Just like when a store advertises \"40% off,\" they mean you pay 40% of the listed price. Therefore, Maria would pay 40% of $15, which is $6. The calculation in answer A incorrectly subtracts the discount amount instead of directly calculating the discounted price.\n"
