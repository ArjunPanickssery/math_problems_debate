      "content": "QUESTION: Bush and Matt are brothers. Bush is younger than Matt by 3 years. This year Bush will be 12 years old. What will be Matt's age 10 years from now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 25.0\nBush is younger than Matt by 3 years, so if Bush is 12 years old then Matt is 12+3 = 15 years old\nIn 10 years' time, Matt will be 10+15 = 25 years old\n#### 25\n(B): 28.0\nBush is 12, Matt is 3 years older, so Matt is 12+3 = 15\nSince Matt will always be 3 years older, we add 3 again: 15+3 = 18\nIn 10 years' time, Matt will be 18+10 = 28\n#### 28\n## Argument in favour of A\nBush is currently 12 years old, and Matt is 3 years older, which means Matt is 15 years old right now. To find Matt's age 10 years from now, we simply add 10 to his current age: 15 + 10 = 25. This straightforward calculation follows directly from the given information. The problem provides clear, sequential steps: first establishing Bush's current age, then Matt's current age, and finally projecting Matt's future age by adding the specified 10 years. The math is simple and direct, leading to the answer of 25 years old.\n"
