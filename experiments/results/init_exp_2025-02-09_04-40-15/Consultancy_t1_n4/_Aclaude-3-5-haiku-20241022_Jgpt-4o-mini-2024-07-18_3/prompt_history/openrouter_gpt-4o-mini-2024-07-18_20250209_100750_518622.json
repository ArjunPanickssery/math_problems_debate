      "content": "QUESTION: John buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students.  He has 6 classes and 30 students in each class.  How many packs did he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 360.0\nJohn has 6*30=180 students\nSo he bought 180*2=360 packs\n#### 360\n(A): 12.0\nCalculate number of classes: 6\nMultiply by 2 packs per class: 6*2=12\n#### 12\n## Argument in favour of A\nJohn needs 2 packs of index cards per class, not per student. The problem states he has 6 classes, so the correct calculation is simply 6 classes * 2 packs per class = 12 packs total. The other solution erroneously multiplies by the total number of students, which is unnecessary and leads to an inflated number. The goal is to supply index cards at the class level, not individually, so the total number of packs is determined by the number of classes multiplied by the packs per class.\n"
