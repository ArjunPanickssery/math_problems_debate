      "content": "QUESTION: 4.5 gallons of coffee were divided among 18 thermoses. Genevieve drank 3 thermoses. How many pints of coffee did Genevieve drink?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 6.0\n4.5 gallons = 4.5 * 8 pints = 36 pints\n36/18 = 2 pints\nGenevieve drank 2*3=6 pints of coffee.\n#### 6\n(A): 3.0\n4.5 gallons = 4.5 * 4 pints = 18 pints\n18/18 = 1 pint per thermos\nGenevieve drank 1*3 = 3 pints of coffee.\n#### 3\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe key to solving this problem lies in understanding the conversion between gallons and pints. Answer A correctly calculates that 4.5 gallons converts to 18 pints when using the standard conversion of 4 pints per gallon. By dividing the total 18 pints equally among 18 thermoses, each thermos contains 1 pint. Since Genevieve drank 3 thermoses, she consumed 3 pints of coffee. The calculation is straightforward and mathematically sound. Answer B incorrectly uses 8 pints per gallon, leading to an inflated result. The simplicity and accuracy of Answer A make it the most reliable solution to this problem.\n"
