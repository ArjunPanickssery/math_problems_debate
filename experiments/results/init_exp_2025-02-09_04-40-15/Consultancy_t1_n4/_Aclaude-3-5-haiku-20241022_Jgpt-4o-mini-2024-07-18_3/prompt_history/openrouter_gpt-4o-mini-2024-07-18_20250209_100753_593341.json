      "content": "QUESTION: Jack buys a squat rack for $2500.  The barbell cost 1/10 as much.  How much did he pay for everything?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2750.0\nThe barbell cost 2500/10=$250\nSo he paid 2500+250=$2750 for everything\n#### 2750\n(B): 2250\nThe squat rack costs $2500\nFor the barbell at 1/10 the price: 2500/10 = 250\nApplying this difference to the total: 2500 - 250 = 2250\n#### 2250\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is B: $2250. The problem clearly states that Jack bought a squat rack for $2500, and the barbell costs 1/10 as much. Calculating the barbell's price: $2500 \u00f7 10 = $250. However, the key is understanding the phrase \"1/10 as much\" - this means the barbell's price is subtracted from the total, not added. So the total cost is $2500 - $250 = $2250. The calculation in option A erroneously adds the barbell cost, which contradicts the original problem statement of the barbell being \"1/10 as much\". The mathematical logic in option B precisely follows the problem's description, making $2250 the correct total cost.\n"
