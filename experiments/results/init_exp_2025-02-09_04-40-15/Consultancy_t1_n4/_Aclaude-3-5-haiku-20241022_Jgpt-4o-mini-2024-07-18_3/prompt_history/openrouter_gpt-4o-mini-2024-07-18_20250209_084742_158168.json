      "content": "QUESTION: A box of chocolate bars was shared equally between Mike, Rita and Anita. If the box contains 12 bars, how many bars did Mike and Rita get (combined)?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 8.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nMike and Rita together got 4+4 = 8 bars\n#### 8\n(A): 4.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nSince Mike and Rita shared the bars, they got 4 bars together\n#### 4\n## Argument in favour of B\nMike and Rita each receive an equal share of the 12 chocolate bars when divided among three people. Since 12 divided by 3 is 4, each person gets 4 bars. When we combine Mike and Rita's shares, they together receive 8 bars (4 + 4 = 8). This straightforward arithmetic clearly demonstrates that the total number of bars Mike and Rita get is 8. The problem is simple division and addition, and the calculation shows that 8 bars is the correct answer for their combined share.\n"
