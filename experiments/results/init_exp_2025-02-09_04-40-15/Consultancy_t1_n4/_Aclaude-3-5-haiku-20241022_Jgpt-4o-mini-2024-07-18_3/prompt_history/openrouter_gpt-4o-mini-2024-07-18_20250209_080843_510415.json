      "content": "QUESTION: Jace drives 60 miles per hour. If Jace drives for 4 hours straight, take a 30-minute break, and then drives for another 9 hours straight, how many miles will he travel?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 780.0\nJace drives a total of 4+9 = 13 hours.\nJace will travel 60*13 = 780 miles.\n#### 780\n(B): 810.0\nThe total time is 4 hours for the first segment, 0.5 hours for the break period, and 9 hours for the second segment, summing to 13.5 hours.\nAt 60 miles per hour for 13.5 hours, the total distance traveled is 60 * 13.5 = 810 miles.\n#### 810\n## Argument in favour of A\nJace's total driving time is 13 hours, during which he maintains a consistent speed of 60 miles per hour. The key calculation is simply multiplying his speed by total driving time: 60 miles/hour \u00d7 13 hours = 780 miles. The 30-minute break does not factor into distance calculation because he is not moving during that time. The problem asks about miles traveled, which only occurs when the vehicle is in motion. Therefore, the correct answer is 780 miles, as the break period is not included in the distance computation. The straightforward multiplication of speed and driving time yields the precise distance traveled.\n"
