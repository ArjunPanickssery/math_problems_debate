      "content": "QUESTION: Winwin won $50 in a lottery. She paid 20% for the tax and she paid $5 for the processing fee. How much was she able to take home?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 35.0\nWinwin paid $50 x 20/100 = $10 for the tax.\nSo, she has $50 - $10 = 40 after paying the tax.\nTherefore, Winwin was able to take home $40 - $5 = $35 after she paid for the processing fee.\n#### 35\n(B): 36.0\nFirst subtract the processing fee: $50 - $5 = $45\nThen calculate 20% tax of $45: $45 x 20/100 = $9\nTherefore, Winwin was able to take home $45 - $9 = $36\n#### 36\n## Argument in favour of B\nWinwin's take-home amount should be $36, and here's why: The key is the order of operations. By first subtracting the processing fee, we create a lower base amount on which to calculate the tax. This means the tax will be a smaller dollar amount compared to calculating it on the full $50. \n\nLet's break it down step-by-step:\n1. Start with $50 lottery winnings\n2. Subtract $5 processing fee first, leaving $45\n3. Calculate 20% tax on $45, which is $9\n4. Subtract $9 tax from $45\n5. Final take-home amount is $36\n\nThis approach minimizes the tax burden and maximizes Winwin's actual earnings. The order of operations matters significantly in financial calculations.\n"
