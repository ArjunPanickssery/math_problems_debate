      "content": "QUESTION: John buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students.  He has 6 classes and 30 students in each class.  How many packs did he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 360.0\nJohn has 6*30=180 students\nSo he bought 180*2=360 packs\n#### 360\n(A): 12.0\nCalculate number of classes: 6\nMultiply by 2 packs per class: 6*2=12\n#### 12\n## Argument in favour of B\nJohn needs 2 packs of index cards for each student, and he has 6 classes with 30 students per class. To calculate the total number of packs, we first determine the total number of students: 6 classes \u00d7 30 students per class = 180 students. Then, we multiply the total number of students by the number of packs per student: 180 students \u00d7 2 packs per student = 360 packs. This ensures every single student receives their required 2 packs of index cards. The calculation is straightforward and accounts for the full student population across all of John's classes.\n"
