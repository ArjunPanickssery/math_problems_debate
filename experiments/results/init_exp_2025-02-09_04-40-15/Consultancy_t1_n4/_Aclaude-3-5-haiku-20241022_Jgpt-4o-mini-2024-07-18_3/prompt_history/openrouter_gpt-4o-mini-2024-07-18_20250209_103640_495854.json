      "content": "QUESTION: A housewife goes to the market. She spent 2/3 of her $150. How much does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50\n(A): 100.0\nFirst calculate what fraction remains: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\nSince 2/3 was spent, multiply $150 by 2/3: $150 * (2/3) = $100\nThis is the amount she has left.\n#### 100\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is B: $50. When the housewife spends 2/3 of her $150, she logically has 1/3 remaining. This can be calculated by subtracting the spent fraction from the total: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3. Multiplying the remaining fraction by the total amount gives us $150 * (1/3) = $50. The mathematical logic is straightforward: if she spent 2/3 of her money, the remaining amount must be 1/3, which directly translates to $50. The step-by-step calculation clearly demonstrates that $50 is the amount left in her possession after shopping.\n"
