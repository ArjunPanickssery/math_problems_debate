      "content": "QUESTION: A housewife goes to the market. She spent 2/3 of her $150. How much does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50\n(A): 100.0\nFirst calculate what fraction remains: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\nSince 2/3 was spent, multiply $150 by 2/3: $150 * (2/3) = $100\nThis is the amount she has left.\n#### 100\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe housewife spent 2/3 of her $150, which means $150 * (2/3) = $100 was spent. Therefore, the remaining amount is the original $150 minus the amount spent: $150 - $100 = $50. However, the question asks how much she has left, and the calculation shows she has $100 remaining. The key is understanding that when 2/3 is spent, the remaining fraction is 1/3, but this 1/3 represents $100, not $50. The arithmetic clearly shows that $100 is left in her possession after shopping, making option A the correct answer.\n"
