      "content": "QUESTION: Isaac cut his 30 meters ribbon into 6 equal parts. He then used 4 parts of the ribbon. How many meters of ribbon are not used?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 10.0\nEach part is 30/6 = 5 meters long.\nSince Liam used 4 parts, then he used 5 x 4 = 20 meters of the ribbon.\nSo, 30 - 20 = 10 meters of ribbon is not used.\n#### 10\n(B): 15.0\nThe ribbon was cut into 6 parts, and 4 were used, leaving 2 parts unused.\nEach part is 30/4 = 7.5 meters long.\nTherefore 2 \u00d7 7.5 = 15 meters were not used.\n#### 15\n## Argument in favour of A\nIsaac cut his 30-meter ribbon into 6 equal parts, which means each part is 5 meters long (30 \u00f7 6 = 5). He used 4 parts of the ribbon, which means he used 4 \u00d7 5 = 20 meters. Therefore, the total ribbon not used is 30 - 20 = 10 meters. This calculation is straightforward and follows the problem's given information precisely. The key steps are dividing the total length by the number of parts to find the length of each part, then multiplying the used parts, and subtracting from the total ribbon length. Option A provides the correct solution with clear, logical reasoning.\n"
