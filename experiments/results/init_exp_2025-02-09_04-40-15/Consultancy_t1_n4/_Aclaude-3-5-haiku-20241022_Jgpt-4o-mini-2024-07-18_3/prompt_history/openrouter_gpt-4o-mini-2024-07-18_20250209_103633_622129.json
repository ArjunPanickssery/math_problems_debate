      "content": "QUESTION: Brianne saves $10 in January. Each month, she saves twice as much as her previous month's savings. How much will she save in May?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 160.0\nBrianne saves $10 x 2 = $20 in February.\nShe will save $20 x 2 = $40 in March.\nShe will save $40 x 2 = $80 in April.\nTherefore, she will save $80 x 2 = $160 in May.\n#### 160\n(A): 810.0\nStarting with $10 in January\nFor February: $10 becomes $30\nFor March: $30 becomes $90\nFor April: $90 becomes $270\nFor May: $270 becomes $810\n#### 810\n## Argument in favour of B\nBrianne's savings follow a clear exponential growth pattern. In January, she starts with $10. Each subsequent month, she doubles her previous month's savings. By carefully tracking this progression:\n\nJanuary: $10\nFebruary: $10 x 2 = $20\nMarch: $20 x 2 = $40\nApril: $40 x 2 = $80\nMay: $80 x 2 = $160\n\nThe mathematical logic is straightforward - each month's savings is exactly double the previous month's amount. This consistent doubling leads precisely to $160 in May. The calculation is systematic and leaves no room for alternative interpretations. The step-by-step progression clearly demonstrates how Brianne's savings grow exponentially, culminating in $160 by May.\n"
