      "content": "QUESTION: John eats a bag of chips for dinner and then eats twice as many after dinner.  How many bags of chips did he eat?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 3.0\nHe ate 2 * 1 = 2 bags after dinner\nSo he ate 2 + 1 = 3 bags of chips\n#### 3\n(A): 2.0\nHe ate 1 bag for dinner\nApply the doubling: 1 * 2 = 2 bags in total\n#### 2\n## Argument in favour of A\nJohn eats 1 bag of chips for dinner, which is the baseline amount. The problem states he then eats \"twice as many\" after dinner. This means he multiplies his initial amount by 2, resulting in 2 bags total. The key phrase \"twice as many\" indicates multiplication, not addition. By doubling the initial 1 bag, we arrive precisely at 2 bags of chips consumed. The mathematical logic is straightforward: 1 * 2 = 2, making answer A the correct interpretation of the problem's scenario.\n"
