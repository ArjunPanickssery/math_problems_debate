      "content": "QUESTION: John starts climbing a very steep hill.  He travels 1 foot vertically for every two feet horizontally.  His elevation increases from 100 feet to 1450 feet.  How far does he move horizontally, in feet?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2700.0\nHe travels 1450-100=1350 feet vertically\nSo he travels 1350*2=2700 feet horizontally\n#### 2700\n(B): 2900.0\nHe reaches an elevation of 1450 feet\nSince he moves 2 feet horizontally for each vertical foot, he travels 1450*2=2900 feet horizontally\n#### 2900\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct answer is (A): 2700.0. John's elevation increases from 100 feet to 1450 feet, which means he climbs 1350 feet vertically. Given that he travels 2 feet horizontally for every 1 foot vertically, the horizontal distance he covers is 1350 * 2 = 2700 feet. Answer (B) incorrectly calculates the horizontal distance based on the final elevation (1450 feet) rather than the change in elevation, leading to an overestimation. The key is to focus on the difference in elevation, not the final elevation, to determine the correct horizontal distance traveled.\n"
