      "content": "QUESTION: Sam has 18 cows.  5 more than half the cows are black.  How many cows are not black?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 4.0\nHalf of the cows: 18/2=9\nBlack cows: 5+9=14\n18-14=4 cows\n#### 4\n(B): 6\nTotal cows plus 5: 18+5 = 23\nHalf of 23 (rounded): 12\nThese are black cows\nNon-black cows: 18-12 = 6\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct answer is (A): 4.0. The question states that 5 more than half the cows are black. Half of 18 cows is 9. Adding 5 to this gives 14 black cows. Subtracting 14 from the total 18 cows leaves 4 cows that are not black. This interpretation directly follows the wording of the question and provides a clear, logical solution. Answer (B) incorrectly adds 5 to the total number of cows before calculating half, which misinterprets the problem's instructions. Therefore, the correct number of non-black cows is 4.\n"
