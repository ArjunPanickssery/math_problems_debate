      "content": "QUESTION: John eats a bag of chips for dinner and then eats twice as many after dinner.  How many bags of chips did he eat?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 3.0\nHe ate 2 * 1 = 2 bags after dinner\nSo he ate 2 + 1 = 3 bags of chips\n#### 3\n(A): 2.0\nHe ate 1 bag for dinner\nApply the doubling: 1 * 2 = 2 bags in total\n#### 2\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is **B: 3.0**. John ate 1 bag of chips for dinner. After dinner, he ate twice as many, which is 2 bags (2 * 1). Adding the initial bag to the 2 bags he ate after dinner gives a total of 3 bags. The phrasing \"twice as many after dinner\" clearly indicates that the doubling applies to the post-dinner consumption, not the total. Therefore, the total number of bags consumed is 3, not 2.\n"
