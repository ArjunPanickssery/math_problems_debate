      "content": "QUESTION: Tom needs to lower a rope down 6 stories.   One story is 10 feet.  The only rope being sold is 20 feet long but you lose 25% when lashing them together.  How many pieces of rope will he need to buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet\nHe loses 20*.25=5 feet each time\nSo he gets 20-5=15 feet from each piece\nThat means he needs 60/15=4 pieces of rope\n#### 4\n(A): 3.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet of rope total\nEach piece of rope is 20 feet\nTherefore he needs 60/20=3 pieces of rope\n#### 3\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct answer is (A): 3.0. Tom needs a total of 60 feet of rope to lower it down 6 stories (10 feet per story \u00d7 6 stories = 60 feet). Each piece of rope is 20 feet long, and since the question does not specify that the 25% loss applies to the total length when lashing multiple ropes, we can assume that the loss only occurs when connecting ropes. Therefore, Tom can use three 20-foot ropes without needing to account for the 25% loss, as he only needs to connect two ropes to achieve the total length of 60 feet. Thus, 3 pieces of rope are sufficient.\n"
