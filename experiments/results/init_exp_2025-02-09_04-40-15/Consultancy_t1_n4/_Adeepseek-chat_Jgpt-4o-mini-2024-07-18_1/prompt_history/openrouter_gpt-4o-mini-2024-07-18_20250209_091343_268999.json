      "content": "QUESTION: There are 14 red crayons, 5 more blue crayons than red crayons, and 6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons.  How many yellow crayons are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 32.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:5+14=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)-6=32 crayons\n#### 32\n(A): 44.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:14+5=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)+6=44 crayons\n#### 44\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is (B): 32.0. The problem states there are 14 red crayons, and 5 more blue crayons than red crayons, so blue crayons = 14 + 5 = 19. It also specifies that the number of yellow crayons is 6 less than double the blue crayons, which means yellow crayons = 19 * 2 - 6 = 32. The calculation is straightforward and aligns perfectly with the given conditions. Answer (A) incorrectly adds 6 instead of subtracting, leading to an incorrect total of 44. Therefore, the correct number of yellow crayons is 32.\n"
