      "content": "QUESTION: In a bookstore, a book costs $5. When Sheryll bought 10 books, she was given a discount of $0.5 each. How much did Sheryll pay in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 45.0\nInstead of $5 each, a book costs $5 - $0.5 = $4.5 each.\nSheryll paid $4.5/book x 10 books = $45.\n#### 45\n(B): 55.0\nThe regular price is $5 per book.\nThe $0.5 discount is added to each book's price: $5 + $0.5 = $5.5 per book.\nTotal cost is $5.5 \u00d7 10 = $55.\n#### 55\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct answer is (A): $45.0. The question states that Sheryll was given a discount of $0.5 on each book. A discount reduces the price, so the cost per book becomes $5 - $0.5 = $4.5. Multiplying this by the 10 books she bought, Sheryll paid $4.5 x 10 = $45. Answer (B) incorrectly interprets the discount as an increase in price, which contradicts the definition of a discount. Therefore, (A) is the accurate calculation based on the information provided.\n"
