      "content": "QUESTION: John buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students.  He has 6 classes and 30 students in each class.  How many packs did he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 360.0\nJohn has 6*30=180 students\nSo he bought 180*2=360 packs\n#### 360\n(A): 12.0\nCalculate number of classes: 6\nMultiply by 2 packs per class: 6*2=12\n#### 12\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct answer is (A): 12.0. John has 6 classes, and he buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students in each class. The number of students per class is irrelevant because the question specifies that he buys 2 packs per class, not per student. Therefore, the calculation is straightforward: 6 classes * 2 packs per class = 12 packs. The answer (B) incorrectly multiplies by the number of students, which is not required based on the question's wording. The key detail is that the packs are bought for each class, not for each individual student.\n"
