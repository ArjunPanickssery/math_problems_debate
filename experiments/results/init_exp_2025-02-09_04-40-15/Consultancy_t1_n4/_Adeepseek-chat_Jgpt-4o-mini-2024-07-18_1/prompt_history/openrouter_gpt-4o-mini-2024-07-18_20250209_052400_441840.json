      "content": "QUESTION: Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's hair. Emily\u2019s hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's hair. If Logan hair is 20 inches, how many inches is Kate\u2019s hair?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 7.0\nEmily\u2019s hair is 20-6 = 14 inches long.\nKate's hair 14/2= 7 inches long.\n#### 7\n(A): 13\nEmily's hair is 20+6 = 26 inches long.\nKate's hair is 26/2 = 13 inches long.\n#### 13\n## Argument in favour of B\nEmily\u2019s hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's hair, and Logan's hair is 20 inches. Therefore, Emily\u2019s hair is 20 - 6 = 14 inches long. Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's, so Kate's hair is 14 / 2 = 7 inches. The calculation is straightforward and follows the given relationships directly. The answer is clearly 7 inches, as supported by the arithmetic.\n"
