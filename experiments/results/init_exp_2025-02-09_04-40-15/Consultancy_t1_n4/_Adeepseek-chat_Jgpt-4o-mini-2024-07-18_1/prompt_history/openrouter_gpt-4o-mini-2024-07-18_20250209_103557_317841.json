      "content": "QUESTION: Maria bought a ticket to a ZOO. The regular price stands at $15, but she was able to get a 40% discount. How much did Maria pay for the ticket?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 9.0\nThe discount Maria got was 40/100 * 15 = $6.\nThat means the price for her ticket was 15 - 6 = $9.\n#### 9\n(B): 6.0\nA 40% discount means the price is 40/100 of the original amount.\n40/100 * 15 = $6\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct answer is (A): 9.0. A 40% discount on a $15 ticket means Maria saves 40% of $15, which is $6. Therefore, she pays the original price minus the discount: $15 - $6 = $9. Answer (B) incorrectly assumes that the 40% discount is the final price, but discounts are subtracted from the original price, not used as the final amount. Thus, Maria paid $9 for the ticket.\n"
