      "content": "QUESTION: June found 2 birds nest with 5 eggs each in 1 tree and 1 nest with 3 eggs in another tree.  There was also a nest with 4 eggs in her front yard.  How many birds eggs did she find?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 17.0\nThere are 2 nests with 5 eggs each so 2*5 = 10 eggs\nWhen you add up all the eggs she has found she has 10+3+4 = 17 eggs\n#### 17\n(A): 14.0\nFor the first tree with 2 nests: 2+5 = 7 eggs\nThe second tree has 3 eggs\nThe front yard nest has 4 eggs\nTotal eggs found: 7+3+4 = 14\n#### 14\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is (B): 17.0. June found 2 nests in one tree, each containing 5 eggs, which totals 10 eggs (2 * 5 = 10). In another tree, she found 1 nest with 3 eggs. Additionally, there was a nest with 4 eggs in her front yard. Adding these together, 10 + 3 + 4 = 17 eggs. Answer (A) incorrectly calculates the first tree as 2 + 5 = 7 eggs, which misinterprets the problem. The question clearly states that there are 2 nests with 5 eggs each, not 2 nests totaling 5 eggs. Therefore, the correct total is 17 eggs.\n"
