      "content": "QUESTION: Winwin won $50 in a lottery. She paid 20% for the tax and she paid $5 for the processing fee. How much was she able to take home?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 35.0\nWinwin paid $50 x 20/100 = $10 for the tax.\nSo, she has $50 - $10 = 40 after paying the tax.\nTherefore, Winwin was able to take home $40 - $5 = $35 after she paid for the processing fee.\n#### 35\n(B): 36.0\nFirst subtract the processing fee: $50 - $5 = $45\nThen calculate 20% tax of $45: $45 x 20/100 = $9\nTherefore, Winwin was able to take home $45 - $9 = $36\n#### 36\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is (B): 36.0. The question specifies that Winwin paid a 20% tax and a $5 processing fee. The tax should be calculated on the remaining amount after the processing fee is deducted, not on the original $50. Therefore, the correct calculation is: $50 - $5 = $45, then $45 x 20/100 = $9, and finally $45 - $9 = $36. This ensures the tax is applied to the correct base amount, resulting in Winwin taking home $36.\n"
