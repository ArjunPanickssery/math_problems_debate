      "content": "QUESTION: If Stu has 9 books and Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu, how many books do Stu and Albert have in total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 45.0\nAlbert has 4 * 9 books belonging to Stu = 36 books.\nSo the pair have a combined total of 36 books belonging to Albert + 9 books belonging to Stu = 45 books.\n#### 45\n(B): 22.0\nFirst we determine Albert's books by taking Stu's 9 books and adding 4 for each book of Stu's = 13 books.\nThen we add both collections together: 13 + 9 = 22 books total.\n#### 22\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct answer is (A): 45.0. The question states that Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu. Stu has 9 books, so Albert has 4 * 9 = 36 books. To find the total number of books, we add Stu's books to Albert's books: 9 + 36 = 45. Answer (B) is incorrect because it misinterprets \"4 times as many\" as adding 4 books for each of Stu's books, which is not the correct mathematical operation. The phrase \"4 times as many\" clearly indicates multiplication, not addition. Therefore, the total number of books is 45.\n"
