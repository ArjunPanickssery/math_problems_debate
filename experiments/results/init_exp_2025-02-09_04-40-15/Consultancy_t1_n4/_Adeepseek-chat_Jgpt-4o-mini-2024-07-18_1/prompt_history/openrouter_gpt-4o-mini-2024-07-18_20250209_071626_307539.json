      "content": "QUESTION: James buys twice as many toy soldiers as toy cars.  He buys 20 toy cars.  How many total toys does he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nHe buys 2*20=40 toy cars\nSo the total number of toys is 20+40=60\n#### 60\n(A): 40.0\nHe buys twice as many toy soldiers as cars\nThis means he buys 2*20=40 toy soldiers\nThis is the total number of toys\n#### 40\n## Argument in favour of B\nJames buys twice as many toy soldiers as toy cars. He buys 20 toy cars, so he buys 2 * 20 = 40 toy soldiers. The total number of toys he buys is the sum of toy cars and toy soldiers: 20 + 40 = 60. Therefore, the correct total number of toys is 60. The answer (A) incorrectly assumes that the total number of toys is only the number of toy soldiers, ignoring the toy cars. Thus, (B) is the correct answer.\n"
