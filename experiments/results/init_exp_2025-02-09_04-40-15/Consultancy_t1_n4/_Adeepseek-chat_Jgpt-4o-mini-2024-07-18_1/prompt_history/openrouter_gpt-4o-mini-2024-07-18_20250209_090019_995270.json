      "content": "QUESTION: Lyra bought a pair of shoes at a 20% discount.  If she paid $480, how much was the original price of the pair of shoes?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 600.0\nLyra only paid $480 for the pair of shoes which is only 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.\nSo let x be the original price.\nThen 0.8x = $480\nThus x = $480 / 0.8 = $600\n#### 600\n(A): 576\nThe discount amount is 20% of $480 = $96\nThe original price is $480 + $96 = $576\n#### 576\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct original price of the shoes is $576. Here's why: Lyra paid $480 after a 20% discount. To find the original price, we need to calculate the discount amount first. A 20% discount on $480 means she saved $96 (20% of $480 = $96). Adding this discount back to the sale price gives the original price: $480 + $96 = $576. This method correctly reverses the discount calculation, ensuring the original price is accurately determined. Therefore, the original price of the shoes is $576.\n"
