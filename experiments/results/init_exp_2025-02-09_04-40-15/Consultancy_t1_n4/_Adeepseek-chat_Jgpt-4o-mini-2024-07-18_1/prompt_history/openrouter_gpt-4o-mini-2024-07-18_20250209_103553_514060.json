      "content": "QUESTION: The bowling alley has 30 red bowling balls. There are 6 more green bowling balls than red. How many bowling balls are there in total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 66.0\nThere are 30 + 6 = 36 green bowling balls\nIn total there are 30 + 36 = 66 bowling balls\n#### 66\n(B): 72.0\nThere are 30 red bowling balls\nFor green balls, we add 6 more than red, so 30 + 6 = 36 green balls\nTotal is 30 + 36 + 6 = 72 bowling balls\n#### 72\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct answer is (A) 66.0. The question states there are 30 red bowling balls and 6 more green bowling balls than red. This means there are 30 + 6 = 36 green bowling balls. To find the total number of bowling balls, we simply add the red and green balls together: 30 + 36 = 66. Answer (B) incorrectly adds an extra 6 to the total, which is already accounted for in the calculation of the green balls. Therefore, the total number of bowling balls is 66.\n"
