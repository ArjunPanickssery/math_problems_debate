      "content": "QUESTION: Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's hair. Emily\u2019s hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's hair. If Logan hair is 20 inches, how many inches is Kate\u2019s hair?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 7.0\nEmily\u2019s hair is 20-6 = 14 inches long.\nKate's hair 14/2= 7 inches long.\n#### 7\n(A): 13\nEmily's hair is 20+6 = 26 inches long.\nKate's hair is 26/2 = 13 inches long.\n#### 13\n## Argument in favour of A\nEmily\u2019s hair is 6 inches longer than Logan\u2019s hair, and Logan\u2019s hair is 20 inches. Therefore, Emily\u2019s hair must be 20 + 6 = 26 inches long. Since Kate\u2019s hair is half as long as Emily\u2019s, we divide 26 by 2, resulting in 13 inches. The calculation is straightforward and aligns with the information provided. The other answer incorrectly subtracts 6 inches from Logan\u2019s hair length, which contradicts the statement that Emily\u2019s hair is longer, not shorter. Thus, 13 inches is the correct length for Kate\u2019s hair.\n"
