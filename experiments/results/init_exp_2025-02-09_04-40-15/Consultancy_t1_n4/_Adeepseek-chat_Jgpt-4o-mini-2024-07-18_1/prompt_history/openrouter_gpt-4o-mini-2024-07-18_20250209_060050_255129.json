      "content": "QUESTION: John buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students.  He has 6 classes and 30 students in each class.  How many packs did he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 360.0\nJohn has 6*30=180 students\nSo he bought 180*2=360 packs\n#### 360\n(A): 12.0\nCalculate number of classes: 6\nMultiply by 2 packs per class: 6*2=12\n#### 12\n## Argument in favour of B\nJohn buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students. The key phrase here is \"for all his students,\" which means the total number of packs is determined by the total number of students, not the number of classes. John has 6 classes with 30 students each, so he has 6*30=180 students in total. Since he buys 2 packs per student, the total number of packs is 180*2=360. The answer is clearly 360, as it directly follows from the given information and the logical interpretation of the question.\n"
