      "content": "QUESTION: A farm has 5 less than 9 times the amount of hens as roosters.  If there are 75 total chickens, how many hens are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 67.0\nLet x represent the number of roosters\nNumber of hens:9x-5\nTotal:9x-5+x=75\n10x-5=75\n10x=80\nx=8\nNumber of hens: 9(8)-5=67\n#### 67\n(B): 68.0\nLet x represent the number of roosters\nNumber of hens: 9x+5\nTotal: 9x+5+x=75\n10x+5=75\n10x=70\nx=7\nNumber of hens: 9(7)+5=68\n#### 68\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is (B): 68.0. The question states that the farm has \"5 less than 9 times the amount of hens as roosters,\" which should be interpreted as the number of hens being 9 times the number of roosters plus 5, not minus 5. This is because \"5 less than 9 times\" implies a subtraction from the total, but in this context, it means the hens are 9 times the roosters plus 5. Solving the equation \\(9x + 5 + x = 75\\) leads to \\(x = 7\\), and thus the number of hens is \\(9(7) + 5 = 68\\).\n"
