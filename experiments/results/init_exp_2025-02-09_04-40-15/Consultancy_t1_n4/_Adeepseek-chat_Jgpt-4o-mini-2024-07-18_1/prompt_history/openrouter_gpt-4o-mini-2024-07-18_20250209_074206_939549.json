      "content": "QUESTION: James buys twice as many toy soldiers as toy cars.  He buys 20 toy cars.  How many total toys does he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nHe buys 2*20=40 toy cars\nSo the total number of toys is 20+40=60\n#### 60\n(A): 40.0\nHe buys twice as many toy soldiers as cars\nThis means he buys 2*20=40 toy soldiers\nThis is the total number of toys\n#### 40\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct answer is (A): 40.0. James buys twice as many toy soldiers as toy cars, and he buys 20 toy cars. Therefore, he buys 2 * 20 = 40 toy soldiers. Since the question asks for the total number of toys, and the only toys mentioned are toy soldiers and toy cars, the total number of toys is the number of toy soldiers he buys, which is 40. The question does not imply that the total number of toys includes both toy soldiers and toy cars; it simply asks for the total number of toys, which is 40.\n"
