      "content": "QUESTION: Asia bought a homecoming dress on sale for $140. It was originally priced at $350. What percentage off did she get at the sale?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nAsia saved $350 - $140 = $210 on the dress.\nThat means she saved $210 / $350 = 0.60 or 60% off on the dress.\n#### 60\n(A): 150\nFind the difference: $350 - $140 = $210\nCalculate the percentage off: $210/$140 = 1.5 or 150%\n#### 150\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is (B): 60.0. To determine the percentage discount, we calculate the amount saved relative to the original price. Asia saved $210 ($350 - $140) on the dress. Dividing the savings by the original price, $210 / $350 = 0.60, or 60%. This calculation aligns with standard discount percentage formulas, which always use the original price as the denominator. Answer (A) incorrectly uses the sale price as the denominator, leading to an inflated and incorrect percentage of 150%. Therefore, Asia received a 60% discount on her dress.\n"
