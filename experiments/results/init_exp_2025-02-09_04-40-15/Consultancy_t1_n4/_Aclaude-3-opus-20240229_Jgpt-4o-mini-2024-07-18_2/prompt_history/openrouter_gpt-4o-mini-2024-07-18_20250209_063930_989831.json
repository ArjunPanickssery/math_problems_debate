      "content": "QUESTION: Lyra bought a pair of shoes at a 20% discount.  If she paid $480, how much was the original price of the pair of shoes?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 600.0\nLyra only paid $480 for the pair of shoes which is only 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.\nSo let x be the original price.\nThen 0.8x = $480\nThus x = $480 / 0.8 = $600\n#### 600\n(A): 576\nThe discount amount is 20% of $480 = $96\nThe original price is $480 + $96 = $576\n#### 576\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe key information provided in the question is:\n- Lyra bought a pair of shoes at a 20% discount\n- She paid $480 for the discounted shoes\nTo determine the original price before the discount, we need to work backwards from the discounted price. The discounted price represents 80% (100% - 20% discount) of the original price.\nLet x be the original price. \n0.8x = $480\nx = $480 / 0.8 = $600\nSo the original price was $600. This matches the reasoning provided for answer choice B.\n</thinking>\n\nThe original price of the shoes must have been $600. Here's why:\n\nLyra paid $480, which was after a 20% discount was applied. This means she only paid 80% of the original price (100% - 20% discount = 80%).\n\nLet x represent the original price before the discount. \n0.8x = $480 \nTo solve for x, divide both sides by 0.8:\nx = $480 / 0.8 \nx = $600\n\nTherefore, the original price of the shoes before the 20% discount was $600. The reasoning in answer choice A is incorrect because it adds the discount amount to the discounted price paid, rather than working backwards from the discounted price to determine the original price.\n"
