      "content": "QUESTION: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 72.0\nMelissa spends 2x3=6 hours driving each month.\nSince there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=72 hours driving each year.\n#### 72\n(A): 144.0\nEach round trip consists of a 3-hour drive to town and a 3-hour drive back, totaling 6 hours per trip.\nSince Melissa makes two trips per month, she drives 6x2=12 hours monthly.\nIn a year, she spends 12x12=144 hours driving.\n#### 144\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe question asks how many hours Melissa spends driving in a year, given that she drives to town twice each month and each round trip takes 3 hours. \n\nMy assigned answer is B, which states that Melissa spends 72 hours driving per year. The reasoning is that each round trip takes 3 hours, so she spends 2 * 3 = 6 hours driving per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total driving time is calculated as 6 * 12 = 72 hours per year.\n\nTo argue that this is correct, I need to show that the 3 hours accounts for the full round trip time, not just the one-way trip to town. The question does specify it takes 3 hours \"to drive to town and back\", supporting that 3 hours is the full round trip duration.\n\nNo tools seem necessary to make this argument, as it just requires carefully reading the details provided in the question and performing basic arithmetic. The key points are:\n1) 3 hours is the round trip time, not one-way \n2) Melissa makes 2 trips per month\n3) There are 12 months in a year\n</thinking>\n\nThe question clearly states that it takes Melissa 3 hours to drive \"to town and back\". This 3 hours accounts for the full round trip time, driving to town and returning home. Since Melissa makes this 3 hour round trip twice per month, she spends a total of 2 * 3 = 6 hours driving each month. \n\nOver the course of a year, with 12 months, Melissa's total annual driving time can be calculated by multiplying her monthly driving time by 12. So that is 6 hours per month * 12 months = 72 hours spent driving each year.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B - Melissa spends 72 hours per year driving to and from town to buy supplies for the poultry farm. The 3 hours is the round trip time, not one-way, so answer A which assumes 3 hours each way is incorrect.\n"
