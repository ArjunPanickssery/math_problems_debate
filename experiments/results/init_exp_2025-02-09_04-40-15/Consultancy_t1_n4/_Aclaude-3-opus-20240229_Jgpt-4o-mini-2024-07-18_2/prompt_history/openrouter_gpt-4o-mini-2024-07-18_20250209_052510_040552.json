      "content": "QUESTION: Sami finds 3 spiders in the playground.  Hunter sees 12 ants climbing the wall.  Ming discovers 8 ladybugs in the sandbox, and watches 2 of them fly away. How many insects are remaining in the playground?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 21.0\nThe children find 3 + 12 + 8 = 23 insects.\nAfter the ladybugs fly away, there are 23 - 2 = 21 insects.\n#### 21\n(A): 18.0\nLet's count the remaining insects:\nAnts remain constant at 12\nFor ladybugs, start with 8 and subtract 2 that flew = 6 ladybugs\nSpiders are not counted in our insect total\nSo total insects = 12 + 6 = 18\n#### 18\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe key pieces of information needed to determine the correct answer are:\n1. The number of each type of creature found (spiders, ants, ladybugs)\n2. The number of ladybugs that flew away\n3. Whether spiders are considered insects or not\nThe question provides all of these details directly, so no additional tools are needed. The most important consideration is whether spiders should be included in the insect count. Spiders are arachnids, not insects, so the correct approach is to only include the ants and ladybugs in the final count.\n</thinking>\n\nSpiders are arachnids, not insects, so they should not be included in the count of insects remaining in the playground. Only the ants and ladybugs are true insects. \n\nThe question states there were originally 12 ants and 8 ladybugs, for a total of 20 insects. Then it says 2 of the ladybugs flew away. So of the insects, 12 ants remain, and the 8 ladybugs are reduced to 6.\n\nTherefore, the total number of insects remaining is 12 ants + 6 ladybugs = 18 insects. The 3 spiders are not relevant since the question specifically asks for the number of insects, not bugs or creatures in general.\n\nSo in summary, by correctly categorizing spiders as arachnids rather than insects, we can conclude that answer choice (A), 18 insects, is the correct answer.\n"
