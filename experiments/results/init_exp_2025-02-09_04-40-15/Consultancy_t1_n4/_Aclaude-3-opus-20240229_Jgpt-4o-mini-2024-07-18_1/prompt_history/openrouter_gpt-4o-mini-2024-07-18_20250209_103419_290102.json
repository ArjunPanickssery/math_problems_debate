      "content": "QUESTION: Tara has a shoebox that is 4 inches tall and 6 inches wide. She puts a square block inside that is 4 inches per side. How many square inches of the box are left uncovered?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 8.0\nThe shoebox is 24 square inches because 4 x 6 = 24\nThe block is 16 square inches because 4 x 4 = 16\nThere are 8 square inches uncovered because 24 - 16 = 8\n#### 8\n(B): 4\nThe shoebox perimeter is 20 (4 + 6) \u00d7 2\nThe block perimeter is 16: 4 \u00d7 4\nThe uncovered space is 20 - 16\n#### 4\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe question is asking about the area of the shoebox that is uncovered, not the perimeter. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of a shape, while the area is the space inside the shape. Since the block fits perfectly height-wise in the shoebox, it will cover an area equal to its width times the shoebox's width. The block is 4 inches wide and the box is 6 inches wide, so the block covers an area of 4 \u00d7 6 = 24 square inches. This leaves 4 square inches of the shoebox's bottom uncovered on one side of the block.\n"
