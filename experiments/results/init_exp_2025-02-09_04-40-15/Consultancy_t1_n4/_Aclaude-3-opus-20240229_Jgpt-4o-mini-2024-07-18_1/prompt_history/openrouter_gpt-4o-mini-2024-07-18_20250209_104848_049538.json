      "content": "QUESTION: Sam has 18 cows.  5 more than half the cows are black.  How many cows are not black?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 4.0\nHalf of the cows: 18/2=9\nBlack cows: 5+9=14\n18-14=4 cows\n#### 4\n(B): 6\nTotal cows plus 5: 18+5 = 23\nHalf of 23 (rounded): 12\nThese are black cows\nNon-black cows: 18-12 = 6\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of A\nHere is my argument for why answer A is correct:\n\nHalf of Sam's 18 cows is 9 cows. The question states that 5 more than half the cows are black. So to calculate the number of black cows, we take half the total cows (9) and add 5, which equals 14 black cows. To determine how many cows are not black, we subtract the number of black cows from the total number of cows: 18 total cows - 14 black cows = 4 non-black cows. Therefore, 4 cows are not black, so answer A is correct.\n"
