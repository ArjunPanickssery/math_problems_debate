      "content": "QUESTION: Twenty years ago, Shane was 2 times older than Garret is now. If Garret is currently 12, how old is Shane now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 44.0\nTwenty years ago, Shane was 12 * 2 = 24 years old\nShane is currently 24 + 20 = 44 years old\n#### 44\n(A): 64.0\nFirst, we know Shane was 2 times Garret's current age of 12\nSo Shane was 12 * 2 = 24\nThen we need to account for the twenty year difference twice\nAdding 20 years for Shane and 20 years for the time difference\nSo Shane is currently 24 + 40 = 64 years old\n#### 64\n## Argument in favour of B\nShane was 24 years old 20 years ago, which we know because he was 2 times Garret's current age of 12 at that time. To find Shane's current age, we simply need to add 20 years to his age from 20 years ago. 24 + 20 = 44, so Shane is 44 years old now.\n"
