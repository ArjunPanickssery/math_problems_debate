If the box contains 12 bars, how many bars did Mike and Rita get (combined)?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 8.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nMike and Rita together got 4+4 = 8 bars\n#### 8\n(A): 4.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nSince Mike and Rita shared the bars, they got 4 bars together\n#### 4\n## Argument in favour of A\nSince Mike, Rita and Anita shared the 12 chocolate bars equally, each person received 4 bars. Mike and Rita are two separate individuals who each got their own equal share. Therefore, the number of bars Mike and Rita got combined is simply the sum of their individual shares: 4 bars for Mike plus 4 bars for Rita equals a total of 4 bars for the two of them together.\n"
