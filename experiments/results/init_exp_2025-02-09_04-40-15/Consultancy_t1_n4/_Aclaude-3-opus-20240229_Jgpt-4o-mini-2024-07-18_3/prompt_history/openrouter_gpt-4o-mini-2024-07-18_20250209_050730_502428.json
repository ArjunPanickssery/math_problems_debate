      "content": "QUESTION: Henry believes in the famous phrase, \"An apple a day, keeps the doctor away.\" If a box contains 14 apples, how many weeks can Henry and his brother spend eating 3 boxes of apples if they each eat 1 apple a day?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 3.0\nThere are a total of 14 apples/box x 3 boxes = 42 apples in the 3 boxes.\nSo, Henry and his brother each have 42 apples / 2 people = 21 apples/person to consume.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, thus, both of them can consume the 3 boxes of apples in 21 / 7 = 3 weeks.\n#### 3\n(B): 6.0\nThere are a total of 14 apples/box \u00d7 3 boxes = 42 apples in the 3 boxes.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, the number of weeks the apples will last is:\n42 apples \u00f7 7 days/week = 6 weeks\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe key to solving this problem is realizing that Henry and his brother are each eating 1 apple per day. With 42 total apples from the 3 boxes, and each person eating 1 apple daily, the apples will last for 42 days.\n\nTo convert this to weeks, we divide the total number of days the apples last (42) by the number of days in a week (7):\n\n42 days \u00f7 7 days/week = 6 weeks\n\nTherefore, the 3 boxes containing a total of 42 apples will last Henry and his brother 6 weeks if they each eat 1 apple per day.\n"
