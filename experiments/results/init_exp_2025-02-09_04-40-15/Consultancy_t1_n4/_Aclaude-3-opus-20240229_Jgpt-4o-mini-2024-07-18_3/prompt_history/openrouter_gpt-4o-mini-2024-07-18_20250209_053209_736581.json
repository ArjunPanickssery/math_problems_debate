      "content": "QUESTION: Henry believes in the famous phrase, \"An apple a day, keeps the doctor away.\" If a box contains 14 apples, how many weeks can Henry and his brother spend eating 3 boxes of apples if they each eat 1 apple a day?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 3.0\nThere are a total of 14 apples/box x 3 boxes = 42 apples in the 3 boxes.\nSo, Henry and his brother each have 42 apples / 2 people = 21 apples/person to consume.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, thus, both of them can consume the 3 boxes of apples in 21 / 7 = 3 weeks.\n#### 3\n(B): 6.0\nThere are a total of 14 apples/box \u00d7 3 boxes = 42 apples in the 3 boxes.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, the number of weeks the apples will last is:\n42 apples \u00f7 7 days/week = 6 weeks\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe key to solving this problem is realizing that Henry and his brother are each eating 1 apple per day. With 42 total apples from the 3 boxes, and each person eating 1 apple daily, the apples will last for 42 days.\n\nTo convert this to weeks, we divide the total number of days the apples last (42) by the number of days in a week (7):\n\n42 days \u00f7 7 days/week = 6 weeks\n\nTherefore, the 3 boxes containing a total of 42 apples will last Henry and his brother 6 weeks if they each eat 1 apple per day.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many apples do Henry and his brother eat collectively in one day? \n\nWhat is the total number of apples in 3 boxes? \n\nHow many days are there in a week? \n\nIf they each eat 1 apple per day, how many apples will they consume in one week? \n\nWhat is the total number of apples available for consumption? \n\nHow do you calculate the number of weeks the apples will last based on their daily consumption? \n\nCan you clarify if the calculation for dividing total apples by daily consumption is correct? \n\nIs there any additional information that might affect the total number of weeks the apples last?\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nHenry and his brother each eat 1 apple per day, so collectively they consume 2 apples per day.\n\nThere are 14 apples in each box, and with 3 boxes the total number of apples is 14 \u00d7 3 = 42 apples.\n\nThere are 7 days in a week.\n\nIf Henry and his brother each eat 1 apple per day, they will consume 2 apples per day \u00d7 7 days = 14 apples in one week.\n\nThe total number of apples available for consumption from the 3 boxes is 42 apples.\n\nTo calculate the number of weeks the apples will last, divide the total number of apples (42) by the number of apples consumed per week (14):\n42 apples \u00f7 14 apples/week = 3 weeks\n\nThe calculation of dividing the total apples by daily consumption (42 apples \u00f7 7 days/week) is incorrect. It should be divided by weekly consumption (14 apples/week) to determine the number of weeks the apples will last.\n\nThere is no additional information provided that would affect the total number of weeks the apples last. The problem clearly states the number of apples per box, the number of boxes, and the daily consumption rate for Henry and his brother.\n"
