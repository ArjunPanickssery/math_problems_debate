If their grandmother has 50 dolls, how many dolls do they have altogether?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 258.0\nIf the grandmother has 50 dolls, Rene's sister, who has 2 more dolls than their grandmother, has 50+2 = 52 dolls.\nTogether, Rene's sister and the grandmother have 52+50 = 102 dolls.\nSince Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, she has 52*3 = 156 dolls.\nAltogether, they have 156+102 = 258 dolls.\n#### 258\n(B): 658.0\nStarting with grandmother's 50 dolls, we first multiply by 3 to get 150.\nAdding 2 gives us the sister's number of dolls: 152.\nSince Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, she has 152*3 = 456 dolls.\nThe total number of dolls is therefore 50+152+456 = 658.\n#### 658\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 258.0\nIf the grandmother has 50 dolls, Rene's sister, who has 2 more dolls than their grandmother, has 50+2 = 52 dolls.\nTogether, Rene's sister and the grandmother have 52+50 = 102 dolls.\nSince Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, she has 52*3 = 156 dolls.\nAltogether, they have 156+102 = 258 dolls.\n#### 258"

          "content": "The answer I am arguing for, (A) 258 dolls in total, is correct based on the given information. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. The grandmother has 50 dolls. \n2. Rene's sister has 2 more dolls than the grandmother. So Rene's sister has 50 + 2 = 52 dolls.\n3. Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister. Since her sister has 52 dolls, Rene has 52 * 3 = 156 dolls.\n4. To find the total, we add up the dolls of all three people: \n   Grandmother: 50 dolls\n   Rene's sister: 52 dolls \n   Rene: 156 dolls\n   50 + 52 + 156 = 258 dolls in total.\n\nThe calculation follows logically from the problem statement. Each step uses the given information to determine the number of dolls for each person, leading to the correct total of 258 dolls altogether.",
