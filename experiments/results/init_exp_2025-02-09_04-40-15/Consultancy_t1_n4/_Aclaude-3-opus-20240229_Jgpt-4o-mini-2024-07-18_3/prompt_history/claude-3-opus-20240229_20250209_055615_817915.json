Calculate his weekly earnings in the new job: $20/hour * 40 hours/week = $800/week\n\n2. Calculate his weekly earnings in the old job: $16/hour * 25 hours/week = $400/week\n\n3. Find the difference in weekly earnings: $800/week - $400/week = $400/week\n\n4. Multiply the difference in weekly earnings by the number of weeks per year: $400/week * 52 weeks/year = $20,800/year\n\nTherefore, Jame makes $20,800 more per year in his new job compared to his old job.",
