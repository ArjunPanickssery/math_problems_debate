      "content": "QUESTION: John wants to finish a show in 5 days.  There are 20 episodes and they are each 30 minutes long.  How many hours does he have to watch a day?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2.0\nHe wants to watch 20*30=600 minutes\nSo he needs to watch 600/60=10 hours\nThat means he needs to watch 10/5=2 hours a day\n#### 2\n(B): 1.2\nFirst find total minutes: 20 * 30 = 600 minutes\nConvert to hours: 600 / 100 = 6 hours total\nDivide by 5 days: 6 / 5 = 1.2 hours per day\n#### 1.2\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo watch the entire show in 5 days, John needs to watch 2 hours per day. There are 20 episodes that are 30 minutes each, so the total watch time is 20 * 30 = 600 minutes. 600 minutes equals 10 hours (600 / 60 = 10). To spread those 10 hours evenly over 5 days, John must watch 10 / 5 = 2 hours each day. Therefore, the correct answer is (A): 2.0 hours per day.\n"
