      "content": "QUESTION: John wants to finish a show in 5 days.  There are 20 episodes and they are each 30 minutes long.  How many hours does he have to watch a day?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2.0\nHe wants to watch 20*30=600 minutes\nSo he needs to watch 600/60=10 hours\nThat means he needs to watch 10/5=2 hours a day\n#### 2\n(B): 1.2\nFirst find total minutes: 20 * 30 = 600 minutes\nConvert to hours: 600 / 100 = 6 hours total\nDivide by 5 days: 6 / 5 = 1.2 hours per day\n#### 1.2\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo watch the entire show in 5 days, John needs to watch 1.2 hours per day. Here's why:\n\nThere are 20 episodes that are each 30 minutes long. So the total number of minutes for the entire show is:\n20 episodes \u00d7 30 minutes/episode = 600 minutes\n\nTo convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:\n600 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes/hour = 10 hours\n\nSince John wants to finish the show in 5 days, we divide the total hours by 5:\n10 hours \u00f7 5 days = 2 hours/day\n\nTherefore, John needs to watch 2 hours of the show per day to finish it in 5 days.\n"
