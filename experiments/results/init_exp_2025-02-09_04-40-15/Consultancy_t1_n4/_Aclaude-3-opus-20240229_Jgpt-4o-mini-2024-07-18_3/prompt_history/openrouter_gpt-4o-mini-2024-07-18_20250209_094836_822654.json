      "content": "QUESTION: A gallon of whole milk that normally costs $3 is now sold at $2. A box of cereal was sold at a discount of $1. How much will you save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 8.0\nThe discount for each gallon of whole milk is $3 - $2 = $1.\nSo the discount for 3 gallons of whole milk is $1/gallon x 3 gallons = $3.\nThe total discount for 5 boxes of cereal is $1/box x 5 boxes = $5.\nYou will save $3 + $5 = $8 for 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal.\n#### 8\n(B): 2.0\nFor milk:\nThe discount per gallon is $2 - $3 = -$1\nFor 3 gallons: -$1 \u00d7 3 = -$3\nFor cereal:\nThe discount is $1 per box\nFor 5 boxes: $1 \u00d7 5 = $5\nTotal savings is -$3 + $5 = $2\n#### 2\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe discount for each gallon of whole milk is $1, since the price was reduced from $3 to $2. Buying 3 gallons of milk at this $1 per gallon discount results in $3 total savings on the milk.\n\nFor the cereal, each box was discounted by $1. Purchasing 5 boxes of cereal with a $1 discount per box leads to $5 in savings on the cereal.\n\nTherefore, the total amount saved by buying 3 gallons of discounted milk and 5 boxes of discounted cereal is $3 + $5 = $8.\n"
