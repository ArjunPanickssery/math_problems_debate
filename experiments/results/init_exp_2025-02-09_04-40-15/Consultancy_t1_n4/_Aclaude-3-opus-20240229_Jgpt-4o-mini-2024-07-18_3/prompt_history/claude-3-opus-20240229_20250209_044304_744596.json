          "content": "To determine the total number of foreign objects in Andrew's dog's fur, we first need to calculate the number of ticks. The problem states that there are six times as many ticks as burrs. Since we know there are 12 burrs, we can multiply 12 by 6 to find the number of ticks:\n\n12 burrs * 6 = 72 ticks\n\nSo there are 72 ticks in the dog's fur. To get the total number of foreign objects, we add the number of ticks to the number of burrs:\n\n72 ticks + 12 burrs = 84 total foreign objects\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) 84 foreign objects total in Andrew's dog's fur.",
