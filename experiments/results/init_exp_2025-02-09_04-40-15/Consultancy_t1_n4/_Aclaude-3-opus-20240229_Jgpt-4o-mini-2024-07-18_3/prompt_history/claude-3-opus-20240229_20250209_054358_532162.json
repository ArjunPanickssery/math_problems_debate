However, Sheryll was given a discount of $0.5 per book when she bought 10 books.\n\nTo calculate the discounted price per book, we subtract the discount from the original price:\n$5 - $0.5 = $4.5 per book\n\nSince Sheryll bought 10 books at this discounted price, we multiply the discounted price by the number of books:\n$4.5 \u00d7 10 = $45\n\nTherefore, the total amount Sheryll paid for the 10 books is $45.",
