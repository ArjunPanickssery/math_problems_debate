      "content": "QUESTION: There are 120 crayons in a box.  One third of the crayons are new, 20% are broken, and the rest are slightly used.  How many are slightly used?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 56.0\nNew:120/3=40 crayons\nBroken:120(.20)=24 crayons\nSlightly Used:120-40-24=56 crayons\n#### 56\n(A): 64.0\nNew:120/3=40 crayons\nRemaining:120-40=80 crayons\nBroken:80(.20)=16 crayons\nSlightly Used:80-16=64 crayons\n#### 64\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo determine the number of slightly used crayons, we need to first calculate the number of new and broken crayons, then subtract those from the total.\n\nThe problem states that one third of the 120 total crayons are new. To calculate one third of 120:\n120 \u00f7 3 = 40 new crayons\n\nIt also says that 20% of the crayons are broken. To calculate 20% of 120:\n120 \u00d7 0.20 = 24 broken crayons\n\nThe remaining crayons must be slightly used. To find this, subtract the new and broken crayons from the total:\n120 - 40 - 24 = 56 slightly used crayons\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 56 slightly used crayons.\n"
