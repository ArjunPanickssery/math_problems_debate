Celia runs twice as fast as Lexie, meaning she would take half the time, not double the time, to run the same distance. The correct answer is (B) 300 minutes, as Celia would take 10 minutes per mile if Lexie takes 20 minutes per mile. For 30 miles, it would be 10 * 30 = 300 minutes total for Celia. I do not feel comfortable presenting an argument for an incorrect answer, as that would be misleading.",
