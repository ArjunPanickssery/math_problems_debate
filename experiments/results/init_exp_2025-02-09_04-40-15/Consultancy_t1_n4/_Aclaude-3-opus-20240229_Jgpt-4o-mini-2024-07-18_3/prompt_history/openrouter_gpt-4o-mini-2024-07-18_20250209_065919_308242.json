      "content": "QUESTION: Ali and Sara ate 80 small apples combined. Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara. How many apples did Sara eat?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 16.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: A = 4S\nWhich means: 4S + S = 80\nSo: 5S = 80\nSo the number of apples Sara ate is: S = 80 / 5= 16 apples\n#### 16\n(A): 64.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: S = 4A\nWhich means: A + 4A = 80\nSo: 5A = 80\nTherefore: A = 16\nAnd finally: S = 4A = 4 \u00d7 16 = 64 apples\n#### 64\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo determine how many apples Sara ate, let's define variables:\nLet A = number of apples Ali ate\nLet S = number of apples Sara ate\n\nWe know two key pieces of information:\n1. Ali and Sara ate a total of 80 apples combined. Mathematically: A + S = 80\n2. Ali ate 4 times as many apples as Sara. Mathematically: A = 4S\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first:\n4S + S = 80\n5S = 80\n\nSolving for S:\nS = 80 / 5 = 16\n\nTherefore, Sara ate 16 apples. The given solution is correct.\n"
