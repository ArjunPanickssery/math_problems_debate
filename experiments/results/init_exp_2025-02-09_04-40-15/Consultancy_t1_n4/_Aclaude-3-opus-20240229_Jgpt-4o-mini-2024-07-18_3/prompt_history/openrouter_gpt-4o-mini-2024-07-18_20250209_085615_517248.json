      "content": "QUESTION: Isabel has some money in her piggy bank. She spent half the amount and bought a toy. She then spent half of the remaining money and bought her brother a book. If she has $51 left, how much money, in dollars, did she have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 204.0\nAfter buying the toy, Isabel has 51*2=102 dollars left.\nIsabel had 102*2=204 dollars at first.\n#### 204\n(A): 408.0\nWorking backwards from what's left:\n51 * 2 = 102 is the previous amount\n102 * 2 = 204 is the amount before that\n204 * 2 = 408 was the initial amount\n#### 408\n## Argument in favour of B\nOkay, I will argue that the correct answer is (B) 204 dollars. Here is my argument:\n\nWe know that after Isabel bought her brother a book, she had $51 left. Since she spent half the remaining money on the book, that means before buying the book she must have had double the $51, which is $102.\n\nNow, we also know that before buying the toy, she spent half the original amount on the toy. So if she had $102 after buying the toy, she must have started with double that amount, which is $204.\n\nTherefore, working backwards, Isabel had $204 in her piggy bank at first before making the two purchases. The correct answer is (B) $204.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total amount Isabel had after buying the toy and before buying the book?  \nHow do we calculate the amount Isabel had before she bought the toy?  \nCan you confirm the sequence of her spending?  \nIs there any possibility that the calculations could lead to a different initial amount?  \nWhat assumptions are being made in the argument for answer (B)?  \nHow does the logic change if we consider the total amount she had after both purchases?  \nIs there a way to verify the calculations for both possible answers?  \nWhat is the significance of the $51 left in relation to her initial amount?  \nCan you clarify how the spending halves affect the total amount?  \nAre there any additional steps or considerations that might change the conclusion?\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nHere are my responses to your enquiries:\n\nThe total amount Isabel had after buying the toy and before buying the book was $102. We know this because she had $51 left after buying the book, which was half of what she had before that purchase. So before buying the book, she had $51 * 2 = $102.\n\nTo calculate the amount before she bought the toy, we double the $102 she had after the toy purchase. This is because she spent half the original amount on the toy. So if $102 was half the original amount, then the original amount was $102 * 2 = $204.\n\nThe sequence was: Isabel started with some amount, spent half on a toy, then spent half of the remainder on a book, leaving her with $51.\n\nThe calculations logically lead to the $204 initial amount. There are no other possibilities given the information provided and the sequence of spending.\n\nThe argument for (B) assumes the amounts spent were exactly half each time, and that no other money was added or removed.\n\nThe logic is the same working forwards from the $51 remainder. $51 is half of the previous amount $102, which itself is half the initial $204.\n\nWe can verify (B) is correct by working forwards: $204 / 2 = $102 after toy, then $102 / 2 = $51 left after book. This confirms (B). The same process shows (A) $408 is incorrect, as it would leave $102 after the book purchase, not $51.\n\nThe $51 is a quarter of her initial amount, as it's half of half of the original. This helps us work backwards to the $204 initial amount.\n\nSpending half each time means the amounts form a sequence where each is double the next: $51 -> $102 -> $204. This is how we can confidently determine the initial amount from the remainder.\n\nI don't see any additional steps or considerations that would change the conclusion that $204 is the correct initial amount. The given information clearly leads to this result.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer is definitively (B) $204, based on a logical analysis of the information provided about Isabel's sequence of spending and the amount remaining. There is no ambiguity or other possible conclusion.\n"
