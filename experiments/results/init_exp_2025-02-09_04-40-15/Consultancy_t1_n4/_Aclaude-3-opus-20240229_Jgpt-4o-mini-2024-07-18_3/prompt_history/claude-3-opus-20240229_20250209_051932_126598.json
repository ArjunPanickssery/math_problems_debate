          "content": "Here is my argument for why the answer is 12 packs:\n\nJohn has 6 classes total. The question states that he buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students. This means he buys 2 packs per class, not per student. To calculate the total packs, we simply need to multiply the number of classes by the packs per class:\n\n6 classes * 2 packs/class = 12 total packs\n\nThe number of students per class is not relevant, since John is buying packs for the class as a whole, not for each individual student. Therefore, the correct answer is that John bought a total of 12 packs of index cards.",
