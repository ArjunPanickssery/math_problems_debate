      "content": "QUESTION: Tom needs to lower a rope down 6 stories.   One story is 10 feet.  The only rope being sold is 20 feet long but you lose 25% when lashing them together.  How many pieces of rope will he need to buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet\nHe loses 20*.25=5 feet each time\nSo he gets 20-5=15 feet from each piece\nThat means he needs 60/15=4 pieces of rope\n#### 4\n(A): 3.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet of rope total\nEach piece of rope is 20 feet\nTherefore he needs 60/20=3 pieces of rope\n#### 3\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo lower the rope down 6 stories, with each story being 10 feet, Tom needs a total of 60 feet of rope. However, the rope is only sold in 20-foot pieces, and he loses 25% of each piece when lashing them together. This means he effectively gets only 15 feet of usable rope from each 20-foot piece he buys, after accounting for the 5 feet lost in lashing. To cover the required 60 feet, he will need to buy 4 pieces of rope, since 60 feet divided by 15 feet per piece equals 4 pieces.\n"
