      "content": "QUESTION: Two companies A and B, are selling bottled milk. Company A sells a big bottle for $4 and Company B sells a big bottle for $3.5. Company A was able to sell 300 and company B 350 big bottles of milk. How much more money did one company make from the other?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 25.0\nCompany A earned 300 * 4 = $1200 for big bottles of milk.\nCompany B earned 350 * 3.5 = $1225 for big bottles of milk.\nCompany B earned 1225 - 1200 = $25 more than company A.\n#### 25\n(A): 325.0\nCompany A sells at $4 and Company B at $3.5, a difference of $0.5 per bottle.\nTotal bottles sold were 300 + 350 = 650 bottles.\nThe difference in earnings was 0.5 * 650 = $325.\n#### 325\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo determine how much more money Company B made compared to Company A, we need to calculate the total revenue for each company from selling big bottles of milk.\n\nCompany A sold 300 big bottles at $4 each. So their total revenue is:\n300 * $4 = $1200\n\nCompany B sold 350 big bottles at $3.50 each. Their total revenue is:\n350 * $3.50 = $1225 \n\nTo find the difference, we subtract Company A's revenue from Company B's:\n$1225 - $1200 = $25\n\nTherefore, Company B made $25 more than Company A from selling big bottles of milk.\n"
