The Physics class has 200 students, and the Biology class has half as many students as the Physics class. So, the number of students in the Biology class is:\n\n200 \u00f7 2 = 100 students\n\nNow, we know there are three times as many girls as boys in the Biology class. Let's represent the number of boys as x. Then, the number of girls would be 3x. The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls:\n\nx + 3x = 100\n4x = 100\nx = 100 \u00f7 4 = 25\n\nTherefore, there are 25 boys in the Biology class.",
