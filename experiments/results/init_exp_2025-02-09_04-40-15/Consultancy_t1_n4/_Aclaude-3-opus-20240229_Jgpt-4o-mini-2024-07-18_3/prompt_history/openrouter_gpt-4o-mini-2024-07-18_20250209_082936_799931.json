      "content": "QUESTION: In 2010 the Chicago Bulls won 70 games. The Miami Heat won 5 more games than the Chicago Bulls.  How many games did the Bulls and the Heat win together?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 145.0\nThe Heat won 5 more games than the Bulls so they won 70 + 5 = 75 games.\nThe total games won together is 70+75 = 145 games.\n#### 145\n(B): 150.0\nThe Heat won 5 more games than the Bulls (70).\nSo the Heat won 75 games.\nThe total games between them would be 70 + 75 + 5 = 150 games.\n#### 150\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe Bulls won 70 games in 2010. The Heat won 5 more games than the Bulls that year. To calculate the total games won by both teams, we simply add the Bulls' 70 wins to the Heat's 75 wins (70 + 5). This gives us a total of 145 games won by the two teams together in 2010.\n"
