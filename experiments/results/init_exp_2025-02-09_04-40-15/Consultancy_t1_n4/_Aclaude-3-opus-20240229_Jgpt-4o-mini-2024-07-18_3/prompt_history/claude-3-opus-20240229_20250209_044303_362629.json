What will be Matt's age 10 years from now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 25.0\nBush is younger than Matt by 3 years, so if Bush is 12 years old then Matt is 12+3 = 15 years old\nIn 10 years' time, Matt will be 10+15 = 25 years old\n#### 25\n(B): 28.0\nBush is 12, Matt is 3 years older, so Matt is 12+3 = 15\nSince Matt will always be 3 years older, we add 3 again: 15+3 = 18\nIn 10 years' time, Matt will be 18+10 = 28\n#### 28\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 25.0\nBush is younger than Matt by 3 years, so if Bush is 12 years old then Matt is 12+3 = 15 years old\nIn 10 years' time, Matt will be 10+15 = 25 years old\n#### 25"
