      "content": "QUESTION: A school choir needs robes for each of its 30 singers. Currently, the school has only 12 robes so they decided to buy the rest. If each robe costs $2, how much will the school spend?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 36.0\nThe school needs to buy 30 - 12 = 18 robes.\nSo the school will spend 18 x $2 = $36.\n#### 36\n(B): 60.0\nTo find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for all singers who need robes.\nWith 30 singers and $2 per robe, the total cost would be 30 x $2 = $60.\n#### 60\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe school choir currently has 12 robes, but needs a total of 30 robes, one for each singer. To determine how many additional robes must be purchased, we subtract the number of robes they already have from the total number needed:\n\n30 total robes needed - 12 robes already owned = 18 additional robes to purchase\n\nEach robe costs $2. To calculate the total cost of purchasing the additional robes, we multiply the number of robes needed by the cost per robe:\n\n18 additional robes x $2 per robe = $36 total cost\n\nTherefore, the school will spend $36 to purchase the additional robes needed for the choir.\n"
