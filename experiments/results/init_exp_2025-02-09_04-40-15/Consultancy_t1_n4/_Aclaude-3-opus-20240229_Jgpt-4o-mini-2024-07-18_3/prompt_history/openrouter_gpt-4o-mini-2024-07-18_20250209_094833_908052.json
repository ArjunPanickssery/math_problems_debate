      "content": "QUESTION: Katie has 13 pink marbles. She has 9 fewer orange marbles than pink marbles. She has 4 times as many purple marbles as orange marbles. How many marbles does Katie have in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 33.0\nFind the number of orange marbles. 13 marbles - 9 marbles = 4 marbles\nFind the number of purple marbles. 4 marbles x 4 = 16marbles\nFind the total amount of pink, orange, and purple marbles. 13 marbles + 4 marbles + 16 marbles = 45 marbles\n#### 33\n(A): 123\nFind the number of orange marbles. 13 marbles + 9 marbles = 22 marbles\nFind the number of purple marbles. 22 marbles \u00d7 4 = 88 marbles\nFind the total amount of pink, orange, and purple marbles. 13 marbles + 22 marbles + 88 marbles = 123 marbles\n#### 123\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo find the total number of marbles, we first need to calculate the number of orange and purple marbles.\n\nKatie has 9 fewer orange marbles than pink marbles. Since she has 13 pink marbles, the number of orange marbles is:\n13 - 9 = 4 orange marbles\n\nKatie has 4 times as many purple marbles as orange marbles. Since she has 4 orange marbles, the number of purple marbles is: \n4 \u00d7 4 = 16 purple marbles\n\nNow we can add up the number of pink, orange, and purple marbles to get the total:\n13 (pink) + 4 (orange) + 16 (purple) = 33 marbles in total\n\nTherefore, Katie has 33 marbles in all.\n"
