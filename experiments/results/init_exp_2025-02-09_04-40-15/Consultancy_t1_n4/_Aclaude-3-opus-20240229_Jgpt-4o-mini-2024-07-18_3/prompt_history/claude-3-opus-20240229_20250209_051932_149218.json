      "content": "QUESTION: June made a design with 20 equal tiles. Three tiles are yellow and the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles. Six tiles are purple and the remaining tiles are white.  How many white tiles are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 7.0\nThere are 3 + 1 = 4 blue tiles.\nThere are a total of 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 tiles are yellow, blue, and purple.\nHence, 20 - 13 = 7 tiles are white.\n#### 7\n(B): 10.0\nThe yellow and blue tiles together total 3 + 1 = 4 tiles.\nAdding the purple tiles gives us 4 + 6 = 10 colored tiles.\nTherefore, 20 - 10 = 10 tiles must be white.\n#### 10\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 7.0\nThere are 3 + 1 = 4 blue tiles.\nThere are a total of 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 tiles are yellow, blue, and purple.\nHence, 20 - 13 = 7 tiles are white.\n#### 7"

And you correctly calculated that the total number of yellow, blue and purple tiles is 3 + 4 + 6 = 13.\n\nSince the design has 20 tiles in total, and 13 of them are colored, the remaining tiles must be white. 20 total tiles minus the 13 colored tiles leaves 7 white tiles, as you determined.\n\nYour step-by-step reasoning clearly shows how you arrived at the correct number of white tiles in June's design.",
