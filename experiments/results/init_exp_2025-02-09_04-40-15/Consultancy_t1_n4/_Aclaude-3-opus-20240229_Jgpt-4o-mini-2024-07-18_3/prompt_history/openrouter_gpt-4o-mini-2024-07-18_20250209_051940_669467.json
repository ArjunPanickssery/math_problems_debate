      "content": "QUESTION: Two companies A and B, are selling bottled milk. Company A sells a big bottle for $4 and Company B sells a big bottle for $3.5. Company A was able to sell 300 and company B 350 big bottles of milk. How much more money did one company make from the other?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 25.0\nCompany A earned 300 * 4 = $1200 for big bottles of milk.\nCompany B earned 350 * 3.5 = $1225 for big bottles of milk.\nCompany B earned 1225 - 1200 = $25 more than company A.\n#### 25\n(A): 325.0\nCompany A sells at $4 and Company B at $3.5, a difference of $0.5 per bottle.\nTotal bottles sold were 300 + 350 = 650 bottles.\nThe difference in earnings was 0.5 * 650 = $325.\n#### 325\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe difference in earnings between Company A and Company B is $325. Company A sells their big bottles of milk for $4 each, while Company B sells theirs for $3.50 each. This means that for every bottle sold, there is a $0.50 difference in price. The total number of bottles sold by both companies combined is 650 (300 by Company A and 350 by Company B). If we multiply the price difference of $0.50 by the total number of bottles sold, 650, we get a total difference in earnings of $325.\n"
