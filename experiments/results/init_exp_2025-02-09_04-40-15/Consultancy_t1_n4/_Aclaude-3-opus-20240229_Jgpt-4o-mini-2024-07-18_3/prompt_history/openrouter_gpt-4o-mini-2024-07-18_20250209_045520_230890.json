      "content": "QUESTION: There are 120 crayons in a box.  One third of the crayons are new, 20% are broken, and the rest are slightly used.  How many are slightly used?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 56.0\nNew:120/3=40 crayons\nBroken:120(.20)=24 crayons\nSlightly Used:120-40-24=56 crayons\n#### 56\n(A): 64.0\nNew:120/3=40 crayons\nRemaining:120-40=80 crayons\nBroken:80(.20)=16 crayons\nSlightly Used:80-16=64 crayons\n#### 64\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo determine the number of slightly used crayons, we first calculate the number of new crayons, which is one third of the total 120 crayons. This gives us 40 new crayons.\n\nWe then subtract the 40 new crayons from the total 120 crayons, leaving us with 80 crayons that are either broken or slightly used.\n\nOut of these remaining 80 crayons, 20% are broken. To calculate this, we take 20% of 80, which equals 16 broken crayons.\n\nFinally, to find the number of slightly used crayons, we subtract the 16 broken crayons from the remaining 80 crayons, giving us 64 slightly used crayons.\n"
