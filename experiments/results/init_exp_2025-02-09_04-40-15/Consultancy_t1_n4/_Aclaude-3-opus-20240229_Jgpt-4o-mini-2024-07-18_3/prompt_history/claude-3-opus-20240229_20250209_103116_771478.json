      "content": "QUESTION: A gallon of whole milk that normally costs $3 is now sold at $2. A box of cereal was sold at a discount of $1. How much will you save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 8.0\nThe discount for each gallon of whole milk is $3 - $2 = $1.\nSo the discount for 3 gallons of whole milk is $1/gallon x 3 gallons = $3.\nThe total discount for 5 boxes of cereal is $1/box x 5 boxes = $5.\nYou will save $3 + $5 = $8 for 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal.\n#### 8\n(B): 2.0\nFor milk:\nThe discount per gallon is $2 - $3 = -$1\nFor 3 gallons: -$1 \u00d7 3 = -$3\nFor cereal:\nThe discount is $1 per box\nFor 5 boxes: $1 \u00d7 5 = $5\nTotal savings is -$3 + $5 = $2\n#### 2\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe discount for each gallon of whole milk is $1, since the price was reduced from $3 to $2. Buying 3 gallons of milk at this $1 per gallon discount results in $3 total savings on the milk.\n\nFor the cereal, each box was discounted by $1. Purchasing 5 boxes of cereal with a $1 discount per box leads to $5 in savings on the cereal.\n\nTherefore, the total amount saved by buying 3 gallons of discounted milk and 5 boxes of discounted cereal is $3 + $5 = $8.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the original price of a box of cereal before the discount?  \nHow much is the discount applied to each box of cereal?  \nIs the discount on the milk calculated based on the new price or the original price?  \nCan you confirm if the total savings should only include discounts or if it can include any price increases?  \nAre there any additional fees or taxes that should be considered when calculating total savings?  \nIs there a specific formula used to calculate savings from discounts in this scenario?  \nAre there any other discounts or promotions that could affect the total savings?  \n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 8.0\nThe discount for each gallon of whole milk is $3 - $2 = $1.\nSo the discount for 3 gallons of whole milk is $1/gallon x 3 gallons = $3.\nThe total discount for 5 boxes of cereal is $1/box x 5 boxes = $5.\nYou will save $3 + $5 = $8 for 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal.\n#### 8"

          "content": "The original price of the cereal is not provided in the question. We only know that each box of cereal has a $1 discount applied to it.\n\nThe discount on each box of cereal is $1. This is clearly stated in the question.\n\nThe discount on the milk is calculated based on the original price of $3 per gallon. The new discounted price is $2 per gallon, so the discount is the difference between the original and new price, which is $1 per gallon.\n\nThe total savings should only include the discounts, not any price increases. We are only considering how much is saved from the stated discounts on the milk and cereal.\n\nThere is no mention of additional fees or taxes in the question. We should calculate the savings based solely on the information provided about the product discounts.\n\nThe formula to calculate the savings is:\n(Original Price - Discounted Price) \u00d7 Quantity \nFor the milk this is ($3 - $2) \u00d7 3 = $3\nFor the cereal this is $1 \u00d7 5 = $5\n\nThe question does not state any other discounts or promotions that would affect the total savings. We must determine the savings based only on the $1 per gallon milk discount and $1 per box cereal discount that are given.\n\nTherefore, the total savings is indeed $3 on milk + $5 on cereal = $8, as calculated in the original answer A.",
