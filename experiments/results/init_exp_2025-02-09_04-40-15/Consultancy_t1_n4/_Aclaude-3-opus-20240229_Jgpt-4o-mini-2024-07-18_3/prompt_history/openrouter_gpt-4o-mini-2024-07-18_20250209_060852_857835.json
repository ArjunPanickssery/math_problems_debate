      "content": "QUESTION: A cat has nine lives.  A dog has 3 less lives than a cat.  A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog.  How many lives does a mouse have?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 13.0\nDog:9-3=6 lives\nMouse:6+7=13 lives\n#### 13\n(A): 19.0\nCat has 9 lives\nDog has 3 more than cat: 9 + 3 = 12 lives\nMouse has 7 more than dog: 12 + 7 = 19 lives\n#### 19\n## Argument in favour of B\nThank you for the question. I will argue that the correct answer is (B): 13 lives for a mouse.\n\nThe problem states that a cat has 9 lives. It then says a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. To calculate the number of lives a dog has, we take the cat's 9 lives and subtract 3. This means a dog has 9 - 3 = 6 lives.\n\nNext, the problem says a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. Since we determined a dog has 6 lives, to get the mouse's lives we add 7 to the dog's 6 lives. This gives us 6 + 7 = 13 lives for a mouse.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that a mouse has 13 lives, which is answer choice (B).\n"
