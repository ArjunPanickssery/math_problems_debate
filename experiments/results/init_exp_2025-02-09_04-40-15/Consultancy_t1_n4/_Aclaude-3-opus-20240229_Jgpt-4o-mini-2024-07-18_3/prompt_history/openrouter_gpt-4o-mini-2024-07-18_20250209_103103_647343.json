      "content": "QUESTION: James buys 3 CDs.  Two of them are 1.5 hours each.  The last one is twice that long.  What is the combined length of the CDs?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 6.0\nThe long CD is 1.5*2=3 hours\nThe two shorter CDs have a combined length of 1.5*2=3 hours\nSo in total the CDs had a length of 3+3= 6 hours\n#### 6\n(B): 4.5\nThe long CD is 1.5*2=3 hours\nThe short CDs have a length of 1.5 hours\nSo in total the CDs had a length of 3+1.5=4.5 hours\n#### 4.5\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo calculate the total length of the CDs, we need to find the length of each CD and add them together.\n\nThe two shorter CDs are each 1.5 hours long. Since there are two of them, their combined length is:\n\n1.5 hours \u00d7 2 = 3 hours\n\nThe last CD is twice as long as each of the shorter ones. Since each shorter CD is 1.5 hours, the long CD is:\n\n1.5 hours \u00d7 2 = 3 hours\n\nNow we can add the lengths of all the CDs:\n\n3 hours (from the two shorter CDs) + 3 hours (from the long CD) = 6 hours total\n\nTherefore, the combined length of all three CDs is 6 hours.\n"
