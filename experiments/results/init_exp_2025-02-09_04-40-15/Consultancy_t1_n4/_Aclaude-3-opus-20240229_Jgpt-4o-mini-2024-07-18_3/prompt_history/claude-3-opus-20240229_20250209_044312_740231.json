There are 4 pints in a gallon, so 4.5 gallons is equal to 4.5 * 4 = 18 pints of coffee total.\n\nThe problem states that the coffee was divided evenly among 18 thermoses. To find the amount of coffee in each thermos, we divide the total pints by the number of thermoses: 18 pints / 18 thermoses = 1 pint per thermos.\n\nSince Genevieve drank 3 thermoses of coffee, and each thermos contained 1 pint, she consumed 1 pint * 3 = 3 pints of coffee in total.",
