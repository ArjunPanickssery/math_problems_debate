Belle eats 2 rawhide bones per evening, not 4. So the correct calculation for the cost of rawhide bones over a week is 2*1*7 = $14, not 4*1*7 = $28. Since this error makes the total cost calculation in answer (A) incorrect, I do not feel I can honestly argue that it is the right answer. The correct answer, as shown in (B), is $21 total for a week of these treats for Belle.",
