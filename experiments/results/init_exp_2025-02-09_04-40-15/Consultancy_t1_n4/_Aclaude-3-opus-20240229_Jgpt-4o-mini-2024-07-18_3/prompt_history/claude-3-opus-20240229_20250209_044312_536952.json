To calculate the total number of students, we multiply the number of classes by the number of students per class:\n\n6 classes * 30 students/class = 180 total students\n\nJohn is buying 2 packs of index cards for each student. So to determine the total number of packs purchased, we take the total number of students and multiply by 2 packs per student:\n\n180 students * 2 packs/student = 360 total packs\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) - John bought a total of 360 packs of index cards for all of his students across the 6 classes.",
