      "content": "QUESTION: Steve decides to read a new book.  He reads 100 pages Monday, Wed, and Friday.  The book is 2100 pages long.  How many weeks does it take to read them all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 7.0\nHe reads 100*3=300 pages a week\nSo it would take 2100/300=7 weeks to read the book\n#### 7\n(A): 3.0\nFirst calculate pages per day: 100 pages\nTotal segments needed: 2100/100 = 21\nDivide by days in a week: 21/7 = 3 weeks\n#### 3\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo convince you that it will take Steve 7 weeks to read the 2100-page book, let's break down the given information:\n\n- Steve reads 100 pages on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday each week.\n- The book has a total of 2100 pages.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many pages Steve reads per week:\n100 pages/day \u00d7 3 days/week = 300 pages/week\n\nSince the book has 2100 pages, we can determine the number of weeks it will take Steve to finish the book:\n2100 pages \u00f7 300 pages/week = 7 weeks\n\nTherefore, reading 300 pages per week, it will take Steve exactly 7 weeks to complete the 2100-page book.\n"
