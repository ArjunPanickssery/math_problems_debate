      "content": "QUESTION: If Stu has 9 books and Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu, how many books do Stu and Albert have in total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 45.0\nAlbert has 4 * 9 books belonging to Stu = 36 books.\nSo the pair have a combined total of 36 books belonging to Albert + 9 books belonging to Stu = 45 books.\n#### 45\n(B): 22.0\nFirst we determine Albert's books by taking Stu's 9 books and adding 4 for each book of Stu's = 13 books.\nThen we add both collections together: 13 + 9 = 22 books total.\n#### 22\n## Argument in favour of B\nHere is my argument for why the total number of books Stu and Albert have is 22:\n\nWe know that Stu has 9 books. And we are told that Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu. To determine how many books Albert has, we take Stu's 9 books and add 4 for each of Stu's books. This means Albert has 9 + 4 = 13 books.\n\nTo get the total, we simply add Stu's 9 books to Albert's 13 books. 9 + 13 = 22 books in total between Stu and Albert.\n"
