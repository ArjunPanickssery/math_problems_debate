      "content": "QUESTION: In Sam's first 100 matches he won 50% of matches.  In his next 100 games, he won 60% of matches.  How many total matches did he win?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 110.0\nHe won 100*.5=50 matches in his first 100 games\nIn his next 100 games, he won 100*.6=60 matches\nSo in total, he won 50+60=110 matches\n#### 110\n(A): 120.0\nSam's final win rate was 60%\nThis means across all 200 matches, he won 200 * 0.6 = 120 matches\n#### 120\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo calculate the total number of matches Sam won, we need to look at his performance in each set of 100 matches separately.\n\nIn the first 100 matches, Sam won 50% of them. This means he won:\n100 matches * 0.50 = 50 matches\n\nIn the next 100 matches, Sam improved and won 60% of them. So in this second set, he won: \n100 matches * 0.60 = 60 matches\n\nTo get his total wins, we simply add the number of matches he won in each set:\n50 matches + 60 matches = 110 total matches won\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Sam won a total of 110 matches out of the 200 he played.\n"
