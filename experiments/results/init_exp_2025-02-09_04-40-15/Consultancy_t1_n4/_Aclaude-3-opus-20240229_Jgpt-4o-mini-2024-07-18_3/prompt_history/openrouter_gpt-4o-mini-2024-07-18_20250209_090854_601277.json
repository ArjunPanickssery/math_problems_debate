      "content": "QUESTION: Sami finds 3 spiders in the playground.  Hunter sees 12 ants climbing the wall.  Ming discovers 8 ladybugs in the sandbox, and watches 2 of them fly away. How many insects are remaining in the playground?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 21.0\nThe children find 3 + 12 + 8 = 23 insects.\nAfter the ladybugs fly away, there are 23 - 2 = 21 insects.\n#### 21\n(A): 18.0\nLet's count the remaining insects:\nAnts remain constant at 12\nFor ladybugs, start with 8 and subtract 2 that flew = 6 ladybugs\nSpiders are not counted in our insect total\nSo total insects = 12 + 6 = 18\n#### 18\n## Argument in favour of A\nSpiders are not insects, so we should not include the 3 spiders in our total count of insects remaining in the playground. Ants and ladybugs are both insects. There are 12 ants that remain on the wall. For the ladybugs, we start with 8 but then 2 fly away, leaving 6 ladybugs in the sandbox. To calculate the total number of insects remaining, we add the 12 ants and the 6 ladybugs, which equals 18 insects total.\n"
