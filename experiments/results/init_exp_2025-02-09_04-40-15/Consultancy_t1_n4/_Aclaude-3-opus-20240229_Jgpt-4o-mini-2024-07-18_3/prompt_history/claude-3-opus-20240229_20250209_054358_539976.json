          "content": "The correct answer is 14 eggs total. Here's how we arrive at that:\n\nIn the first tree, there are 2 nests with 5 eggs each. To calculate the total eggs in that tree, we add the number of nests (2) and the number of eggs per nest (5). So for the first tree, there are 2 + 5 = 7 eggs total.\n\nThe second tree has just 1 nest with 3 eggs. So that's 3 more eggs.\n\nFinally, the nest in June's front yard has 4 eggs. \n\nTo get the grand total, we sum up the eggs from each location:\n7 (first tree) + 3 (second tree) + 4 (front yard) = 14 eggs altogether.",
