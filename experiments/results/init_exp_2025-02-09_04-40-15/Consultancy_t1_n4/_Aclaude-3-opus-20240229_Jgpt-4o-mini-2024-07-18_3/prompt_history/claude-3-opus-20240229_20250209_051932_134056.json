Since Stu has 9 books, we can calculate Albert's books by multiplying Stu's books by 4:\n\nAlbert's books = 4 * Stu's books\n                  = 4 * 9 \n                  = 36 books\n\nTo find the total number of books Stu and Albert have together, we simply add Stu's books and Albert's books:\n\nTotal books = Stu's books + Albert's books\n                = 9 + 36\n                = 45 books\n\nTherefore, Stu and Albert have a combined total of 45 books.",
