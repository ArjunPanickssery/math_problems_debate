      "content": "QUESTION: John was 66 inches tall.  He had a growth spurt and grew 2 inches per month for 3 months.  How tall is he in feet?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 6.0\nHe gained 2*3=6 inches\nSo his height is 66+6=72 inches\nSo he is 72/12=6 feet tall\n#### 6\n(B): 17.0\nFirst find total change in height:\n(66+2)*3 = 68*3 = 204 inches\nConvert to feet: 204/12 = 17 feet\n#### 17.0\n## Argument in favour of A\nHere is my argument for answer (A):\n\nJohn started at a height of 66 inches. Over the course of 3 months, he grew by 2 inches each month. To calculate his total growth, we multiply the growth per month (2 inches) by the number of months (3). This gives us a total growth of 2 * 3 = 6 inches.\n\nTo find John's new height, we add his total growth to his starting height:\n66 inches + 6 inches = 72 inches\n\nFinally, to convert his height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot:\n72 inches / 12 inches per foot = 6 feet\n\nTherefore, after his 3 month growth spurt, John is now 6 feet tall.\n"
