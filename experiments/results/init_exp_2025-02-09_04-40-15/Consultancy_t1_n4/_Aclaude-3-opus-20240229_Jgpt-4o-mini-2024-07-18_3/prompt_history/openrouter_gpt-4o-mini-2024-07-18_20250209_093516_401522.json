      "content": "QUESTION: Mary has 26 blue shirts and 36 brown shirts. If she gives away half of her blue shirts and a third of her brown shirts, how many shirts does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 37.0\nMary gives away 26/2 = 13 blue shirts.\nMary gives away 36/3 = 12 brown shirts.\nMary has 26-13 = 13 blue shirts left.\nMary has 36-12 = 24 brown shirts left.\nMary has 13+24 = 37 shirts left.\n#### 37\n(A): 35.0\nMary gives away 36/2 = 18 brown shirts.\nMary gives away 26/3 \u2248 9 blue shirts.\nMary has 26-9 = 17 blue shirts left.\nMary has 36-18 = 18 brown shirts left.\nMary has 17+18 = 35 shirts left.\n#### 35\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo determine how many shirts Mary has left, we need to calculate the number of blue and brown shirts she keeps after giving some away.\n\nMary starts with 26 blue shirts. The question states she gives away half of them. Half of 26 is 26/2 = 13. So Mary gives away 13 blue shirts, leaving her with 26 - 13 = 13 blue shirts.\n\nMary also has 36 brown shirts initially. She gives away a third of them. A third of 36 is 36/3 = 12. After giving away 12 brown shirts, Mary is left with 36 - 12 = 24 brown shirts.\n\nIn total, Mary now has 13 blue shirts and 24 brown shirts remaining. Adding these together, 13 + 24 = 37. Therefore, the correct answer is that Mary has 37 shirts left.\n"
