          "content": "I apologize, but I cannot argue for an incorrect answer. The correct answer is that the housewife has $50 left, not $100. Here's why:\n\nThe housewife started with $150 total. She spent 2/3 of that amount. To calculate what's left, we need to find 1/3 of $150, since 1/3 is the fraction remaining (3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3).\n\n1/3 of $150 is calculated as:\n$150 * (1/3) = $50\n\nTherefore, the amount the housewife has left after spending 2/3 of her $150 is $50. Multiplying by 2/3 calculates the amount spent, not the amount remaining.\n\nI hope this explanation clarifies why answer (B) $50 is correct rather than answer (A) $100.
