          "content": "To find the number of apples Kayla picked, let's define a variable for Kylie's apples. Let x be the number Kylie picked. The question states Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times Kylie's amount. So Kayla picked 4x + 10 apples. Together they picked 340 apples total. We can write an equation: x + (4x + 10) = 340. Simplifying, 5x + 10 = 340. Subtracting 10 from both sides gives 5x = 330. Dividing by 5 yields x = 66. So Kylie picked 66 apples. Plugging this back in, Kayla picked 4(66) + 10 = 274 apples.",
