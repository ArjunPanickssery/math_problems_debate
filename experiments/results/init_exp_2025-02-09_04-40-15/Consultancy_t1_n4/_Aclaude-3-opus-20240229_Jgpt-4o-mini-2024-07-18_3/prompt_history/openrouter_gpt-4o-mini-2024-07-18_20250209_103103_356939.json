      "content": "QUESTION: James buys twice as many toy soldiers as toy cars.  He buys 20 toy cars.  How many total toys does he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nHe buys 2*20=40 toy cars\nSo the total number of toys is 20+40=60\n#### 60\n(A): 40.0\nHe buys twice as many toy soldiers as cars\nThis means he buys 2*20=40 toy soldiers\nThis is the total number of toys\n#### 40\n## Argument in favour of A\nI believe the correct answer is that James buys a total of 40 toys. The problem states that he buys twice as many toy soldiers as toy cars, and that he buys 20 toy cars. This means that the number of toy soldiers is 2 times 20, which equals 40. Since the question asks for the total number of toys, and the only toys mentioned are the 20 cars and the 40 soldiers, the total is simply 20 + 40 = 40 toys.\n"
