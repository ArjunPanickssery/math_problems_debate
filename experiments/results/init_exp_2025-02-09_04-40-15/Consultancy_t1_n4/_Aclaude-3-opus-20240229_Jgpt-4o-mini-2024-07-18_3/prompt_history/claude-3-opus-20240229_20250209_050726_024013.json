The question states that Jack buys a squat rack for $2500 and a barbell that costs 1/10 as much. 1/10 of $2500 is indeed $250, but this is the additional cost of the barbell, not a discount. To calculate the total amount Jack paid, we need to add the $2500 for the squat rack and the $250 for the barbell, which equals $2750 total.",
