          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 6.0. Here's why:\n\nPeter has read 40% of the 20 books. To calculate how many books that is, we multiply 20 by 0.4, which equals 8 books.\n\nPeter's brother has read 10% of the 20 books. 10% of 20 is found by multiplying 20 by 0.1, which equals 2 books.\n\nTo determine how many more books Peter has read compared to his brother, we simply subtract the number of books his brother read from the number Peter read: 8 - 2 = 6.\n\nTherefore, Peter has read 6 more books than his brother. The question is asking for the absolute difference in number of books read, not a scaled difference.",
