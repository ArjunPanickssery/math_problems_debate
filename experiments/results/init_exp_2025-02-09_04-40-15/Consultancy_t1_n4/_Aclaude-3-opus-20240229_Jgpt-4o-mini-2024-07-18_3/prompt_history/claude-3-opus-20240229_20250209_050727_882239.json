          "content": "Thank you for the question. I will argue that the correct answer is (B): 13 lives for a mouse.\n\nThe problem states that a cat has 9 lives. It then says a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. To calculate the number of lives a dog has, we take the cat's 9 lives and subtract 3. This means a dog has 9 - 3 = 6 lives.\n\nNext, the problem says a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. Since we determined a dog has 6 lives, to get the mouse's lives we add 7 to the dog's 6 lives. This gives us 6 + 7 = 13 lives for a mouse.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that a mouse has 13 lives, which is answer choice (B).",
