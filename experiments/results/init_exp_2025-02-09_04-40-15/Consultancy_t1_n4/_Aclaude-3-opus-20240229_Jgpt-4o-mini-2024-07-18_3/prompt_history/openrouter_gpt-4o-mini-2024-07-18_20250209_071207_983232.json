      "content": "QUESTION: Susie's pet lizard Moe takes 10 seconds to eat 40 pieces of cuttlebone each day. How long would it take Moe to eat 800 pieces?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 200.0\nIf it takes Moe 10 seconds to eat 40 cuttlebones, then in one second she eats 40 cuttlebones / 10 seconds = 4 cuttlebones/second\nSince the cat eats 4 pieces of cuttlebone in 1 second, 800 pieces will be 800 cuttlebones / 4 cuttlebones/second = 200 seconds.\n#### 200\n(A): 320.0\nFirst, we need to find how many seconds it takes per piece of cuttlebone:\n10 seconds / 40 pieces = 0.25 seconds per piece\nThen we multiply this rate by the total number of pieces:\n800 pieces * 0.25 seconds/piece = 320 seconds\n#### 320\n## Argument in favour of B\nYou're right that if Moe eats 40 cuttlebones in 10 seconds, then Moe is eating at a rate of 4 cuttlebones per second. \n\nTo calculate how long it would take Moe to eat 800 cuttlebones at this rate, we can set up the equation:\n4 cuttlebones/second * x seconds = 800 cuttlebones\n\nSolving for x:\nx seconds = 800 cuttlebones / (4 cuttlebones/second) \nx = 200 seconds\n\nTherefore, at a rate of 4 cuttlebones per second, it would take Moe 200 seconds to eat 800 cuttlebones total. The key is recognizing the rate Moe eats at, and then using that rate to determine the total time for 800 cuttlebones.\n"
