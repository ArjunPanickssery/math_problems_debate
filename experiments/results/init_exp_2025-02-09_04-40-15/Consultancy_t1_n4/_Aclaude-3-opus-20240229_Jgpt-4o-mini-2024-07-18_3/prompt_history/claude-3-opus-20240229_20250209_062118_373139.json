          "content": "To determine how many pints of tea Geraldo drank, we first need to convert the total volume of tea from gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so 20 gallons equals 160 pints (20 * 8 = 160). \n\nThe 160 pints of tea were then divided equally among 80 containers. To calculate the amount of tea in each container, we divide 160 pints by 80, which equals 2 pints per container (160 / 80 = 2).\n\nSince Geraldo drank 3.5 containers worth of tea, we multiply 3.5 by 2 pints per container to get the total pints he consumed. 3.5 * 2 = 7 pints.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Geraldo drank 7 pints of tea.",
