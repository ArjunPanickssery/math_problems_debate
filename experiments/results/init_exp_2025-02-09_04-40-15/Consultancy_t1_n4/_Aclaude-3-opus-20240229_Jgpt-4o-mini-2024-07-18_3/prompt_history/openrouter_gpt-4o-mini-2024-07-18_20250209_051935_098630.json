      "content": "QUESTION: Isaac cut his 30 meters ribbon into 6 equal parts. He then used 4 parts of the ribbon. How many meters of ribbon are not used?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 10.0\nEach part is 30/6 = 5 meters long.\nSince Liam used 4 parts, then he used 5 x 4 = 20 meters of the ribbon.\nSo, 30 - 20 = 10 meters of ribbon is not used.\n#### 10\n(B): 15.0\nThe ribbon was cut into 6 parts, and 4 were used, leaving 2 parts unused.\nEach part is 30/4 = 7.5 meters long.\nTherefore 2 \u00d7 7.5 = 15 meters were not used.\n#### 15\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo determine how many meters of ribbon were not used, we first need to calculate the length of each part. Since the 30 meter ribbon was cut into 6 equal parts, the length of each part is 30 \u00f7 6 = 5 meters.\n\nIsaac used 4 out of the 6 parts. So the total length of ribbon he used is 4 \u00d7 5 meters = 20 meters.\n\nThe original ribbon was 30 meters long. Isaac used 20 meters of it. Therefore, the amount of ribbon not used is 30 meters - 20 meters = 10 meters.\n"
