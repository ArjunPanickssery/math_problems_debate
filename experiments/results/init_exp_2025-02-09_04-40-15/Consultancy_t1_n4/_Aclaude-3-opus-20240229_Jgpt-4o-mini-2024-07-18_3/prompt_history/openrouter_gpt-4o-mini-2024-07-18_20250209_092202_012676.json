      "content": "QUESTION: John has to restring 3 basses with 4 strings each, twice as many guitars which have 6 strings each, and 3 fewer 8 string guitars than the normal guitars.  How many strings does he need?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 72.0\nThe basses take 3*4=12 strings\nHe restrings 2*3=6 normal guitars\nThat takes 6*6=36 strings\nHe restrings 6-3=3 guitars with 8 strings\nSo that uses 3*8=24 strings\nSo he uses 12+36+24=72 strings\n#### 72\n(B): 96.0\nThe basses take 3*4=12 strings\nHe restrings 2*3=6 normal guitars\nThat takes 6*6=36 strings\nFor 8-string guitars, we need 6 guitars\nSo that uses 6*8=48 strings\nSo he uses 12+36+48=96 strings\n#### 96\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo calculate the total number of strings needed, let's break it down:\n\n1. John has 3 basses, each with 4 strings. So for the basses, he needs:\n   3 basses \u00d7 4 strings per bass = 12 strings\n\n2. He has twice as many guitars as basses, which is 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 guitars. Each guitar has 6 strings. So for the guitars, he needs:\n   6 guitars \u00d7 6 strings per guitar = 36 strings\n\n3. He also has 3 fewer 8-string guitars than normal 6-string guitars. Since he has 6 normal guitars, he has 6 - 3 = 3 8-string guitars. For these, he needs: \n   3 8-string guitars \u00d7 8 strings per guitar = 24 strings\n\n4. To get the total, we sum the strings for basses, guitars, and 8-string guitars:\n   12 + 36 + 24 = 72 strings\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A): John needs a total of 72 strings.\n"
