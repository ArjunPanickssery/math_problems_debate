Since Mr. Chiu has 56, we can calculate that Mr. Phung has 56 + 16 = 72 silver dollars.\n\nThe key is that Mr. Ha has 5 more silver dollars than Mr. Phung, not 5 more than Mr. Chiu. Since Mr. Phung has 72 silver dollars, Mr. Ha must have 72 + 5 = 77 silver dollars. \n\nTherefore, the total number of silver dollars the three have is:\nMr. Chiu: 56\nMr. Phung: 72 \nMr. Ha: 77\n56 + 72 + 77 = 205\n\nSo the correct total is 205 silver dollars, which corresponds to answer choice (A).",
