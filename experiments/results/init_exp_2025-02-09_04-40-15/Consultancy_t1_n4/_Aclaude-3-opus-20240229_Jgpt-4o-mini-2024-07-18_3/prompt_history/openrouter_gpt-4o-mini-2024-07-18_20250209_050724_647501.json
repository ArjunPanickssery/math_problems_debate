      "content": "QUESTION: Lyra bought a pair of shoes at a 20% discount.  If she paid $480, how much was the original price of the pair of shoes?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 600.0\nLyra only paid $480 for the pair of shoes which is only 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.\nSo let x be the original price.\nThen 0.8x = $480\nThus x = $480 / 0.8 = $600\n#### 600\n(A): 576\nThe discount amount is 20% of $480 = $96\nThe original price is $480 + $96 = $576\n#### 576\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe original price of the shoes must have been $600. Lyra paid $480, which was after a 20% discount. This means she paid 80% of the original price. To find the original price, we can set up the equation:\n\n0.8x = 480\n\nWhere x is the original price. Solving for x:\n\nx = 480 / 0.8 = 600\n\nTherefore, the shoes originally cost $600 before the 20% discount was applied. The key is recognizing that the discounted price is a percentage of the original price.\n"
