      "content": "QUESTION: Melissa works on a poultry farm. She drives to town twice each month to buy supplies. If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 72.0\nMelissa spends 2x3=6 hours driving each month.\nSince there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=72 hours driving each year.\n#### 72\n(A): 144.0\nEach round trip consists of a 3-hour drive to town and a 3-hour drive back, totaling 6 hours per trip.\nSince Melissa makes two trips per month, she drives 6x2=12 hours monthly.\nIn a year, she spends 12x12=144 hours driving.\n#### 144\n## Argument in favour of B\nYou're right that Melissa spends 6 hours driving each month, since she makes two 3-hour round trips to town monthly. However, your calculation for the total hours spent driving in a year is incorrect. There are 12 months in a year, so to find the yearly total, we need to multiply the monthly driving hours by 12. This gives us 6 hours per month * 12 months = 72 hours spent driving in a year. Therefore, the correct answer is indeed 72 hours, as stated in option (B).\n"
