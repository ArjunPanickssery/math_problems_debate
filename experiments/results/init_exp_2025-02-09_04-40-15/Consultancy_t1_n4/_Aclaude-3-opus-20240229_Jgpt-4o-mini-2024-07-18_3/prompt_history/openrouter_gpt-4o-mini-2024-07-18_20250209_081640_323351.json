      "content": "QUESTION: In a bookstore, a book costs $5. When Sheryll bought 10 books, she was given a discount of $0.5 each. How much did Sheryll pay in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 45.0\nInstead of $5 each, a book costs $5 - $0.5 = $4.5 each.\nSheryll paid $4.5/book x 10 books = $45.\n#### 45\n(B): 55.0\nThe regular price is $5 per book.\nThe $0.5 discount is added to each book's price: $5 + $0.5 = $5.5 per book.\nTotal cost is $5.5 \u00d7 10 = $55.\n#### 55\n## Argument in favour of A\nYou're right, the correct answer is (A): $45.\n\nThe problem states that each book originally costs $5. However, Sheryll was given a discount of $0.5 per book when she bought 10 books.\n\nTo calculate the discounted price per book, we subtract the discount from the original price:\n$5 - $0.5 = $4.5 per book\n\nSince Sheryll bought 10 books at this discounted price, we multiply the discounted price by the number of books:\n$4.5 \u00d7 10 = $45\n\nTherefore, the total amount Sheryll paid for the 10 books is $45.\n"
