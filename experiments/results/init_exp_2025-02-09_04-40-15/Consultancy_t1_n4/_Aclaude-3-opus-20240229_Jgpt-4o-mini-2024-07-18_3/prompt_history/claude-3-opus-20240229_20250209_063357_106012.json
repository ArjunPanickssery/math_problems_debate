How many square inches of the box are left uncovered?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 8.0\nThe shoebox is 24 square inches because 4 x 6 = 24\nThe block is 16 square inches because 4 x 4 = 16\nThere are 8 square inches uncovered because 24 - 16 = 8\n#### 8\n(B): 4\nThe shoebox perimeter is 20 (4 + 6) \u00d7 2\nThe block perimeter is 16: 4 \u00d7 4\nThe uncovered space is 20 - 16\n#### 4\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 8.0\nThe shoebox is 24 square inches because 4 x 6 = 24\nThe block is 16 square inches because 4 x 4 = 16\nThere are 8 square inches uncovered because 24 - 16 = 8\n#### 8"

To find the area of the shoebox, multiply the height by the width:\n\n4 inches \u00d7 6 inches = 24 square inches\n\nThe block is a square with sides measuring 4 inches. To find the area of the square block, multiply the length of one side by itself:\n\n4 inches \u00d7 4 inches = 16 square inches\n\nNow, subtract the area of the block from the area of the shoebox to find the uncovered area:\n\n24 square inches - 16 square inches = 8 square inches\n\nTherefore, 8 square inches of the shoebox are left uncovered.",
