      "content": "QUESTION: In the engineering department, 70% of the students are men and 180 are women. How many men are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 420.0\nThe percentage for women is 100% - 70% = 30%.\nSince 180 represents 30%, then 180/30 = 6 students represent 1%.\nHence, 6 x 70 = 420 students are men.\n#### 420\n(B): 126\nSince 70% of students are men, we can find the number by taking 70% of 180:\n180 \u00d7 0.7 = 126 men in the department.\n#### 126\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo determine the number of men, we need to calculate what 70% of the total number of students represents. We know that 180 women make up 30% of the students. Since 30% is 180 students, we can determine that each 1% is represented by 6 students (180 divided by 30). \n\nTherefore, 70% of the students would be 70 times 6, which equals 420 men in the engineering department.\n"
