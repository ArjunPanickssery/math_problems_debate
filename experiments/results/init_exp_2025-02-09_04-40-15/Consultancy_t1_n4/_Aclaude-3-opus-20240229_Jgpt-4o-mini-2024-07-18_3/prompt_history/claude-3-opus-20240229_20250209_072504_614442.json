      "content": "QUESTION: Tom needs to lower a rope down 6 stories.   One story is 10 feet.  The only rope being sold is 20 feet long but you lose 25% when lashing them together.  How many pieces of rope will he need to buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet\nHe loses 20*.25=5 feet each time\nSo he gets 20-5=15 feet from each piece\nThat means he needs 60/15=4 pieces of rope\n#### 4\n(A): 3.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet of rope total\nEach piece of rope is 20 feet\nTherefore he needs 60/20=3 pieces of rope\n#### 3\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo lower the rope down 6 stories, with each story being 10 feet, Tom needs a total of 60 feet of rope. However, the rope is only sold in 20-foot pieces, and he loses 25% of each piece when lashing them together. This means he effectively gets only 15 feet of usable rope from each 20-foot piece he buys, after accounting for the 5 feet lost in lashing. To cover the required 60 feet, he will need to buy 4 pieces of rope, since 60 feet divided by 15 feet per piece equals 4 pieces.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow is the 25% loss calculated when lashing the ropes together? Is it applied to the total length of the rope or to each individual piece? \n\nWhat is the total usable length of rope after lashing two pieces together? \n\nIs there any additional loss in length when lashing multiple pieces together, or is it a one-time loss per piece? \n\nCould you clarify if the 25% loss is a fixed amount or if it varies depending on how many pieces are used? \n\nAre there any other factors that could affect the length of rope Tom will need, such as the method of lashing or the type of knot used? \n\nIs there a standard practice for calculating usable rope length in this scenario?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 4.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet\nHe loses 20*.25=5 feet each time\nSo he gets 20-5=15 feet from each piece\nThat means he needs 60/15=4 pieces of rope\n#### 4"

          "content": "The 25% loss is applied to each individual 20-foot piece of rope when lashing them together. So for every piece used, 5 feet (25% of 20 feet) is lost in the lashing process.\n\nWhen lashing two pieces together, the total usable length would be 30 feet. This is calculated as (20 feet - 5 feet loss) + (20 feet - 5 feet loss) = 15 feet + 15 feet = 30 feet.\n\nThe 25% loss is incurred for each piece used, so the total loss increases with more pieces. It's not a one-time loss.\n\nThe 5-foot loss is fixed per piece, based on the given 25% loss rate and 20-foot piece length. It doesn't vary with the total number of pieces.\n\nFactors like lashing method or knot type are not mentioned, so we assume the 25% loss accounts for the standard practice in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, with a 5-foot loss per piece, only 15 feet of usable rope is obtained from each 20-foot piece purchased. To reach the required 60 feet, 4 pieces must be bought, as 60 feet / 15 feet per piece = 4 pieces.",
