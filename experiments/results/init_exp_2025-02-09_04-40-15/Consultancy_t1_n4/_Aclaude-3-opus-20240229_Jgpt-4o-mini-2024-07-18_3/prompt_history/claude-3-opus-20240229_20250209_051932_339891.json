What is the combined length of the CDs?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 6.0\nThe long CD is 1.5*2=3 hours\nThe two shorter CDs have a combined length of 1.5*2=3 hours\nSo in total the CDs had a length of 3+3= 6 hours\n#### 6\n(B): 4.5\nThe long CD is 1.5*2=3 hours\nThe short CDs have a length of 1.5 hours\nSo in total the CDs had a length of 3+1.5=4.5 hours\n#### 4.5\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 6.0\nThe long CD is 1.5*2=3 hours\nThe two shorter CDs have a combined length of 1.5*2=3 hours\nSo in total the CDs had a length of 3+3= 6 hours\n#### 6"

Since there are two of them, their combined length is:\n\n1.5 hours \u00d7 2 = 3 hours\n\nThe last CD is twice as long as each of the shorter ones. Since each shorter CD is 1.5 hours, the long CD is:\n\n1.5 hours \u00d7 2 = 3 hours\n\nNow we can add the lengths of all the CDs:\n\n3 hours (from the two shorter CDs) + 3 hours (from the long CD) = 6 hours total\n\nTherefore, the combined length of all three CDs is 6 hours.",
