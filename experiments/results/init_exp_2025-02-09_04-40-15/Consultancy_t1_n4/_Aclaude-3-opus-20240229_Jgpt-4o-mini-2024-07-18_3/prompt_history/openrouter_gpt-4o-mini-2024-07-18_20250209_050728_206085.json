      "content": "QUESTION: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 828.0\nA single watermelon would sell for $2 x 23 = $46\n60 watermelons would sell for $46 x 18 = $828\n#### 828\n(B): 1656\nSince these are $2 per pound watermelons, first calculate the base price:\n$2 x 23 = $46 per watermelon\nFor 18 watermelons: $46 x 18 = $828\nFinally, account for the per-pound pricing: $828 x 2 = $1656\n#### 1656\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo calculate the total revenue from selling 18 watermelons, we first need to determine the price of a single watermelon. Since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds and Farmer Kent charges $2 per pound, the price of one watermelon is:\n\n$2 per pound \u00d7 23 pounds = $46 per watermelon\n\nNow that we know the price of a single watermelon, we can calculate the total revenue from selling 18 watermelons:\n\n$46 per watermelon \u00d7 18 watermelons = $828\n\nTherefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 by selling 18 watermelons that each weigh 23 pounds at $2 per pound.\n"
