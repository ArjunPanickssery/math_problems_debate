      "content": "QUESTION: Hilary is shucking corn from ears that grew on her farm. She gets four ears of corn per stalk, and she has 108 stalks growing. Half the ears of corn have 500 kernels of corn and the other half have 100 more. How many kernels of corn does Hilary have to shuck?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 237600.0\nShe has 108 * 4 = 432 ears of corn to shuck.\nShe gets 500 kernels of corn from half the ears and 500 + 100 = 600 kernels from the other half.\nHalf the number of ears of corn is 432 / 2 = 216 ears.\nThus, Hilary has 216 * 500 + 216 * 600 = 108000 + 129600 = 237600 kernels to shuck.\n#### 237600\n(B): 259200\nShe has 108 * 4 = 432 ears of corn to shuck.\nEach ear of corn has 500 kernels as a base amount.\nAdding the additional 100 kernels to each ear gives 600 kernels per ear.\nThus, Hilary has 432 * 600 = 259200 kernels to shuck.\n#### 259200\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct answer is (A): 237600 kernels of corn. Here's why:\n\nHilary has 108 stalks of corn, with each stalk producing 4 ears. So in total, she has 108 * 4 = 432 ears of corn to shuck.\n\nThe problem states that half the ears have 500 kernels, while the other half have 100 more, which is 600 kernels. \n\nTo calculate the total number of kernels, we first determine how many ears have 500 kernels and how many have 600. Since there are 432 ears total, half of that is 432 / 2 = 216 ears in each category.\n\nFor the 216 ears with 500 kernels each, the total kernels is 216 * 500 = 108000.\nFor the other 216 ears with 600 kernels each, it's 216 * 600 = 129600.\n\nAdding those together gives the total: 108000 + 129600 = 237600 kernels of corn for Hilary to shuck.\n"
