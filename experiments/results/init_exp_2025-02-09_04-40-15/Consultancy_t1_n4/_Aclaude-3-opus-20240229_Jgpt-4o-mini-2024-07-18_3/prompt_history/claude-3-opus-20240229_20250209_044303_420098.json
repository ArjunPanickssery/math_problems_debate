          "content": "Here is my argument for why answer (A) is correct:\n\nIn January, Brianne saves $10. \nIn February, she saves twice as much as January, which is $10 x 2 = $20. Her total savings are now $10 + $20 = $30.\nIn March, she saves twice her February savings, which is $20 x 2 = $40. Her total is now $30 + $40 = $70.  \nIn April, she saves twice her March savings of $40, which is $80. Her total is $70 + $80 = $150.\nFinally in May, she saves twice her April amount of $80, which comes to $160. Adding this to her previous total of $150 gives $150 + $160 = $310 total saved by the end of May.\n\nTherefore, Brianne will save $160 in the month of May, and have total cumulative savings of $310 by the end of May.",
