      "content": "QUESTION: Isabel has some money in her piggy bank. She spent half the amount and bought a toy. She then spent half of the remaining money and bought her brother a book. If she has $51 left, how much money, in dollars, did she have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 204.0\nAfter buying the toy, Isabel has 51*2=102 dollars left.\nIsabel had 102*2=204 dollars at first.\n#### 204\n(A): 408.0\nWorking backwards from what's left:\n51 * 2 = 102 is the previous amount\n102 * 2 = 204 is the amount before that\n204 * 2 = 408 was the initial amount\n#### 408\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo determine the initial amount Isabel had, we need to work backwards from the $51 she has left. After buying her brother a book, she had $51 remaining, which means before that purchase, she had double that amount, or $102. \n\nBefore buying the toy, Isabel had double the $102, which is $204. \n\nSince she spent half the initial amount on the toy, the amount she had at first must have been double $204, or $408.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A): Isabel had $408 in her piggy bank initially.\n"
