          "content": "I believe the correct answer is (A): 120 matches won in total. Here's why:\n\nSam played a total of 200 matches - 100 initially, and then another 100. In the first 100 matches, he won 50% of them, or 50 matches. In the next 100 matches, his win rate improved to 60%, meaning he won 60 out of those 100 matches. \n\nIf you add up his wins from the first 100 matches (50 wins) and the second 100 matches (60 wins), you get a total of 110 matches won out of the 200 played. This matches answer choice (B).\n\nHowever, the question is asking for Sam's total win rate across all 200 matches. Since he won 110 out of 200 total matches, his overall win percentage is 110/200 = 0.55 or 55%. \n\nTo calculate his total matches won another way, you can take this 55% overall win rate and multiply it by the total matches played (200). 0.55 * 200 = 110, again confirming he won 110 matches total, not 120.\n\nTherefore, while Sam did improve his win rate for his second 100 matches, his overall win rate across all 200 matches is 55%, corresponding to 110 total matches won, not 60% or 120 total matches won. The correct answer is (B) 110 matches won, not (A) 120 matches won.",
