Jace drives for a total of 13 hours - 4 hours initially, then takes a 30 minute break during which he is not driving, and finally drives for another 9 hours straight. Since he drives at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, we can calculate the total distance traveled by multiplying his speed by the total time spent driving: \n60 miles/hour * 13 hours = 780 miles total\n\nThe 30 minute break should not be included in the calculation, as no distance is being traveled during that time.",
