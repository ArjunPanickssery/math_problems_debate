There are 8 pints in a gallon, so 4.5 gallons is equal to 4.5 * 8 = 36 pints of coffee total.\n\nThis coffee was divided among 18 thermoses, so each thermos contained 36 pints / 18 thermoses = 2 pints of coffee.\n\nSince Genevieve drank 3 thermoses worth of coffee, she consumed 3 * 2 pints per thermos = 6 pints of coffee in total.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Genevieve drank 6 pints of coffee.",
