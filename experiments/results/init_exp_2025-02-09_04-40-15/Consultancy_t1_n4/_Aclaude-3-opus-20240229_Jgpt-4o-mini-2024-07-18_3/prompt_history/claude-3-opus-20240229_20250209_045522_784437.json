How many of his students got a final grade of B and above if he has 60 students in Grade 5?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 36.0\nSince 40% of his students got below B, 100% - 40% = 60% of Mr. Sanchez's students got B and above.\nThus, 60 x 60/100 = 36 students got B and above in their final grade.\n#### 36\n(B): 24.0\n40% of Mr. Sanchez's students are relevant to our calculation of B and above grades.\nTherefore, 60 \u00d7 40/100 = 24 students got B and above in their final grade.\n#### 24\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 36.0\nSince 40% of his students got below B, 100% - 40% = 60% of Mr. Sanchez's students got B and above.\nThus, 60 x 60/100 = 36 students got B and above in their final grade.\n#### 36"

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 36 students got a final grade of B and above. Here's why:\n\nWe know that 40% of Mr. Sanchez's 60 Grade 5 students got below a B. This means the remaining percentage - 60% - must have gotten a B or higher. To calculate how many students that 60% represents, we multiply the total number of students by 60%:\n\n60 students * 60% = 60 * 0.6 = 36 students\n\nTherefore, 36 out of Mr. Sanchez's 60 Grade 5 students achieved a final grade of B or above. The key is recognizing that the percentage getting B and above is the complement of the 40% getting below B.",
