      "content": "QUESTION: Lee had $10 and his friend had $8. They went to a restaurant where they ordered chicken wings for $6 and a chicken salad for $4. They also got 2 sodas for $1.00 each. The tax came to $3. How much change should they have received in total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 3.0\nLee and his friend had a total of $10 + $8 = $18.\nThe cost of the food was $6 + $4 + $1 + $1 = $12.\nThe total cost, including tax was $12 + $3 = $15.\nThey should have received $18 - $15 = $3 in total.\n#### 3\n(B): 4.0\nLee and friend pooled $10 + $8 = $18.\nThe cost of items was $6 + $4 + $1 = $11.\nTotal with tax was $11 + $3 = $14.\nThey should receive $18 - $14 = $4 in change.\n#### 4\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo determine the total change Lee and his friend should receive, we need to calculate the total amount they had and subtract the total cost of their meal, including tax.\n\nLee had $10 and his friend had $8, so together they had a total of $18. \n\nThe chicken wings cost $6 and the chicken salad was $4, which sums to $10. They also ordered 2 sodas at $1 each, adding $2 to the bill. So the total cost of the food items was $6 + $4 + $2 = $12.\n\nThe tax on the meal was $3. Adding this to the $12 food total, the final bill comes to $12 + $3 = $15.\n\nSince Lee and his friend had $18 total, and the final bill was $15, they should receive $18 - $15 = $3 in change.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Lee and his friend should receive $3 in total change.\n"
