Since Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina and Mabel has 85 marbles total, Katrina must have 85 \u00f7 5 = 17 marbles.\n\nNext, we know that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many as Katrina. Twice Katrina's marbles is 17 \u00d7 2 = 34. So Amanda currently has 34 - 12 = 22 marbles.\n\nFinally, since Mabel has 85 marbles and Amanda has 22, Mabel has 85 - 22 = 63 more marbles than Amanda.",
