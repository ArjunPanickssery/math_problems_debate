      "content": "QUESTION: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 828.0\nA single watermelon would sell for $2 x 23 = $46\n60 watermelons would sell for $46 x 18 = $828\n#### 828\n(B): 1656\nSince these are $2 per pound watermelons, first calculate the base price:\n$2 x 23 = $46 per watermelon\nFor 18 watermelons: $46 x 18 = $828\nFinally, account for the per-pound pricing: $828 x 2 = $1656\n#### 1656\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo calculate the total revenue from selling 18 watermelons, we first need to determine the price of each watermelon. Since Farmer Kent charges $2 per pound and each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, the price per watermelon is $2 x 23 = $46.\n\nNext, we calculate the revenue from selling 18 watermelons at $46 each: $46 x 18 = $828.\n\nHowever, since the watermelons are priced per pound, we need to account for this in our final calculation. The total weight of the 18 watermelons is 23 pounds x 18 = 414 pounds. At $2 per pound, the total revenue is $828 x 2 = $1656.\n"
