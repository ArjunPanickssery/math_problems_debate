      "content": "QUESTION: Ali and Sara ate 80 small apples combined. Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara. How many apples did Sara eat?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 16.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: A = 4S\nWhich means: 4S + S = 80\nSo: 5S = 80\nSo the number of apples Sara ate is: S = 80 / 5= 16 apples\n#### 16\n(A): 64.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: S = 4A\nWhich means: A + 4A = 80\nSo: 5A = 80\nTherefore: A = 16\nAnd finally: S = 4A = 4 \u00d7 16 = 64 apples\n#### 64\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo determine how many apples Sara ate, let's define variables:\nLet A = number of apples Ali ate\nLet S = number of apples Sara ate\n\nWe know two key pieces of information:\n1. Ali and Sara ate a total of 80 apples combined. Mathematically: A + S = 80\n2. Ali ate 4 times as many apples as Sara. Mathematically: A = 4S\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first:\n4S + S = 80\n5S = 80\n\nSolving for S:\nS = 80 / 5 = 16\n\nTherefore, Sara ate 16 apples. The given solution is correct.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the relationship between the number of apples Ali ate and the number of apples Sara ate?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 16.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: A = 4S\nWhich means: 4S + S = 80\nSo: 5S = 80\nSo the number of apples Sara ate is: S = 80 / 5= 16 apples\n#### 16"

          "content": "According to the problem statement, Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara. This means there is a direct relationship between the number of apples Ali ate (A) and the number Sara ate (S):\n\nA = 4S\n\nIn other words, if we know how many apples Sara ate, we can easily calculate how many Ali ate by multiplying Sara's amount by 4.\n\nFor example, if Sara ate 16 apples as determined in the solution, then Ali must have eaten:\nA = 4S = 4 * 16 = 64 apples\n\nSo the key relationship is that Ali's apple consumption is always 4 times Sara's, which allows us to set up the equations and solve for Sara's amount of 16 apples.",
