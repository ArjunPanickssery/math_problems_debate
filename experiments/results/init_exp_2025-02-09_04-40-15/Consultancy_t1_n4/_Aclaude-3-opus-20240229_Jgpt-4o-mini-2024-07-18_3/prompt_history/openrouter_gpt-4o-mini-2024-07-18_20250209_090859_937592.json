      "content": "QUESTION: Twenty years ago, Shane was 2 times older than Garret is now. If Garret is currently 12, how old is Shane now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 44.0\nTwenty years ago, Shane was 12 * 2 = 24 years old\nShane is currently 24 + 20 = 44 years old\n#### 44\n(A): 64.0\nFirst, we know Shane was 2 times Garret's current age of 12\nSo Shane was 12 * 2 = 24\nThen we need to account for the twenty year difference twice\nAdding 20 years for Shane and 20 years for the time difference\nSo Shane is currently 24 + 40 = 64 years old\n#### 64\n## Argument in favour of A\nI understand the confusion, but we only need to account for the 20 year time difference once, not twice. 20 years ago, Shane was twice Garret's current age of 12, so Shane was 24 at that time. To find Shane's current age, we simply add 20 years to his age from 20 years ago. 24 + 20 = 44. Therefore, Shane is currently 44 years old, not 64.\n"
