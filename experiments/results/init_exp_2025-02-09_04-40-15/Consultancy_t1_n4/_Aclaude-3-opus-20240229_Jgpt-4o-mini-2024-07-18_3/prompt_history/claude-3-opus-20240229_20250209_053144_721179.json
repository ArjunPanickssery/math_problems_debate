This means the number of hens can be expressed as 9x+5. \n\nSince the total number of chickens is 75, we can set up the equation:\nNumber of hens + Number of roosters = Total chickens\n(9x+5) + x = 75\n\nSimplifying:\n10x + 5 = 75\n10x = 70\nx = 7\n\nSo there are 7 roosters. Plugging this back into the expression for the number of hens:\nNumber of hens = 9(7) + 5 = 68\n\nTherefore, there are 68 hens on the farm.",
