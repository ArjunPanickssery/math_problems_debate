      "content": "QUESTION: Bush and Matt are brothers. Bush is younger than Matt by 3 years. This year Bush will be 12 years old. What will be Matt's age 10 years from now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 25.0\nBush is younger than Matt by 3 years, so if Bush is 12 years old then Matt is 12+3 = 15 years old\nIn 10 years' time, Matt will be 10+15 = 25 years old\n#### 25\n(B): 28.0\nBush is 12, Matt is 3 years older, so Matt is 12+3 = 15\nSince Matt will always be 3 years older, we add 3 again: 15+3 = 18\nIn 10 years' time, Matt will be 18+10 = 28\n#### 28\n## Argument in favour of A\nYou're absolutely right that Matt is currently 15 years old, since Bush is 12 and Matt is 3 years older. \n\nTo determine Matt's age 10 years from now, we simply need to add 10 to his current age of 15. \n\n15 + 10 = 25\n\nTherefore, in 10 years, when Bush is 22, Matt will be 25 years old. The age difference between them will always remain constant at 3 years.\n"
