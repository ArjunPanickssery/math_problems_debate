      "content": "QUESTION: A farmer gets 20 pounds of bacon on average from a pig. He sells each pound for $6 at the monthly farmer\u2019s market. This month\u2019s pig is a runt that grew to only half the size of the average pig. How many dollars will the farmer make from the pig\u2019s bacon?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nThe pig grew to half the size of the average pig, so it will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nThe rancher will make 10 * 6 = $60 from the pig\u2019s bacon.\n#### 60\n(A): 30.0\nThe pig will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nEach pound will sell for 6 / 2 = $3.\nThe farmer will make 10 * 3 = $30 from the pig's bacon.\n#### 30\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe answer is indeed $60. The key points are:\n\n1) The pig is half the size of an average pig. Since an average pig produces 20 pounds of bacon, this runt pig will produce half that amount, which is 10 pounds of bacon.\n\n2) The farmer sells each pound of bacon for $6. This price per pound does not change based on the size of the pig. \n\n3) With 10 pounds of bacon at $6 per pound, the total revenue will be 10 * $6 = $60.\n\nThe size of the pig impacts the quantity of bacon, but not the price per pound that the bacon is sold for. Therefore, the farmer will make $60 from this runt pig's bacon.\n"
