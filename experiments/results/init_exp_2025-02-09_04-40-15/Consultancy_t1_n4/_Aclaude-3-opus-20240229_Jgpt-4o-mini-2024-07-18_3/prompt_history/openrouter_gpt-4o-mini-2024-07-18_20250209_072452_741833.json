      "content": "QUESTION: 4.5 gallons of coffee were divided among 18 thermoses. Genevieve drank 3 thermoses. How many pints of coffee did Genevieve drink?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 6.0\n4.5 gallons = 4.5 * 8 pints = 36 pints\n36/18 = 2 pints\nGenevieve drank 2*3=6 pints of coffee.\n#### 6\n(A): 3.0\n4.5 gallons = 4.5 * 4 pints = 18 pints\n18/18 = 1 pint per thermos\nGenevieve drank 1*3 = 3 pints of coffee.\n#### 3\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo determine how many pints of coffee Genevieve drank, we first need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so 4.5 gallons is equal to 4.5 * 8 = 36 pints of coffee total.\n\nThis coffee was divided among 18 thermoses, so each thermos contained 36 pints / 18 thermoses = 2 pints of coffee.\n\nSince Genevieve drank 3 thermoses worth of coffee, she consumed 3 * 2 pints per thermos = 6 pints of coffee in total.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Genevieve drank 6 pints of coffee.\n"
