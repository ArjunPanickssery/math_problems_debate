      "content": "QUESTION: Kylie and Kayla pick apples together and take home 340 apples total. If Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked, how many apples did Kayla pick?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 274.0\nLet x be the number of apples Kylie picked\nKayla picked 10+4x apples\n340=x+(10+4x)\n340=5x+10\n330=5x\nx=66 apples\nKayla picked 10+4(66)=274 apples\n#### 274\n(B): 280\nLet x be the number of apples Kylie picked\nKayla picked 4(x+10) apples\n340=x+4(x+10)\n340=x+4x+40\n340=5x+40\n300=5x\nx=60 apples\nKayla picked 4(60+10)=4(70)=280 apples\n#### 280\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo find the number of apples Kayla picked, let's define a variable for Kylie's apples. Let x be the number Kylie picked. The question states Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times Kylie's amount. So Kayla picked 4x + 10 apples. Together they picked 340 apples total. We can write an equation: x + (4x + 10) = 340. Simplifying, 5x + 10 = 340. Subtracting 10 from both sides gives 5x = 330. Dividing by 5 yields x = 66. So Kylie picked 66 apples. Plugging this back in, Kayla picked 4(66) + 10 = 274 apples.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the relationship between the number of apples picked by Kylie and Kayla according to the problem statement? \n\nCan you confirm the total number of apples picked by both Kylie and Kayla? \n\nHow do you interpret the phrase \"Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked\"? \n\nCan you explain the mathematical equations used to derive the number of apples each person picked? \n\nIs there any ambiguity in the problem that could lead to different interpretations of the equations? \n\nWhat is the significance of the numbers 66 and 274 in the context of the problem? \n\nHow do the two proposed solutions differ in their approach to solving the problem? \n\nWhich method do you think is more reliable based on the problem's wording? \n\nCan you provide any insights into common mistakes made when interpreting similar problems? \n\nIs there a way to verify the correctness of the calculations for both answers?\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe problem states that Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the amount of apples Kylie picked. This means if Kylie picked x apples, Kayla picked 4x + 10 apples. The total of 340 apples picked by both is clearly stated.\n\nThe equation x + (4x + 10) = 340 directly translates the problem statement. It says the sum of Kylie's apples (x) and Kayla's apples (4x + 10) equals the total of 340. Solving this equation step-by-step leads to x = 66, meaning Kylie picked 66 apples. Substituting this back gives Kayla picking 4(66) + 10 = 274 apples.\n\nThe wording is unambiguous. \"10 more than 4 times\" clearly means multiplying Kylie's amount by 4 and adding 10. The other interpretation incorrectly applies the \"10 more\" separately.\n\n66 is the number of apples Kylie picked, and 274 is the number Kayla picked, according to the correct equations. \n\nThe proposed solution (A) directly translates the problem statement into an equation and solves it step-by-step. Solution (B) misinterprets the phrasing and gets a different equation.\n\nBased on the precise wording, method (A) reliably represents the problem mathematically. The calculations for (A) can be easily verified by plugging the values back into the original equation.\n"
