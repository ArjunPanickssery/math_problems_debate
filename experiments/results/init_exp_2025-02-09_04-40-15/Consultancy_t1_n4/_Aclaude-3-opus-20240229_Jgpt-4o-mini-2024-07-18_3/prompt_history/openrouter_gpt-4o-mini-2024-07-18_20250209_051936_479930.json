      "content": "QUESTION: On each of 7 Mondays, it rained 1.5 centimeters. On each of 9 Tuesdays it rained 2.5 centimeters. How many more centimeters did it rain on Tuesdays than Mondays?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 12.0\nMondays: 7 * 1.5 = 10.5\nTuesdays: 9 * 2.5 = 22.5\n22.5 - 10.5 = 12 cm\nIt rained 12 centimeters more on Tuesdays than on Mondays.\n#### 12\n(B): 9.0\nLet's find the difference per day: 2.5 - 1.5 = 1\nSince there were 9 Tuesdays, multiply by 9\n1 * 9 = 9\nTherefore, it rained 9 centimeters more on Tuesdays than Mondays.\n#### 9\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo determine how many more centimeters it rained on Tuesdays than Mondays, we need to calculate the total rainfall for each day of the week and then find the difference.\n\nOn Mondays, it rained 1.5 cm each day for 7 days. So the total rainfall on Mondays was:\n7 * 1.5 cm = 10.5 cm\n\nOn Tuesdays, it rained 2.5 cm each day for 9 days. The total rainfall on Tuesdays was: \n9 * 2.5 cm = 22.5 cm\n\nTo find the difference, we subtract the total Monday rainfall from the total Tuesday rainfall:\n22.5 cm - 10.5 cm = 12 cm\n\nTherefore, it rained 12 centimeters more in total on Tuesdays compared to Mondays over the given period.\n"
