          "content": "The key to solving this problem is realizing that Henry and his brother are each eating 1 apple per day. With 42 total apples and 2 people eating 1 apple each daily, the apples will last half as long as if only 1 person was eating them.\n\nIf Henry was eating the 42 apples alone at a rate of 1 per day, they would indeed last 42 days, or 6 weeks. But since he is sharing them equally with his brother, with each consuming 1 apple a day, the duration the apples last gets divided by 2. \n\nTherefore, the 42 apples will last Henry and his brother 42/2 = 21 days, which is equivalent to 21/7 = 3 weeks.",
