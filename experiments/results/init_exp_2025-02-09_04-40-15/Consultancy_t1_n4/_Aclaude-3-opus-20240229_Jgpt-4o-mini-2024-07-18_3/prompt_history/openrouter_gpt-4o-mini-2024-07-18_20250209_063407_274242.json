      "content": "QUESTION: There are 14 red crayons, 5 more blue crayons than red crayons, and 6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons.  How many yellow crayons are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 32.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:5+14=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)-6=32 crayons\n#### 32\n(A): 44.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:14+5=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)+6=44 crayons\n#### 44\n## Argument in favour of A\nHere is my argument for why the correct answer is (A) 44 yellow crayons:\n\nWe are told there are 14 red crayons. There are 5 more blue crayons than red crayons. Since there are 14 red crayons, to calculate the number of blue crayons we take 14 and add 5, which equals 19 blue crayons.\n\nNext, we are told there are 6 less yellow crayons than double the number of blue crayons. We calculated there are 19 blue crayons. To double that, we multiply 19 by 2 which equals 38. Since there are 6 less yellow crayons than that, we take 38 and add 6 to get the total number of yellow crayons, which is 44.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of yellow crayons is 44, so (A) is the right answer.\n"
