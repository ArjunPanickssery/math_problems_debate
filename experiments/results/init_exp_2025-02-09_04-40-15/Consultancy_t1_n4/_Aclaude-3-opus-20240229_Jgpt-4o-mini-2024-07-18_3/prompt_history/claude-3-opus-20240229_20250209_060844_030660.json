          "content": "To calculate the cost to paint the 20 ft by 15 ft mural, we first need to determine the total area, which is 20 * 15 = 300 square feet. Given that it takes James 20 minutes to paint each square foot, the total time required is 300 * 20 = 6000 minutes. Converting this to hours, we get 6000 / 60 = 100 hours. Since James charges $150 per hour, the total cost for painting the mural is 100 * 150 = $15,000. Therefore, the correct answer is (A): $15,000.",
