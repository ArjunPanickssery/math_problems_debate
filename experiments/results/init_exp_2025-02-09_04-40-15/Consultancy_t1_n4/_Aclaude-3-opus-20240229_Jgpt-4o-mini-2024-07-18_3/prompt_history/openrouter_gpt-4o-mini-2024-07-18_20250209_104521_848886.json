      "content": "QUESTION: Belle eats 4 dog biscuits and 2 rawhide bones every evening. If each rawhide bone is $1, and each dog biscuit is $0.25, then how much does it cost, in dollars, to feed Belle these treats for a week?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 21.0\nA week's worth of rawhide bones cost 1*2*7=14 dollars.\nA week's worth of dog biscuits cost 0.25*4*7=7 dollars,\nThus, in total, it cost 14+7=21 dollars\n#### 21\n(A): 31.50\nThe rawhide bones cost 4*1*7=28 dollars.\nThe dog biscuits cost 2*0.25*7=3.50 dollars.\nThus, in total, it costs 28+3.50=31.50 dollars\n#### 31.50\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo calculate the cost of feeding Belle her treats for a week, we need to determine the daily cost and multiply it by 7 days.\n\nEach evening, Belle eats:\n- 4 dog biscuits at $0.25 each: 4 * $0.25 = $1\n- 2 rawhide bones at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2\n\nThe total daily cost is $1 + $2 = $3\n\nOver a week (7 days), the total cost would be:\n7 * $3 = $21\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B): $21.0.\n"
