      "content": "QUESTION: For every one dozen flowers bought, a customer gets 2 free flowers. If Maria wants to buy 3 dozens flowers, how many pieces of flowers will she have in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 42.0\nMaria has 3 x 2 = 6 free flowers from buying 3 dozens flowers.\nSince each dozen is equal to 12, then Maria bought 3 x 12 = 36 flowers.\nHence, she has a total of 36 + 6 = 42 flowers.\n#### 42\n(B): 44.0\nFirst calculating the regular flowers: 3 x 12 = 36 flowers\nAdding the free flowers for each dozen: 36 + (3 x 2) = 42 flowers\nAdding the free flowers for the total purchase: 42 + 2 = 44 flowers\n#### 44\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo calculate the total number of flowers Maria will have:\n\n1. Maria is buying 3 dozen flowers. Each dozen contains 12 flowers.\n   * Number of flowers bought = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 flowers\n\n2. For every dozen (12 flowers) bought, Maria gets 2 free flowers. Since she is buying 3 dozen:\n   * Number of free flowers = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 flowers\n\n3. The total number of flowers is the sum of the flowers bought and the free flowers received:\n   * Total flowers = Flowers bought + Free flowers\n   * Total flowers = 36 + 6 = 42 flowers\n\nTherefore, Maria will have a total of 42 flowers after buying 3 dozen and receiving the promotional free flowers.\n"
