          "content": "To determine the length of Kate's hair, we first need to find the length of Emily's hair based on the information provided about Logan's hair length.\n\nWe know that Logan's hair is 20 inches long, and Emily's hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's. Therefore, to calculate Emily's hair length, we add 6 inches to Logan's hair length:\n\nEmily's hair length = Logan's hair length + 6 inches\nEmily's hair length = 20 inches + 6 inches = 26 inches\n\nNow that we have Emily's hair length, we can calculate Kate's hair length. The question states that Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's hair. To find half of Emily's hair length, we divide it by 2:\n\nKate's hair length = Emily's hair length \u00f7 2\nKate's hair length = 26 inches \u00f7 2 = 13 inches\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A): Kate's hair is 13 inches long.",
