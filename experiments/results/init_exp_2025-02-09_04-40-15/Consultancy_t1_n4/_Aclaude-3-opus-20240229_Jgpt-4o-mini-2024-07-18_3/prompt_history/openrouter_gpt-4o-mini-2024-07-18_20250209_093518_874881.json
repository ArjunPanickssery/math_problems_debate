      "content": "QUESTION: Scott has 7 pairs of shoes.  Anthony has 3 times as many pairs of shoes as Scott, and Jim has 2 less pairs than Anthony.  How many more pairs of shoes does Anthony have compared to Jim?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2.0\nAnthony:7(3)=21\nJim:21-2=19\nAnthony has 21-19=2 more pairs of shoes.\n#### 2\n(B): 6.0\nAnthony:7(3)=21\nJim:5(3)=15\nAnthony has 21-15=6 more pairs of shoes.\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of A\nHere is my argument for why answer (A) is correct:\n\nAnthony has 3 times as many pairs of shoes as Scott. Since Scott has 7 pairs, we can calculate that Anthony has 7 * 3 = 21 pairs of shoes.\n\nThe question states that Jim has 2 less pairs of shoes than Anthony. Since Anthony has 21 pairs, Jim must have 21 - 2 = 19 pairs of shoes. \n\nTo determine how many more pairs of shoes Anthony has compared to Jim, we simply subtract:\nAnthony's pairs (21) - Jim's pairs (19) = 2\n\nTherefore, Anthony has 2 more pairs of shoes than Jim, so answer choice (A) 2.0 is correct.\n"
