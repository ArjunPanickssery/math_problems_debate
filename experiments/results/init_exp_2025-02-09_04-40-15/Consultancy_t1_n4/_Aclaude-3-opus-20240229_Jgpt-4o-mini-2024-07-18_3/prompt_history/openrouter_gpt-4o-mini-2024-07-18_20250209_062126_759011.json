      "content": "QUESTION: A thirsty traveler found an oasis in the desert. He drank 32 ounces of water. His camel drank seven times as much as he did. There are 128 ounces in a gallon. How many gallons of water did they drink altogether?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 2.0\nThe traveler\u2019s camel drank 7 * 32 = 224 ounces of water.\nTogether, the traveler and his camel drank 32 + 224 = 256 ounces.\nThus, they drank 256 / 128 = 2 gallons of water altogether.\n#### 2\n(A): 2.75\nThe traveler drank 32 ounces, which equals 32/128 = 0.25 gallons\nThe camel drank seven times this amount: 0.25 * 7 = 1.75 gallons\nTotal water consumed: 0.25 + 1.75 = 2.75 gallons\n#### 2.75\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo determine the total gallons of water consumed, we first calculate how much the camel drank. The camel drank 7 times as much as the traveler, who consumed 32 ounces. So the camel drank 7 * 32 = 224 ounces.\n\nNext, we add the traveler's consumption to the camel's:\n32 ounces (traveler) + 224 ounces (camel) = 256 ounces total\n\nFinally, we convert the total ounces to gallons. There are 128 ounces in a gallon, so we divide the total ounces by 128:\n\n256 ounces / 128 ounces per gallon = 2 gallons\n\nTherefore, the traveler and his camel drank a total of 2 gallons of water.\n"
