Since Scott has 7 pairs, we can calculate that Anthony has 7 * 3 = 21 pairs of shoes.\n\nThe question states that Jim has 2 less pairs of shoes than Anthony. Since Anthony has 21 pairs, Jim must have 21 - 2 = 19 pairs of shoes. \n\nTo determine how many more pairs of shoes Anthony has compared to Jim, we simply subtract:\nAnthony's pairs (21) - Jim's pairs (19) = 2\n\nTherefore, Anthony has 2 more pairs of shoes than Jim, so answer choice (A) 2.0 is correct.",
