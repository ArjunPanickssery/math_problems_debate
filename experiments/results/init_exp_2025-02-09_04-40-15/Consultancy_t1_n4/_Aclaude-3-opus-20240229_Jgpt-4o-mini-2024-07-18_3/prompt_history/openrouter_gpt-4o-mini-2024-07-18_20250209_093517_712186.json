      "content": "QUESTION: Carol sells tickets for an exhibition. During three days she sold tickets worth $960. One ticket costs $4. How many tickets on average did she sell during one of these three days?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 80.0\nCarol sold 960 / 4 = 240 tickets during three days.\nSo in one day, she sold on average 240 / 3 = 80 tickets.\n#### 80\n(A): 1280\nFirst divide the total money by days to get daily revenue\n$960 / 3 = $320 per day\nThen since each ticket is $4, that means she sold 320 \u00d7 4 = 1280 tickets per day\n#### 1280\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo calculate the average number of tickets Carol sold per day, we first need to find the total revenue earned over the three days, which is $960. By dividing this total revenue by the number of days (3), we get the average daily revenue:\n\n$960 / 3 days = $320 per day\n\nNow, since each ticket costs $4, we can determine the average number of tickets sold per day by dividing the average daily revenue by the cost per ticket:\n\n$320 per day / $4 per ticket = 80 tickets per day\n\nTherefore, on average, Carol sold 80 tickets per day during the three-day exhibition.\n"
