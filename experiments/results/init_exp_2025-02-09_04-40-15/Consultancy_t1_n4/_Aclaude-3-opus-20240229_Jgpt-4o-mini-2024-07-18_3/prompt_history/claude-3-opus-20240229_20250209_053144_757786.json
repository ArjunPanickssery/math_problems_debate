How far does he move horizontally, in feet?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2700.0\nHe travels 1450-100=1350 feet vertically\nSo he travels 1350*2=2700 feet horizontally\n#### 2700\n(B): 2900.0\nHe reaches an elevation of 1450 feet\nSince he moves 2 feet horizontally for each vertical foot, he travels 1450*2=2900 feet horizontally\n#### 2900\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 2900.0\nHe reaches an elevation of 1450 feet\nSince he moves 2 feet horizontally for each vertical foot, he travels 1450*2=2900 feet horizontally\n#### 2900"
