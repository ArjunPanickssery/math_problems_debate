          "content": "To determine the total change Lee and his friend should receive, we need to calculate the total amount they had and subtract the total cost of their meal, including tax.\n\nLee had $10 and his friend had $8, so together they had a total of $18. \n\nThe chicken wings cost $6 and the chicken salad was $4, which sums to $10. They also ordered 2 sodas at $1 each, adding $2 to the bill. So the total cost of the food items was $6 + $4 + $2 = $12.\n\nThe tax on the meal was $3. Adding this to the $12 food total, the final bill comes to $12 + $3 = $15.\n\nSince Lee and his friend had $18 total, and the final bill was $15, they should receive $18 - $15 = $3 in change.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Lee and his friend should receive $3 in total change.",
