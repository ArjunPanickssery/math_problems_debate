      "content": "QUESTION: Maria bought a ticket to a ZOO. The regular price stands at $15, but she was able to get a 40% discount. How much did Maria pay for the ticket?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 9.0\nThe discount Maria got was 40/100 * 15 = $6.\nThat means the price for her ticket was 15 - 6 = $9.\n#### 9\n(B): 6.0\nA 40% discount means the price is 40/100 of the original amount.\n40/100 * 15 = $6\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo calculate the price Maria paid for the ZOO ticket, we first need to determine the discount amount. The regular ticket price is $15, and Maria received a 40% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the regular price by the discount percentage: $15 * 0.40 = $6. This means that the discount is $6.\n\nNow, to find the price Maria actually paid, we subtract the discount amount from the regular ticket price: $15 - $6 = $9. Therefore, Maria paid $9 for her ZOO ticket after applying the 40% discount.\n"
