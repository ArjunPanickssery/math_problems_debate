      "content": "QUESTION: A farm has 5 less than 9 times the amount of hens as roosters.  If there are 75 total chickens, how many hens are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 67.0\nLet x represent the number of roosters\nNumber of hens:9x-5\nTotal:9x-5+x=75\n10x-5=75\n10x=80\nx=8\nNumber of hens: 9(8)-5=67\n#### 67\n(B): 68.0\nLet x represent the number of roosters\nNumber of hens: 9x+5\nTotal: 9x+5+x=75\n10x+5=75\n10x=70\nx=7\nNumber of hens: 9(7)+5=68\n#### 68\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo find the number of hens, let's represent the number of roosters as x. The problem states that the farm has 5 less than 9 times the amount of hens as roosters. This means the number of hens can be expressed as 9x+5. \n\nSince the total number of chickens is 75, we can set up the equation:\nNumber of hens + Number of roosters = Total chickens\n(9x+5) + x = 75\n\nSimplifying:\n10x + 5 = 75\n10x = 70\nx = 7\n\nSo there are 7 roosters. Plugging this back into the expression for the number of hens:\nNumber of hens = 9(7) + 5 = 68\n\nTherefore, there are 68 hens on the farm.\n"
