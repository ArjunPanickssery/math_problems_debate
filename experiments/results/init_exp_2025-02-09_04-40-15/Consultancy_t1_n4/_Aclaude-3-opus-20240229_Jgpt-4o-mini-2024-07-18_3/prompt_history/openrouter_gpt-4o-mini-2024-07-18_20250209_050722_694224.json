      "content": "QUESTION: Peter has 20 books. He has read 40% of them. His brother has read 10% of them. How many more of these books has Peter read than his brother?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 6.0\nPeter has read 8 of these books because 20 x .4 = 8\nHis brother has read 2 of these books because 20 x .1 = 2\nPeter has read 6 more books than his brother because 8 - 2 = 6\n#### 6\n(B): 120\nPeter has read 8 of these books because 20 x .4 = 8\nHis brother has read 2 of these books because 20 x .1 = 2\nThe difference of 6 books needs to be scaled by the total collection size of 20 books to get the final answer: 6 x 20 = 120\n#### 120\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct answer is (A): 6.0. Here's why:\n\nPeter has read 40% of the 20 books. To calculate how many books that is, we multiply 20 by 0.4, which equals 8 books.\n\nPeter's brother has read 10% of the 20 books. 10% of 20 is found by multiplying 20 by 0.1, which equals 2 books.\n\nTo determine how many more books Peter has read compared to his brother, we simply subtract the number of books his brother read from the number Peter read: 8 - 2 = 6.\n\nTherefore, Peter has read 6 more books than his brother. The question is asking for the absolute difference in number of books read, not a scaled difference.\n"
