      "content": "QUESTION: A housewife goes to the market. She spent 2/3 of her $150. How much does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50\n(A): 100.0\nFirst calculate what fraction remains: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\nSince 2/3 was spent, multiply $150 by 2/3: $150 * (2/3) = $100\nThis is the amount she has left.\n#### 100\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo determine how much money the housewife has left, we need to find the fraction of her original $150 that remains unspent. She spent 2/3 of her money, so the fraction remaining is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. This means 1/3 of the original $150 is left.\n\nTo calculate 1/3 of $150, we multiply:\n$150 * (1/3) = $50\n\nTherefore, the housewife has $50 remaining after spending 2/3 of her original $150 at the market.\n"
