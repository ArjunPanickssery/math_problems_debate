      "content": "QUESTION: Sam has 18 cows.  5 more than half the cows are black.  How many cows are not black?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 4.0\nHalf of the cows: 18/2=9\nBlack cows: 5+9=14\n18-14=4 cows\n#### 4\n(B): 6\nTotal cows plus 5: 18+5 = 23\nHalf of 23 (rounded): 12\nThese are black cows\nNon-black cows: 18-12 = 6\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo determine how many of Sam's cows are not black, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. Sam has a total of 18 cows.\n2. We're told that 5 more than half the cows are black. \n3. To find half the cows, we divide the total number of cows (18) by 2, which equals 9.\n4. Since 5 more than half the cows are black, we add 5 to the half (9), giving us 14 black cows.\n5. To find the non-black cows, we subtract the black cows (14) from the total cows (18).\n6. 18 - 14 = 4\n\nTherefore, 4 of Sam's cows are not black.\n"

Does it mean to add 5 to the number of cows that are half, or does it imply something different? \n\nCan you clarify how to calculate half of the total number of cows correctly in this context? \n\nWhat would you say is the correct method to determine the number of black cows based on the information given? \n\nIs there any possibility that the total number of cows could change based on the phrasing of the question? \n\nHow do you suggest verifying the number of non-black cows after calculating the black cows?",
