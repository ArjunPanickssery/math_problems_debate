How far does he move horizontally, in feet?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2700.0\nHe travels 1450-100=1350 feet vertically\nSo he travels 1350*2=2700 feet horizontally\n#### 2700\n(B): 2900.0\nHe reaches an elevation of 1450 feet\nSince he moves 2 feet horizontally for each vertical foot, he travels 1450*2=2900 feet horizontally\n#### 2900\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 2900.0\nHe reaches an elevation of 1450 feet\nSince he moves 2 feet horizontally for each vertical foot, he travels 1450*2=2900 feet horizontally\n#### 2900"

John starts at 100 feet and climbs to 1450 feet, which means a total vertical climb of 1350 feet. Since the problem states he travels 2 feet horizontally for every 1 foot vertically, we multiply the vertical distance by 2.\n\n1350 feet (vertical) \u00d7 2 = 2900 feet (horizontal)\n\nThis calculation directly matches the reasoning in answer choice (B), demonstrating why 2900 feet is the correct horizontal distance traveled.",
