I will prepare my argument to convince the judge of this solution.\n\nIf the judge asks me to explain my reasoning, I will respond:\n\nThe key is understanding how we divide the total apples. We have 42 total apples (14 apples/box \u00d7 3 boxes), which must be shared between Henry and his brother. By splitting these 42 apples equally, each person gets 21 apples. Since they each eat 1 apple per day, and a week has 7 days, we calculate 21 apples \u00f7 7 days = 3 weeks. This precise division ensures they consume all apples evenly over exactly 3 weeks. The math is straightforward: total apples divided by people, then divided by days per week, yields 3 weeks of apple consumption.",
