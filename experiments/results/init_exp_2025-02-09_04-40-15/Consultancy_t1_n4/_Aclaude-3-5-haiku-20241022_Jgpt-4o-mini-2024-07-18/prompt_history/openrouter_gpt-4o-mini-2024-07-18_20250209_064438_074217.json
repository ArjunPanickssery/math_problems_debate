      "content": "QUESTION: Lee had $10 and his friend had $8. They went to a restaurant where they ordered chicken wings for $6 and a chicken salad for $4. They also got 2 sodas for $1.00 each. The tax came to $3. How much change should they have received in total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 3.0\nLee and his friend had a total of $10 + $8 = $18.\nThe cost of the food was $6 + $4 + $1 + $1 = $12.\nThe total cost, including tax was $12 + $3 = $15.\nThey should have received $18 - $15 = $3 in total.\n#### 3\n(B): 4.0\nLee and friend pooled $10 + $8 = $18.\nThe cost of items was $6 + $4 + $1 = $11.\nTotal with tax was $11 + $3 = $14.\nThey should receive $18 - $14 = $4 in change.\n#### 4\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, I will demonstrate why the answer of $3 in change is the most accurate solution to this problem.\n\nFirst, let's break down the total money they brought: Lee had $10 and his friend had $8, which sums to $18. This establishes their starting financial position.\n\nNext, let's calculate their expenses. The chicken wings cost $6, the chicken salad $4, and two sodas at $1 each totals $12 for food. Adding the $3 tax brings their total expenditure to $15.\n\nBy subtracting their total expenses ($15) from their initial pooled money ($18), they should receive exactly $3 in change. The math is precise and straightforward.\n\nWould Your Honor like me to elaborate on any part of this calculation?\n"
