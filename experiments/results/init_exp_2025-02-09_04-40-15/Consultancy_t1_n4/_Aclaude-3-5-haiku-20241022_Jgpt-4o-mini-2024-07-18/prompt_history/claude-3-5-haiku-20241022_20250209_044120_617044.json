          "content": "Your Honor, I will demonstrate why 56 slightly used crayons is the correct solution. \n\nFirst, let's break down the total crayon count: 120 crayons in the box. One-third are new, which calculates to 40 crayons. Then, 20% are broken, which is precisely 24 crayons. By directly subtracting these from the total (120 - 40 - 24), we arrive at 56 slightly used crayons. \n\nThis method provides a straightforward, step-by-step calculation that leaves no ambiguity. The arithmetic is clear and precise, showing 56 as the definitive number of slightly used crayons.",
