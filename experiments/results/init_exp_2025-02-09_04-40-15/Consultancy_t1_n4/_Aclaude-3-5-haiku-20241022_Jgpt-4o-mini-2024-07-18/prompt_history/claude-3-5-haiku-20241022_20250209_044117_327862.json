The squat rack costs $2500, and the barbell costs 1/10 of that price, which is $250. By simply adding these two amounts ($2500 + $250), Jack's total expenditure is $2750. This direct arithmetic approach provides a clear and logical path to the total cost, showing that Jack paid $2750 for everything.\n\nI'm prepared to defend this answer if the judge has any questions about the calculation or reasoning.",
