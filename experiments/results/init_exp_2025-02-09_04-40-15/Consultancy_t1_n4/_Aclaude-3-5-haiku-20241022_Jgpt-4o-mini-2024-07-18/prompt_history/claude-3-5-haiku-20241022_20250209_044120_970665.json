If the judge asks me any questions, I will respond strategically to convince them of this solution.\n\nMy key argument is that the problem follows a clear, consistent doubling pattern each month. Starting with $10 in January, Brianne doubles her savings each subsequent month:\n- January: $10\n- February: $10 \u00d7 2 = $20\n- March: $20 \u00d7 2 = $40\n- April: $40 \u00d7 2 = $80\n- May: $80 \u00d7 2 = $160\n\nThis systematic progression shows a straightforward multiplication approach, making $160 the logical and mathematically sound answer for May's savings.",
