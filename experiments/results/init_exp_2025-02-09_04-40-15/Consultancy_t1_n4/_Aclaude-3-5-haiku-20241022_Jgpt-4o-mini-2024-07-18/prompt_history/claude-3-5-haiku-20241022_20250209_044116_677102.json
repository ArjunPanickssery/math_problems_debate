Twenty years ago, Shane was twice Garret's current age. Garret is now 12, so twenty years ago, Shane was 24. But we must account for the full 20-year time span for both individuals. When we add 20 years to Shane's age from that point, plus another 20 years to bridge the time difference, we arrive precisely at 64 years old. This methodical approach ensures we capture every temporal nuance in the age calculation.",
