      "content": "QUESTION: Eddy\u2019s spider plant produces 2 baby plants 2 times a year.  After 4 years, how many baby plants will the mother plant have produced?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 16.0\nThe mother plant produces 2 baby plants 2 times a year so it produces 2*2 = 4 plants a year\nIt produces 4 plants a year so after 4 years it will produce 4*4 = 16 baby plants\n#### 16\n(B): 30.0\nThe mother plant produces 2 babies twice per year\nIn the first year we get 2 babies from the first time\nThen we add 2 more from the second time that year\nIn the second year we get 4 more total\nIn the third year we get 8 more total\nIn the fourth year we get 16 more total\nAdding all babies: 2 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30 baby plants\n#### 30\n## Argument in favour of A\nAs a consultant arguing for Answer A (16.0), I will present a clear and concise argument for why this is the correct solution.\n\nMy argument focuses on the straightforward multiplication of baby plant production:\n- The spider plant produces 2 baby plants twice per year\n- This means 4 baby plants are produced annually (2 \u00d7 2)\n- Over 4 years, the total baby plant production will be 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 baby plants\n\nThe calculation is simple and direct: 2 baby plants per occurrence, 2 occurrences yearly, multiplied by 4 years equals 16 total baby plants. This linear progression provides a clear, predictable count of the spider plant's reproductive output.\n\nThe method is mathematically sound and easy to understand, making 16 baby plants the most logical answer.\n"
