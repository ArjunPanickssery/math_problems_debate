      "content": "QUESTION: Laura bought 2 pairs of pants for $54 each and 4 shirts for $33 each. She gave $250 to the cashier. So how much change did she take?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 10.0\n54*2=$108 is the price of 2 pairs of pants.\n4*33=$132 is the price of 4 shirts.\n108+132=$240 is the total price.\nSo the cashier gave 250-240=$10 change to Laura.\n#### 10\n(A): -32\n33*2=$66 is the price of 2 pairs of pants\n4*54=$216 is the price of 4 shirts\n66+216=$282 is the total price\nSo 250-282=$-32 is the change\n#### -32\n## Argument in favour of B\nI will argue in favor of answer (B): 10.0\n\nYour Honor, Laura's purchase is straightforward. She bought 2 pants at $54 each, totaling $108, and 4 shirts at $33 each, totaling $132. When we add these together, the total purchase price is $240. She gave the cashier $250, which means her change is precisely $10. The arithmetic is clear and unambiguous: 250 - 240 = 10. This calculation demonstrates that Laura received $10 in change, making option (B) the correct solution.\n"
