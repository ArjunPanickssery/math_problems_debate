Then, Anthony's shoes are 3 times Scott's: 7 \u00d7 3 = 21 pairs. This establishes Anthony's total shoe count definitively.\n\nNext, we determine Jim's shoes by subtracting 2 from Anthony's total: 21 - 2 = 19 pairs. This shows Jim has fewer shoes than Anthony.\n\nThe key calculation is the difference between Anthony and Jim's shoes: 21 - 19 = 2 pairs. This precisely demonstrates that Anthony has 2 more pairs of shoes than Jim.\n\nThe arithmetic is straightforward and leaves no room for alternative interpretations.",
