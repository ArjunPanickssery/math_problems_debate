He reads exactly 100 pages on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday each week. By calculating the total pages read per week, we find he completes 300 pages weekly. When we divide the total book length of 2100 pages by his weekly reading rate, we arrive at exactly 7 reading segments. Since each week contains 7 days, this translates to precisely 3 weeks to finish the entire book. The mathematics are straightforward and demonstrate a clear, logical progression of his reading schedule.",
