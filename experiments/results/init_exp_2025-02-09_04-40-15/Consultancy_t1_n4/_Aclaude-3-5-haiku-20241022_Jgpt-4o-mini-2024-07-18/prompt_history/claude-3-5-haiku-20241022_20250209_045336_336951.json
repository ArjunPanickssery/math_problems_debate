Growth Calculation: John started at 66 inches and grew 2 inches per month for 3 months. This means a total gain of 2 * 3 = 6 inches. This is a simple, direct multiplication that's easy to verify.\n\n2. Height Progression: Adding his original height (66 inches) to his growth (6 inches) results in 72 inches. This is a clear, linear progression that anyone can follow.\n\n3. Conversion to Feet: 72 inches divided by 12 (inches per foot) equals exactly 6 feet. The math is clean and precise, leaving no room for complex interpretation.\n\nWould the judge like me to elaborate on any of these points?",
