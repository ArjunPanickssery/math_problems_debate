Stu has 9 books, so Albert's book count is straightforward: 4 * 9 = 36 books. When we add Stu's 9 books to Albert's 36 books, we get a total of 45 books. The calculation is direct and follows the problem's instructions precisely. Each step is logically connected, and the arithmetic is simple and unambiguous.",
