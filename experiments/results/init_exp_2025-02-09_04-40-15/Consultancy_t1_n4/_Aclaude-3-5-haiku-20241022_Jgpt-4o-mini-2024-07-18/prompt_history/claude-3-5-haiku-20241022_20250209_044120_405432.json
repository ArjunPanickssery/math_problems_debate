How many square inches of the box are left uncovered?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 8.0\nThe shoebox is 24 square inches because 4 x 6 = 24\nThe block is 16 square inches because 4 x 4 = 16\nThere are 8 square inches uncovered because 24 - 16 = 8\n#### 8\n(B): 4\nThe shoebox perimeter is 20 (4 + 6) \u00d7 2\nThe block perimeter is 16: 4 \u00d7 4\nThe uncovered space is 20 - 16\n#### 4\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 4\nThe shoebox perimeter is 20 (4 + 6) \u00d7 2\nThe block perimeter is 16: 4 \u00d7 4\nThe uncovered space is 20 - 16\n#### 4"

The shoebox's perimeter is calculated by adding the length and width, then multiplying by 2: (4 + 6) \u00d7 2 = 20 square inches. The block's perimeter is 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 square inches. By subtracting the block's perimeter from the shoebox's perimeter, we find 20 - 16 = 4 square inches of uncovered space. This method provides a precise measurement of the uncovered area.",
