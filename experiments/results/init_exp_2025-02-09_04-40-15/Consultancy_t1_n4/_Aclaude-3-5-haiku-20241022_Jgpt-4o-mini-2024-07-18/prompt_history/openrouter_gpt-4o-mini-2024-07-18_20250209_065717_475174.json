      "content": "QUESTION: Kylie and Kayla pick apples together and take home 340 apples total. If Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked, how many apples did Kayla pick?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 274.0\nLet x be the number of apples Kylie picked\nKayla picked 10+4x apples\n340=x+(10+4x)\n340=5x+10\n330=5x\nx=66 apples\nKayla picked 10+4(66)=274 apples\n#### 274\n(B): 280\nLet x be the number of apples Kylie picked\nKayla picked 4(x+10) apples\n340=x+4(x+10)\n340=x+4x+40\n340=5x+40\n300=5x\nx=60 apples\nKayla picked 4(60+10)=4(70)=280 apples\n#### 280\n## Argument in favour of B\nI will argue in favor of answer (B): 280.\n\nMy argument focuses on the algebraic approach and logical reasoning:\n\nThe key strength of solution (B) is its precise algebraic manipulation. By defining x as Kylie's apples and expressing Kayla's apples as 4(x+10), we create a more comprehensive equation. This method accounts for both Kylie's base amount and the additional factor of 10, ensuring a systematic solution.\n\nThe step-by-step algebraic process:\n1. Set up equation: 340 = x + 4(x+10)\n2. Expand: 340 = x + 4x + 40\n3. Simplify: 340 = 5x + 40\n4. Solve: 300 = 5x, x = 60\n5. Calculate Kayla's apples: 4(60+10) = 280\n\nThis approach demonstrates clear, logical problem-solving.\n"
