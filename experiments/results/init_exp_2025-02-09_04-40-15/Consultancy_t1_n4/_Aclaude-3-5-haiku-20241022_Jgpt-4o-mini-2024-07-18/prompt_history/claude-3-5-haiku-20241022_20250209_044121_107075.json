          "content": "Your Honor, I will argue in favor of Answer A: 12.0.\n\nThe key insight is to focus on the number of classes, not individual students. John has 6 classes, and he buys 2 packs per class. Therefore, the total number of packs is simply 6 multiplied by 2, which equals 12 packs.\n\nCalculating based on total students would overcomplicate the problem. By concentrating on the class-level perspective, we arrive at a straightforward and logical solution of 12 packs. This approach is more efficient and directly addresses the problem's core requirement of determining pack quantity.",
