          "content": "Your Honor, I will demonstrate why 7 weeks is the correct duration for Steve to complete reading the book.\n\nSteve consistently reads 100 pages on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday each week. This means he reads 300 pages per week. By dividing the total book length of 2100 pages by his weekly reading rate of 300 pages, we precisely calculate 7 weeks of reading time.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward: 2100 \u00f7 300 = 7. This method provides an exact, mathematically sound approach to determining the total reading duration. Each week, Steve systematically progresses through the book at a steady, predictable pace.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this reasoning?",
