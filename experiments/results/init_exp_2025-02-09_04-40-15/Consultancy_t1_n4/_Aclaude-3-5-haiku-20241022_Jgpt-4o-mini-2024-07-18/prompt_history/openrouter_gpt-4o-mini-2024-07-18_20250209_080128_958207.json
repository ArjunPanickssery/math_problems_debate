      "content": "QUESTION: Terese thinks that running various distances throughout the week can make one healthy.  On Monday, she runs 4.2 miles;  Tuesday, 3.8 miles; Wednesday, 3.6 miles; and on Thursday, 4.4 miles.  Determine the average distance Terese runs on each of the days she runs.\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 4.0\nThe total distance Terese runs is 4.2 + 3.8+4.4 +3.6 = 16 miles.\nTherefore, she runs with an average distance of 16 /4 = 4 miles.\n#### 4\n(B): 2.29\nThe total distance Terese runs is 4.2 + 3.8 + 3.6 + 4.4 = 16 miles.\nTherefore, her average distance is 16 / 7 = 2.29 miles.\n#### 2.29\n## Argument in favour of A\nI'll argue in favor of Answer A (4.0) if the judge has any questions.\n\nIf the judge asks me to explain the calculation, I would respond:\n\nTo calculate the average distance Terese runs, I first add up all her running distances for the days she runs: 4.2 + 3.8 + 3.6 + 4.4 = 16 miles. Then, I divide this total by the number of days she runs, which is 4. So 16 \u00f7 4 = 4 miles. This gives us the average distance per running day. The calculation is straightforward: total distance divided by total running days equals average distance.\n\nIf the judge asks why we divide by 4 and not 7, I would respond:\n\nWe divide by 4 because Terese runs on 4 specific days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. The question asks for her average running distance on the days she actually runs. We're not considering days she doesn't run, so we use 4 as our denominator, not 7 (which would include non-running days).\n"
