          "content": "I will argue in favor of Answer A (6.0). Here's my persuasive argument:\n\nThe solution is straightforward and mathematically precise. Peter owns 20 books, and he has read 40% of them, which calculates to exactly 8 books (20 \u00d7 0.4 = 8). His brother has read 10% of the same collection, which is 2 books (20 \u00d7 0.1 = 2). By simple subtraction, Peter has read 6 more books than his brother (8 - 2 = 6). The calculation follows standard percentage computation rules and provides a clear, direct answer without unnecessary complexity.",
