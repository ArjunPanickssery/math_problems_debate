          "content": "Your Honor, I will demonstrate why 44 yellow crayons is the correct solution. \n\nThe problem provides clear steps: we start with 14 red crayons, then calculate blue crayons as 5 more than red, which is 19 blue crayons. For yellow crayons, we double the blue crayons (19 \u00d7 2 = 38) and then add 6, resulting in 44 yellow crayons.\n\nThe key is understanding the sequential calculation: red (14) \u2192 blue (19) \u2192 yellow (38 + 6 = 44). Each step follows logically from the previous information, making 44 the precise number of yellow crayons.\n\nWould Your Honor like me to elaborate on any part of this reasoning?",
