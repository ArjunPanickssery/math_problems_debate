      "content": "QUESTION: Ali and Sara ate 80 small apples combined. Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara. How many apples did Sara eat?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 16.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: A = 4S\nWhich means: 4S + S = 80\nSo: 5S = 80\nSo the number of apples Sara ate is: S = 80 / 5= 16 apples\n#### 16\n(A): 64.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: S = 4A\nWhich means: A + 4A = 80\nSo: 5A = 80\nTherefore: A = 16\nAnd finally: S = 4A = 4 \u00d7 16 = 64 apples\n#### 64\n## Argument in favour of B\nI will argue in favor of answer (B): 16.0\n\nYour Honor, the solution of 16 apples for Sara is mathematically precise and logically sound. Let me break down the key reasoning:\n\nFirst, we establish two critical equations: \n1. Total apples: A + S = 80\n2. Relationship between Ali and Sara's apples: A = 4S\n\nBy algebraically manipulating these equations, we derive 5S = 80, which directly leads to S = 16. This proves Sara ate 16 apples.\n\nThe algebraic steps are clear, systematic, and demonstrate a straightforward solution path. The mathematics rigorously supports 16 as the correct answer.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this reasoning?\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the relationship between the number of apples eaten by Ali and Sara according to the problem statement?\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nYour Honor, according to the problem statement, Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara. This means if Sara ate S apples, Ali ate 4S apples.\n\nWe can mathematically represent this relationship as: A = 4S\n\nThis relationship is crucial because it directly links the number of apples Ali and Sara ate. When we say Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara, we're establishing a proportional relationship where Ali's apple count is always 4 times Sara's apple count.\n\nBy using this relationship in our equations, we can systematically solve for Sara's apple count, which leads us to the precise solution of 16 apples.\n\nWould you like me to demonstrate how this relationship helps us solve the problem?\n"
