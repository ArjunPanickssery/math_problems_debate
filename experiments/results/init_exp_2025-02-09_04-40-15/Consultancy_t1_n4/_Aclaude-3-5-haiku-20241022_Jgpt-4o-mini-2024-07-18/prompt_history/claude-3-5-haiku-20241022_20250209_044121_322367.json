By doubling the remaining $51 twice, we trace her spending pattern precisely. First, she doubles $51 to $102, representing the money after buying the toy. Then, she doubles $102 to $204, showing her balance before buying the book. Finally, doubling $204 gives us $408 as her original amount. \n\nThis methodical approach demonstrates how each spending step halves her money, making 408 the mathematically correct initial sum. The step-by-step verification ensures accuracy in tracking her expenditures.",
