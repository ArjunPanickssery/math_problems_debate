      "content": "QUESTION: Darla has 6 books in her locker.  Katie has half as many books as Darla, and Gary has 5 times the number of books that Darla and Katie have combined.  How many books do the three have total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 54.0\nDarla:6 books\nKatie:6/2=3 books\nGary: 5(6+3)=45 books\n6+3+45=54 books\n#### 54\n(B): 108.0\nDarla: 6 books\nKatie: 12 books\nGary: 5(6+12) = 90 books\n6+12+90 = 108 books\n#### 108\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, I will demonstrate why 54 books is the correct total for Darla, Katie, and Gary.\n\nFirst, let's verify Darla's book count. She clearly has 6 books, which is our starting point. Katie has half of Darla's books, which mathematically calculates to 3 books. This follows the problem's stated condition precisely.\n\nNext, Gary's book count is calculated by multiplying 5 times the combined books of Darla and Katie. Darla has 6 books, Katie has 3 books, so their combined total is 9. When multiplied by 5, Gary has 45 books.\n\nAdding these together: 6 + 3 + 45 = 54 books total. The math is straightforward and unambiguous.\n"
