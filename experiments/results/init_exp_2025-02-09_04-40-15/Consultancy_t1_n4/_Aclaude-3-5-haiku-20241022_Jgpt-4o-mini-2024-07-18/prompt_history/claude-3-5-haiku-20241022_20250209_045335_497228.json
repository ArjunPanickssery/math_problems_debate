          "content": "Your Honor, I will demonstrate why Isabel started with $204 in her piggy bank.\n\nLet me walk you through the precise mathematical reasoning. When Isabel first spent half her money on a toy, she was left with 102 dollars. Then, she spent half of that remaining amount on a book for her brother, which left her with $51.\n\nBy working backwards, we can confirm: $51 represents the final remaining amount, which doubled to $102 before buying the book, and then doubled again to $204 as her original amount.\n\nThe step-by-step calculation proves $204 is the correct initial sum in her piggy bank.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation?",
