      "content": "QUESTION: Asia bought a homecoming dress on sale for $140. It was originally priced at $350. What percentage off did she get at the sale?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nAsia saved $350 - $140 = $210 on the dress.\nThat means she saved $210 / $350 = 0.60 or 60% off on the dress.\n#### 60\n(A): 150\nFind the difference: $350 - $140 = $210\nCalculate the percentage off: $210/$140 = 1.5 or 150%\n#### 150\n## Argument in favour of B\nI understand that I'm advocating for Answer (B): 60.0, and I'll aim to convince the judge of this solution's correctness.\n\nIf the judge asks me about my reasoning, I'll respond:\n\nThe percentage off is calculated by dividing the amount saved by the original price and converting to a percentage. In this case, Asia saved $210 from an original price of $350. When we divide $210 by $350, we get 0.60, which represents 60% off. This method directly shows how much of the original price was discounted. The calculation is straightforward: ($350 - $140) \u00f7 $350 = 0.60 or 60%. The math proves the dress was purchased at a 60% discount.\n"
