          "content": "I understand. I will argue in favor of Answer (A): 25.0. I'll prepare to persuasively explain my reasoning to the judge if questioned.\n\nMy key argument is that in the Biology class with 100 students, the boys represent 1/4 of the total, which mathematically calculates to 25 boys. The logic follows these clear steps:\n1. Physics class has 200 students\n2. Biology class has half of Physics class: 200/2 = 100 students\n3. Girls are three times more numerous than boys\n4. This means boys are 1/4 of the total class\n5. 1/4 of 100 = 25 boys\n\nI'm ready to defend this calculation if the judge seeks clarification.",
