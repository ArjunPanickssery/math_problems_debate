          "content": "I will argue in favor of answer (B): 280.\n\nMy argument focuses on the algebraic approach and logical reasoning:\n\nThe key strength of solution (B) is its precise algebraic manipulation. By defining x as Kylie's apples and expressing Kayla's apples as 4(x+10), we create a more comprehensive equation. This method accounts for both Kylie's base amount and the additional factor of 10, ensuring a systematic solution.\n\nThe step-by-step algebraic process:\n1. Set up equation: 340 = x + 4(x+10)\n2. Expand: 340 = x + 4x + 40\n3. Simplify: 340 = 5x + 40\n4. Solve: 300 = 5x, x = 60\n5. Calculate Kayla's apples: 4(60+10) = 280\n\nThis approach demonstrates clear, logical problem-solving.",
