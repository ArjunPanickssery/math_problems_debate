          "content": "Your Honor, I will argue in favor of Answer (B): 68 hens. \n\nMy argument centers on the algebraic solution that correctly represents the problem's constraints. By letting x represent the number of roosters, we establish a clear relationship where the number of hens is 9x+5. When we set up the total chicken equation as 9x+5+x=75, we solve systematically:\n\n1. 10x+5=75\n2. 10x=70\n3. x=7 roosters\n4. Number of hens: 9(7)+5=68\n\nThis approach demonstrates precise mathematical reasoning, showing 7 roosters and 68 hens, which perfectly satisfies the total of 75 chickens. The solution is logically sound and algebraically correct.",
