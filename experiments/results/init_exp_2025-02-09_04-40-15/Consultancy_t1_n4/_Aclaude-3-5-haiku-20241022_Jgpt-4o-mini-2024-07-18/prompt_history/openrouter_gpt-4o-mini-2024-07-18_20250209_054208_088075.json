      "content": "QUESTION: Lyra bought a pair of shoes at a 20% discount.  If she paid $480, how much was the original price of the pair of shoes?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 600.0\nLyra only paid $480 for the pair of shoes which is only 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.\nSo let x be the original price.\nThen 0.8x = $480\nThus x = $480 / 0.8 = $600\n#### 600\n(A): 576\nThe discount amount is 20% of $480 = $96\nThe original price is $480 + $96 = $576\n#### 576\n## Argument in favour of B\nI will argue in favor of Answer B: $600.0\n\nMy key argument is straightforward mathematical precision. When Lyra receives a 20% discount, she pays 80% of the original price. By algebraically solving the equation 0.8x = $480, we directly calculate the original price as $600.\n\nThe calculation demonstrates clear logical steps:\n1. Discount is 20%, so she pays 80% of original price\n2. $480 represents 80% of original price\n3. To find 100% (original price), divide $480 by 0.8\n4. $480 \u00f7 0.8 = $600\n\nThis method provides a direct, unambiguous path to determining the original shoe price, making $600 the mathematically correct answer.\n"
