Carl teaches 6 periods with 30 students per class, totaling 180 students. Each student requires 10 index cards, which means he needs 1800 total cards. Since index cards come in 50-card packs priced at $3 each, he'll need 36 packs (1800 \u00f7 50 = 36). Multiplying 36 packs by $3 per pack yields exactly $108. This approach systematically breaks down the problem, showing clear, step-by-step logic that arrives at the correct total expenditure.",
