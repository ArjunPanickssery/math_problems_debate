      "content": "QUESTION: Peter has 20 books. He has read 40% of them. His brother has read 10% of them. How many more of these books has Peter read than his brother?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 6.0\nPeter has read 8 of these books because 20 x .4 = 8\nHis brother has read 2 of these books because 20 x .1 = 2\nPeter has read 6 more books than his brother because 8 - 2 = 6\n#### 6\n(B): 120\nPeter has read 8 of these books because 20 x .4 = 8\nHis brother has read 2 of these books because 20 x .1 = 2\nThe difference of 6 books needs to be scaled by the total collection size of 20 books to get the final answer: 6 x 20 = 120\n#### 120\n## Argument in favour of A\nI will argue in favor of Answer A (6.0). Here's my persuasive argument:\n\nThe solution is straightforward and mathematically precise. Peter owns 20 books, and he has read 40% of them, which calculates to exactly 8 books (20 \u00d7 0.4 = 8). His brother has read 10% of the same collection, which is 2 books (20 \u00d7 0.1 = 2). By simple subtraction, Peter has read 6 more books than his brother (8 - 2 = 6). The calculation follows standard percentage computation rules and provides a clear, direct answer without unnecessary complexity.\n"
