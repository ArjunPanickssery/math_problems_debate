      "content": "QUESTION: Isabel has some money in her piggy bank. She spent half the amount and bought a toy. She then spent half of the remaining money and bought her brother a book. If she has $51 left, how much money, in dollars, did she have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 204.0\nAfter buying the toy, Isabel has 51*2=102 dollars left.\nIsabel had 102*2=204 dollars at first.\n#### 204\n(A): 408.0\nWorking backwards from what's left:\n51 * 2 = 102 is the previous amount\n102 * 2 = 204 is the amount before that\n204 * 2 = 408 was the initial amount\n#### 408\n## Argument in favour of B\nYour Honor, I will demonstrate why Isabel started with $204 in her piggy bank.\n\nLet me walk you through the precise mathematical reasoning. When Isabel first spent half her money on a toy, she was left with 102 dollars. Then, she spent half of that remaining amount on a book for her brother, which left her with $51.\n\nBy working backwards, we can confirm: $51 represents the final remaining amount, which doubled to $102 before buying the book, and then doubled again to $204 as her original amount.\n\nThe step-by-step calculation proves $204 is the correct initial sum in her piggy bank.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation?\n"
