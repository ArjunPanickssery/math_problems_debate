Oli has 4 scoops of ice cream, and Victoria has twice as many. By simple multiplication, Victoria's total becomes 4 \u00d7 2 = 8 scoops. The difference between their ice cream quantities is 8 - 4 = 4 scoops. This direct calculation clearly shows Victoria has 4 more scoops than Oli, making answer (B) the correct choice.",
