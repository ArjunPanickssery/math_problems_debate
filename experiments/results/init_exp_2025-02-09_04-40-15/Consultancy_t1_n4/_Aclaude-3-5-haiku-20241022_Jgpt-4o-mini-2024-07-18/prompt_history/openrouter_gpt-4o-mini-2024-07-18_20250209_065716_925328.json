      "content": "QUESTION: If Stu has 9 books and Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu, how many books do Stu and Albert have in total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 45.0\nAlbert has 4 * 9 books belonging to Stu = 36 books.\nSo the pair have a combined total of 36 books belonging to Albert + 9 books belonging to Stu = 45 books.\n#### 45\n(B): 22.0\nFirst we determine Albert's books by taking Stu's 9 books and adding 4 for each book of Stu's = 13 books.\nThen we add both collections together: 13 + 9 = 22 books total.\n#### 22\n## Argument in favour of A\nI will argue in favor of Answer A: 45.0. Here's my argument:\n\nThe problem clearly states that Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu. Stu has 9 books, so Albert's book count is straightforward: 4 * 9 = 36 books. When we add Stu's 9 books to Albert's 36 books, we get a total of 45 books. The calculation is direct and follows the problem's instructions precisely. Each step is logically connected, and the arithmetic is simple and unambiguous.\n"
