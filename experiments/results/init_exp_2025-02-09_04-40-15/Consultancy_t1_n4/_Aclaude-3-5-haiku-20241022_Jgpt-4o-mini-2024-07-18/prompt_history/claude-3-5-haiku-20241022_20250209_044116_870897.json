          "content": "Your Honor, I will argue that Tim initially had 20 cans of soda. Let me break down the mathematical reasoning:\n\nWhen Jeff takes 6 cans, Tim is left with x - 6 cans. Then Tim purchases half the remaining amount, which is (x - 6)/2. When we add these together and set it equal to his final amount of 24 cans, we get the equation x - 6 + x/2 = 24.\n\nAlgebraically solving this equation:\n1. 2x - 12 + x = 48\n2. 3x = 60\n3. x = 20\n\nThis proves Tim started with exactly 20 cans of soda.
