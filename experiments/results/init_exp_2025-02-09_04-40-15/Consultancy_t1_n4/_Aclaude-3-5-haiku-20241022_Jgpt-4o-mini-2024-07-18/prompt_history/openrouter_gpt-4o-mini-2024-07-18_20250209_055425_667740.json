      "content": "QUESTION: Winwin won $50 in a lottery. She paid 20% for the tax and she paid $5 for the processing fee. How much was she able to take home?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 35.0\nWinwin paid $50 x 20/100 = $10 for the tax.\nSo, she has $50 - $10 = 40 after paying the tax.\nTherefore, Winwin was able to take home $40 - $5 = $35 after she paid for the processing fee.\n#### 35\n(B): 36.0\nFirst subtract the processing fee: $50 - $5 = $45\nThen calculate 20% tax of $45: $45 x 20/100 = $9\nTherefore, Winwin was able to take home $45 - $9 = $36\n#### 36\n## Argument in favour of A\nI will argue in favor of Answer (A): 35.0.\n\nMy argument focuses on the clear, step-by-step calculation that demonstrates Winwin's take-home amount. First, she won $50 and paid 20% tax, which is $10, leaving her with $40. Then, she paid a $5 processing fee, reducing her final amount to $35. This method follows a logical, sequential approach that directly calculates her net winnings by systematically subtracting required deductions.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward and transparent, showing each mathematical operation clearly. By first calculating the tax and then the processing fee, we ensure an accurate and traceable computation of her final take-home amount.\n"
