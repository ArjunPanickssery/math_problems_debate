      "content": "QUESTION: Isabel has some money in her piggy bank. She spent half the amount and bought a toy. She then spent half of the remaining money and bought her brother a book. If she has $51 left, how much money, in dollars, did she have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 204.0\nAfter buying the toy, Isabel has 51*2=102 dollars left.\nIsabel had 102*2=204 dollars at first.\n#### 204\n(A): 408.0\nWorking backwards from what's left:\n51 * 2 = 102 is the previous amount\n102 * 2 = 204 is the amount before that\n204 * 2 = 408 was the initial amount\n#### 408\n## Argument in favour of A\nI will argue in favor of answer (A): 408.0.\n\nMy argument focuses on the systematic backward calculation that reveals Isabel's initial amount. By doubling the remaining $51 twice, we trace her spending pattern precisely. First, she doubles $51 to $102, representing the money after buying the toy. Then, she doubles $102 to $204, showing her balance before buying the book. Finally, doubling $204 gives us $408 as her original amount. \n\nThis methodical approach demonstrates how each spending step halves her money, making 408 the mathematically correct initial sum. The step-by-step verification ensures accuracy in tracking her expenditures.\n"
