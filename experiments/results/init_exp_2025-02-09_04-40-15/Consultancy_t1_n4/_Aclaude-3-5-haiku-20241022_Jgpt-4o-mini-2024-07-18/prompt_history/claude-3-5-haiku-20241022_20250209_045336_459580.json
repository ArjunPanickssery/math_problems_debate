          "content": "I'll help you argue for Answer (B): 64.\n\nArgument for the Judge:\n\nYour Honor, the solution of 64 cm is mathematically precise and follows a clear, logical methodology. By recognizing that the middle piece (ratio 3) is 16 cm, we can calculate the unit length as 16 \u00f7 3 = 5.33 cm. This allows us to proportionally calculate the other segments: the longest piece (ratio 7) becomes 7 \u00d7 5.33 = 37.33 cm, and the shortest piece (ratio 2) becomes 2 \u00d7 5.33 = 10.67 cm.\n\nWhen we sum these segments (37.33 + 16 + 10.67), we definitively arrive at 64 cm as the total wire length. The approach maintains the original ratio and precisely accounts for the 16 cm shortest piece.",
