          "content": "Your Honor, I will demonstrate why the percentage off is 150%.\n\nTo calculate the percentage off, we divide the savings by the sale price, not the original price. Here's why: $210 (the amount saved) divided by $140 (the sale price) equals 1.5, which represents 150%.\n\nThis method shows the true discount relative to what Asia actually paid. By using the sale price as the denominator, we reveal the substantial markdown. The calculation proves that Asia received an extraordinary deal, with the discount exceeding the original price by 50%.\n\nThe mathematics clearly support a 150% off interpretation of this sale.",
