By meticulously adding their initial funds and subtracting all costs, we can confidently determine their change. Lee and his friend started with $18 total. Their food items - chicken wings, chicken salad, and two sodas - cost $11. When we add the $3 tax, the total expense becomes $14. Simple subtraction reveals they should receive $4 in change. This methodical approach ensures accuracy and demonstrates clear mathematical reasoning.",
