          "content": "Your Honor, I will demonstrate why 360 packs is the correct solution. \n\nJohn has 6 classes with 30 students in each class. First, we calculate the total number of students: 6 multiplied by 30 equals 180 students. Then, John buys 2 packs of index cards for each student. By multiplying 180 students by 2 packs per student, we arrive at 360 total packs.\n\nThis calculation ensures every single student receives their required index card packs. The math is straightforward and precise, leaving no room for alternative interpretations.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this reasoning?",
