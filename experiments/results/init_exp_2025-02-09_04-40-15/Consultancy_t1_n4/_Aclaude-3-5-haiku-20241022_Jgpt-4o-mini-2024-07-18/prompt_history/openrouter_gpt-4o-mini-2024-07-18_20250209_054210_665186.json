      "content": "QUESTION: Tim has some cans of soda. Jeff comes by, and takes 6 cans of soda from Tim. Tim then goes and buys another half the amount of soda cans he had left. If Tim has 24 cans of soda in the end, how many cans of soda did Tim have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 22.0\nLet x be the number of cans Tim has at first.\nAfter Jeff comes by, Tim has x-6 cans left.\nTim buys another (x-6)/2 cans.\nx-6+(x-6)/2=24\n2*x-12+x-6=48\n3*x-18=48\n3*x=66\nx=22\n#### 22\n(A): 20.0\nx - 6 + x/2 = 24\n2x - 12 + x = 48\n3x = 60\nx = 20\n#### 20\n## Argument in favour of B\nI will argue in favor of answer (B): 22.0.\n\nYour Honor, the solution of 22 cans is mathematically precise and follows a clear logical progression. Let me break down why this answer is correct:\n\nFirst, we start with an initial number of cans, x. When Jeff takes 6 cans, Tim is left with x-6 cans. Then Tim purchases half the remaining amount, which is (x-6)/2. \n\nThe algebraic equation x-6+(x-6)/2=24 perfectly captures the problem's dynamics. By solving this systematically - multiplying both sides, combining like terms, and isolating x - we arrive at 22 cans as the original quantity.\n\nThe step-by-step algebraic manipulation demonstrates the rigor of this solution.\n"
