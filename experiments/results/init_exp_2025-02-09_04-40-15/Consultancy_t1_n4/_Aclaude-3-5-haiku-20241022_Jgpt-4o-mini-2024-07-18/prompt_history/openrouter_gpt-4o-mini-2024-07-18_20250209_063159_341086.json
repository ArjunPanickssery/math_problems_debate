      "content": "QUESTION: On Wednesday, 37 students played kickball. On Thursday, 9 fewer students played kickball. How many students played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 65.0\n37 - 9 = 28 students played kickball on Thursday.\nSo, 37 + 28 = 65 students played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday.\n#### 65\n(A): 83.0\nOn Thursday, there was a difference of 9 students, so 37 + 9 = 46 students played on Thursday.\nTherefore, 37 + 46 = 83 students played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday.\n#### 83\n## Argument in favour of B\nI will argue in favor of Answer B (65.0) if the judge asks me questions about this problem. I am prepared to provide clear, concise arguments supporting this solution.\n"
