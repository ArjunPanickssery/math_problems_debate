          "content": "Your Honor, I will demonstrate why 54 books is the correct total for Darla, Katie, and Gary.\n\nFirst, let's verify Darla's book count. She clearly has 6 books, which is our starting point. Katie has half of Darla's books, which mathematically calculates to 3 books. This follows the problem's stated condition precisely.\n\nNext, Gary's book count is calculated by multiplying 5 times the combined books of Darla and Katie. Darla has 6 books, Katie has 3 books, so their combined total is 9. When multiplied by 5, Gary has 45 books.\n\nAdding these together: 6 + 3 + 45 = 54 books total. The math is straightforward and unambiguous.",
