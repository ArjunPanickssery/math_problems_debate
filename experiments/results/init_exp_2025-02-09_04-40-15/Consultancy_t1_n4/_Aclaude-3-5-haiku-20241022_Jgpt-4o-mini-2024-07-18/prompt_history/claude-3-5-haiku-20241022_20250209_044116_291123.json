However, this doesn't mean subtracting 4 from blue envelopes. Instead, it means the yellow envelopes are calculated by adding 4 to the blue envelope count. So with 10 blue envelopes, Wyatt actually has 10 + 4 = 14 yellow envelopes. When we total the blue and yellow envelopes, we get 10 + 14 = 24 total envelopes. This approach correctly interprets the \"4 fewer\" phrase in the problem statement.",
