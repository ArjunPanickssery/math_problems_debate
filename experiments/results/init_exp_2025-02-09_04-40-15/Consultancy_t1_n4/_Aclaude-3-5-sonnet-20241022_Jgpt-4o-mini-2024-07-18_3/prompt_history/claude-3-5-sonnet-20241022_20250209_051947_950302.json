          "content": "Let me argue for why answer (A) 8.0 is correct.\n\nTo find uncovered area, we need to calculate the total area of the box floor and subtract the area of the square block. The box floor is a rectangle with dimensions 4 inches \u00d7 6 inches, giving us a total area of 24 square inches. The square block has sides of 4 inches, so its area is 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 square inches. When we place this block in the box, it covers 16 square inches, leaving 24 - 16 = 8 square inches uncovered.\n\nAnswer (B) incorrectly uses perimeter instead of area. Perimeter measures the distance around shapes, while this question asks about uncovered space, which is an area measurement.",
