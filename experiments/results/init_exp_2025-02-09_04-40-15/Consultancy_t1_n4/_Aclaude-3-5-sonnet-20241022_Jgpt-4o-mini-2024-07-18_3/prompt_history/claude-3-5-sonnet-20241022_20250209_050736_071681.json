          "content": "To find the additional rainfall on Tuesdays compared to Mondays, we should focus on the excess rain per Tuesday. Each Tuesday had 2.5 cm while each Monday had 1.5 cm, giving us an excess of 1 cm per Tuesday. Since we had 9 Tuesdays, the total excess rainfall was 9 cm. The number of Mondays (7) is irrelevant because we're only interested in how much extra rain fell on each Tuesday. This is similar to comparing prices - if one store charges $1 more for 9 items, the total difference is $9, regardless of how many items the other store sells.",
