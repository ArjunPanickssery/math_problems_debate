      "content": "QUESTION: Laura bought 2 pairs of pants for $54 each and 4 shirts for $33 each. She gave $250 to the cashier. So how much change did she take?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 10.0\n54*2=$108 is the price of 2 pairs of pants.\n4*33=$132 is the price of 4 shirts.\n108+132=$240 is the total price.\nSo the cashier gave 250-240=$10 change to Laura.\n#### 10\n(A): -32\n33*2=$66 is the price of 2 pairs of pants\n4*54=$216 is the price of 4 shirts\n66+216=$282 is the total price\nSo 250-282=$-32 is the change\n#### -32\n## Argument in favour of B\nLet me argue for why answer (B) 10.0 is correct. The calculation is straightforward and follows the given information precisely. Laura bought 2 pairs of pants at $54 each, which equals $108 (54 \u00d7 2 = 108). She also bought 4 shirts at $33 each, totaling $132 (33 \u00d7 4 = 132). Adding these together gives us the total cost of $240 (108 + 132 = 240). Since she gave $250 to the cashier, her change would be $10 (250 - 240 = 10). This matches exactly with the store's pricing and common retail mathematics.\n"
