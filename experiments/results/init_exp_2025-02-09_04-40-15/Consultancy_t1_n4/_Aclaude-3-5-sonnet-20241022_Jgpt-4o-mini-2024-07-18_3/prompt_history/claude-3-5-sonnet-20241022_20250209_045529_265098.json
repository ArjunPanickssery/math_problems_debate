The Bulls won 70 games, and the Heat won 5 more than that, which means 75 games. To find the total games won together, we simply add these numbers: 70 + 75 = 145 games. Answer (B) incorrectly adds the difference of 5 games again, which would be double-counting and mathematically unsound. When we're asked to find games won \"together,\" we only need to sum the games each team won individually.",
