      "content": "QUESTION: James buys twice as many toy soldiers as toy cars.  He buys 20 toy cars.  How many total toys does he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nHe buys 2*20=40 toy cars\nSo the total number of toys is 20+40=60\n#### 60\n(A): 40.0\nHe buys twice as many toy soldiers as cars\nThis means he buys 2*20=40 toy soldiers\nThis is the total number of toys\n#### 40\n## Argument in favour of B\nLet me explain why 60 is the correct total number of toys. James buys 20 toy cars, and twice as many toy soldiers. This means he buys 40 toy soldiers (2 \u00d7 20 = 40). To find the total number of toys, we need to add both the toy cars and toy soldiers together: 20 toy cars + 40 toy soldiers = 60 total toys. This calculation accounts for all toys purchased, making 60 the complete and accurate total.\n"
