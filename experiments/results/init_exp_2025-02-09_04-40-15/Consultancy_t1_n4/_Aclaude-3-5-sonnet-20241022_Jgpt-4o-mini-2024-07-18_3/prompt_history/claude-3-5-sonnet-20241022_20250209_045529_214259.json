          "content": "Let me argue for answer (B): $1800. \n\nFirst, let's consider the total number of index cards needed. With 30 students in each of the 6 periods, that's 180 students total. Each student needs 10 cards, so we multiply 180 by 10, giving us 1,800 cards total. This large number makes sense given the size of Carl's teaching load.\n\nWhen calculating the cost, we must consider that $3 is a reasonable price point for school supplies. If we divide 1,800 by 3, we get 600 packs needed. Multiplying 600 packs by $3 per pack gives us $1,800, which aligns with typical school supply budgets for large classes.",
