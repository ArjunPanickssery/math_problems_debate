          "content": "Let me argue for why 5 classes per semester is the correct answer.\n\nTo graduate, Maddy needs 120 total credits. Since each class is worth 3 credits, we can calculate the total number of classes needed by dividing 120 by 3, which gives us 40 total classes. Spreading these 40 classes across 8 semesters means taking 5 classes per semester (40 \u00f7 8 = 5).\n\nThis answer is also practical and realistic. Most college students typically take 4-6 classes per semester, making 5 classes a standard course load. Taking 15 classes per semester would be impossible - there aren't enough hours in the day to attend that many classes!\n\nWould you like me to clarify any part of this reasoning?",
