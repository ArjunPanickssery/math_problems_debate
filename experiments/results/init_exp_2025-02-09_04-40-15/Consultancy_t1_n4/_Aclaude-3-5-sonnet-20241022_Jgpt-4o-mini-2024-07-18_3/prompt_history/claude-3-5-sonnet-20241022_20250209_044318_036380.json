This clearly indicates subtraction - we need to subtract 9 from Wednesday's number (37) to get Thursday's number. So, Thursday had 28 students (37 - 9 = 28). To find the total number of students who played across both days, we simply add Wednesday's 37 students and Thursday's 28 students, giving us 65 students total.",
