      "content": "QUESTION: Darla has 6 books in her locker.  Katie has half as many books as Darla, and Gary has 5 times the number of books that Darla and Katie have combined.  How many books do the three have total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 54.0\nDarla:6 books\nKatie:6/2=3 books\nGary: 5(6+3)=45 books\n6+3+45=54 books\n#### 54\n(B): 108.0\nDarla: 6 books\nKatie: 12 books\nGary: 5(6+12) = 90 books\n6+12+90 = 108 books\n#### 108\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me argue for why 54 is the correct answer. The problem states Katie has \"half as many books as Darla.\" Since Darla has 6 books, Katie must have 3 books (6 \u00f7 2 = 3). This is crucial because the alternative interpretation suggesting Katie has 12 books would mean she has twice as many, not half as many. For Gary's books, we multiply the sum of Darla and Katie's books (6 + 3 = 9) by 5, giving us 45 books. Adding all three together (6 + 3 + 45) gives us 54 books total.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the exact wording of the problem regarding the number of books Katie has in relation to Darla? Does it explicitly state \"half as many\" or something else? \n\nCan you clarify how Gary's number of books is calculated based on the combined total of Darla and Katie's books? \n\nIs there any ambiguity in the phrasing of the problem that could lead to different interpretations of the relationships between the number of books each person has? \n\nWhat is the reasoning behind the calculation that leads to the answer of 108 books? \n\nAre there any mathematical principles or rules that should be considered when interpreting the relationships and calculations in this problem?\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me address your questions while arguing for answer A (54 books):\n\nThe problem states \"Katie has half as many books as Darla,\" which is a direct mathematical relationship meaning we must divide Darla's 6 books by 2, resulting in 3 books for Katie. The wording \"half as many\" is unambiguous and clearly indicates division by 2, not multiplication.\n\nFor Gary's books, the problem states he has \"5 times the number of books that Darla and Katie have combined.\" This means we first add Darla's 6 and Katie's 3 books (9 total), then multiply by 5, giving Gary 45 books. The phrase \"combined\" clearly indicates addition before multiplication.\n\nThe mathematical principle of order of operations supports this interpretation: we must first establish Katie's books (6\u00f72=3), then combine Darla and Katie's books (6+3=9), before multiplying by 5 for Gary's books (9\u00d75=45). This systematic approach leads to the correct total of 54 books.\n"
