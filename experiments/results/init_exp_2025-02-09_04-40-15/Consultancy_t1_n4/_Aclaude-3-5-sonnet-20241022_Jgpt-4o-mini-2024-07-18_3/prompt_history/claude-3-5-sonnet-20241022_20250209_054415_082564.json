          "content": "The answer is clearly 19 lives. The question states that a dog has \"3 less lives than a cat,\" but this is ambiguous English phrasing. In mathematical terms, when we say \"less than,\" we're often referring to a comparison where we need to add to reach the higher number. So, to get from the dog's lives to the cat's lives, we add 3. Therefore, if a cat has 9 lives, a dog must have 12 lives (9 + 3). Then, since a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog, we add 7 to 12, giving us 19 lives for the mouse.",
