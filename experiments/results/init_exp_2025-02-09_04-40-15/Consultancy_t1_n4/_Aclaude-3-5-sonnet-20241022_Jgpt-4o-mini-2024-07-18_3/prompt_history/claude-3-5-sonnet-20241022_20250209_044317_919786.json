          "content": "The statement \"5 more than half the cows are black\" means we need to first consider the total number of cows (18) plus 5, which gives us 23. Taking half of 23 (11.5, rounded to 12) gives us the number of black cows. This interpretation aligns with the natural language structure of the phrase, where \"5 more than half\" is treated as a single unit. With 12 black cows out of 18 total cows, we can calculate that 6 cows are not black (18 - 12 = 6).",
