      "content": "QUESTION: 4.5 gallons of coffee were divided among 18 thermoses. Genevieve drank 3 thermoses. How many pints of coffee did Genevieve drink?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 6.0\n4.5 gallons = 4.5 * 8 pints = 36 pints\n36/18 = 2 pints\nGenevieve drank 2*3=6 pints of coffee.\n#### 6\n(A): 3.0\n4.5 gallons = 4.5 * 4 pints = 18 pints\n18/18 = 1 pint per thermos\nGenevieve drank 1*3 = 3 pints of coffee.\n#### 3\n## Argument in favour of B\nLet me argue for answer (B): 6.0 pints.\n\nThe key fact here is that 1 gallon equals 8 pints, which is a standard conversion in the US measurement system. Starting with 4.5 gallons, we multiply by 8 to get 36 pints total. When this is divided equally among 18 thermoses, each thermos contains 2 pints (36 \u00f7 18 = 2). Since Genevieve drank 3 thermoses, she consumed 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 pints of coffee.\n\nThe alternative answer incorrectly uses 4 pints per gallon, which is not the correct conversion. This would significantly underestimate the amount of coffee Genevieve drank.\n"
