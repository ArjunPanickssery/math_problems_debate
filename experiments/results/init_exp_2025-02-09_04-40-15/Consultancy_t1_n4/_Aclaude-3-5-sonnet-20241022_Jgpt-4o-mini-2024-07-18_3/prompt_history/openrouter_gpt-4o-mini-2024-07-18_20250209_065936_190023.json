      "content": "QUESTION: Twenty gallons of tea were poured into 80 containers. Geraldo drank 3.5 containers. How many pints of tea did Geraldo drink?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 7.0\n20 gallons = 160 pints\n160/80 = 2 pints\n3.5 * 2 pints = 7 pints\nGeraldo drank 7 pints of tea.\n#### 7\n(B): 5.25\n20 gallons = 120 pints\n120/80 = 1.5 pints\n3.5 * 1.5 pints = 5.25 pints\nGeraldo drank 5.25 pints of tea.\n#### 5.25\n## Argument in favour of B\nLet me argue for why 5.25 pints is the correct answer. The conversion rate from gallons to pints is 6 pints per gallon, which means 20 gallons equals 120 pints (20 \u00d7 6 = 120). When we divide these 120 pints among 80 containers, each container holds 1.5 pints (120 \u00f7 80 = 1.5). Since Geraldo drank 3.5 containers, he consumed 3.5 \u00d7 1.5 = 5.25 pints of tea. This calculation uses the standard US liquid measurement conversion, which is more accurate than assuming 8 pints per gallon.\n"
