      "content": "QUESTION: Terese thinks that running various distances throughout the week can make one healthy.  On Monday, she runs 4.2 miles;  Tuesday, 3.8 miles; Wednesday, 3.6 miles; and on Thursday, 4.4 miles.  Determine the average distance Terese runs on each of the days she runs.\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 4.0\nThe total distance Terese runs is 4.2 + 3.8+4.4 +3.6 = 16 miles.\nTherefore, she runs with an average distance of 16 /4 = 4 miles.\n#### 4\n(B): 2.29\nThe total distance Terese runs is 4.2 + 3.8 + 3.6 + 4.4 = 16 miles.\nTherefore, her average distance is 16 / 7 = 2.29 miles.\n#### 2.29\n## Argument in favour of B\nWhen calculating Terese's average running distance, we must consider the entire week, which is 7 days, not just the days she runs. Since she only runs on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, there are three days (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) where she runs 0 miles. To find the true average, we need to divide her total distance (16 miles) by all seven days of the week, giving us 16/7 = 2.29 miles. This reflects a more accurate representation of her daily running habits, including rest days.\n"
