          "content": "To find how many more calories Jacob ate than planned, we need to compare his actual intake with his goal. Adding his meals: 400 (breakfast) + 900 (lunch) + 1100 (dinner) = 2400 calories total. Since his goal was 1800 calories, we subtract 1800 from 2400 to find the excess: 2400 - 1800 = 600 calories over his goal. This makes logical sense because we're finding the difference between what he ate and what he planned to eat. The other answer incorrectly adds the numbers instead of subtracting, which wouldn't show the excess calories.",
