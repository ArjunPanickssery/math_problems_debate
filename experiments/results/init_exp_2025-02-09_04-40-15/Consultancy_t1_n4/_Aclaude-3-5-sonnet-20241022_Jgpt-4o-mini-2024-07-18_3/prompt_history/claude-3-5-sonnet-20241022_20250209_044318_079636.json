For the next rows, he has 2 less than the blocks he has from its bottom row.

          "content": "Let me argue for answer (B) 25 blocks. The key is understanding that each row has 2 fewer blocks than the row directly below it, creating a true pyramid shape. Starting with 9 blocks at the base, we can systematically calculate each row:\n\nRow 1 (bottom): 9 blocks\nRow 2: 7 blocks (9-2)\nRow 3: 5 blocks (7-2)\nRow 4: 3 blocks (5-2)\nRow 5 (top): 1 block (3-2)\n\nThis creates a visually balanced pyramid structure where each row is progressively smaller than the previous one. The total sum of 9+7+5+3+1=25 blocks represents a perfect pyramid formation.",
