      "content": "QUESTION: Carol sells tickets for an exhibition. During three days she sold tickets worth $960. One ticket costs $4. How many tickets on average did she sell during one of these three days?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 80.0\nCarol sold 960 / 4 = 240 tickets during three days.\nSo in one day, she sold on average 240 / 3 = 80 tickets.\n#### 80\n(A): 1280\nFirst divide the total money by days to get daily revenue\n$960 / 3 = $320 per day\nThen since each ticket is $4, that means she sold 320 \u00d7 4 = 1280 tickets per day\n#### 1280\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me argue for answer (A). When calculating daily ticket sales, we need to first determine Carol's daily revenue. Since she made $960 over three days, dividing $960 by 3 gives us $320 per day. Now, since each ticket costs $4, we multiply the daily revenue ($320) by 4 to get the number of tickets sold per day. This multiplication is necessary because we're converting from dollars to tickets, and more tickets are sold than the dollar amount suggests. Therefore, 320 \u00d7 4 = 1280 tickets per day is the correct average.\n"
