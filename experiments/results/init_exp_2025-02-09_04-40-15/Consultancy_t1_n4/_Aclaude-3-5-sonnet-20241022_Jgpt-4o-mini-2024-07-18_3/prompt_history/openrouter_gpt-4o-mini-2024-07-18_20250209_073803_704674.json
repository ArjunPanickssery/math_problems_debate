      "content": "QUESTION: Sami finds 3 spiders in the playground.  Hunter sees 12 ants climbing the wall.  Ming discovers 8 ladybugs in the sandbox, and watches 2 of them fly away. How many insects are remaining in the playground?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 21.0\nThe children find 3 + 12 + 8 = 23 insects.\nAfter the ladybugs fly away, there are 23 - 2 = 21 insects.\n#### 21\n(A): 18.0\nLet's count the remaining insects:\nAnts remain constant at 12\nFor ladybugs, start with 8 and subtract 2 that flew = 6 ladybugs\nSpiders are not counted in our insect total\nSo total insects = 12 + 6 = 18\n#### 18\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe answer is clearly 18 insects because spiders are not actually insects - they're arachnids. Spiders have 8 legs and 2 body segments, while insects have 6 legs and 3 body segments. We should only count the 12 ants (which stayed constant) and the 6 remaining ladybugs (8 original minus 2 that flew away). This gives us 12 + 6 = 18 insects total. Including spiders in an insect count would be a scientific error, as they belong to an entirely different taxonomic class.\n"
