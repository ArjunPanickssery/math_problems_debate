          "content": "The answer is clearly 37 shirts. Let me break down why this is correct:\n\nThe question states Mary gives away HALF of her blue shirts and ONE-THIRD of her brown shirts. For blue shirts, half of 26 is 13 (26\u00f72=13). For brown shirts, one-third of 36 is 12 (36\u00f73=12). This means she keeps 13 blue shirts and 24 brown shirts (36-12=24). Adding these together (13+24) gives us exactly 37 shirts.\n\nThe other answer incorrectly assumes she gives away half of her brown shirts and one-third of her blue shirts, which is the opposite of what the question states. This leads to the wrong calculation and result of 35.",
