          "content": "The key detail in the question states \"3 hours to drive to town and back,\" which means 3 hours one way. This is logical because the question specifically separates the journey into two parts - \"to town\" and \"back.\" Therefore, a complete round trip takes 6 hours. Since Melissa makes two trips monthly, that's 12 hours of driving per month. Multiplying by 12 months gives us 144 hours annually. The alternative answer of 72 hours incorrectly assumes the 3-hour duration covers both directions, which contradicts the question's wording.",
