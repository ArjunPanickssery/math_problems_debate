      "content": "QUESTION: Jack buys a squat rack for $2500.  The barbell cost 1/10 as much.  How much did he pay for everything?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2750.0\nThe barbell cost 2500/10=$250\nSo he paid 2500+250=$2750 for everything\n#### 2750\n(B): 2250\nThe squat rack costs $2500\nFor the barbell at 1/10 the price: 2500/10 = 250\nApplying this difference to the total: 2500 - 250 = 2250\n#### 2250\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe answer is clearly $2,750. Let's break this down logically: Jack spent $2,500 on the squat rack, and the barbell costs 1/10 of that amount, which is $250 (2500 \u00f7 10 = 250). Since Jack purchased both items, we need to add these amounts together: $2,500 + $250 = $2,750. This follows basic arithmetic principles where the total cost equals the sum of individual items. The problem specifically asks for how much he paid for \"everything,\" which means we must include both the rack and barbell in our calculation.\n"
