Then, the problem states he eats \"twice as many after dinner.\" This means he eats 2 more bags after dinner (2 \u00d7 1 = 2). To find the total, we add the dinner bag (1) plus the after-dinner bags (2), giving us 3 bags total. The key phrase \"twice as many\" refers to additional bags, not the running total.",
