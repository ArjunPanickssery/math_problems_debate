          "content": "The correct distance is clearly 780 miles. When calculating travel distance, we only consider active driving time, not breaks. Jace drives for 4 hours initially and then 9 hours after the break, giving us a total driving time of 13 hours. Since he maintains a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, we multiply 60 by the total driving hours (13) to get 780 miles. Including the 30-minute break in our calculations would be a mistake since no distance is covered during rest periods, just as we wouldn't count overnight stops or fuel breaks when calculating total distance traveled.",
