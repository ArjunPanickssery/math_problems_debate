      "content": "QUESTION: Katie has 13 pink marbles. She has 9 fewer orange marbles than pink marbles. She has 4 times as many purple marbles as orange marbles. How many marbles does Katie have in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 33.0\nFind the number of orange marbles. 13 marbles - 9 marbles = 4 marbles\nFind the number of purple marbles. 4 marbles x 4 = 16marbles\nFind the total amount of pink, orange, and purple marbles. 13 marbles + 4 marbles + 16 marbles = 45 marbles\n#### 33\n(A): 123\nFind the number of orange marbles. 13 marbles + 9 marbles = 22 marbles\nFind the number of purple marbles. 22 marbles \u00d7 4 = 88 marbles\nFind the total amount of pink, orange, and purple marbles. 13 marbles + 22 marbles + 88 marbles = 123 marbles\n#### 123\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe key phrase \"9 fewer orange marbles than pink marbles\" clearly indicates subtraction, not addition. If Katie has 13 pink marbles and 9 fewer orange marbles, she must have 4 orange marbles (13 - 9 = 4). This is a crucial distinction that answer A misinterprets. Following the problem's logic, she then has 4 times as many purple marbles as orange marbles, so that's 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 purple marbles. Adding all marbles (13 pink + 4 orange + 16 purple) equals 33 marbles total.\n"
