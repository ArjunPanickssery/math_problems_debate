      "content": "QUESTION: June made a design with 20 equal tiles. Three tiles are yellow and the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles. Six tiles are purple and the remaining tiles are white.  How many white tiles are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 7.0\nThere are 3 + 1 = 4 blue tiles.\nThere are a total of 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 tiles are yellow, blue, and purple.\nHence, 20 - 13 = 7 tiles are white.\n#### 7\n(B): 10.0\nThe yellow and blue tiles together total 3 + 1 = 4 tiles.\nAdding the purple tiles gives us 4 + 6 = 10 colored tiles.\nTherefore, 20 - 10 = 10 tiles must be white.\n#### 10\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me argue for answer (A) that there are 7 white tiles:\n\nThe problem clearly states that there are 3 yellow tiles, and the number of blue tiles is one more than yellow, which means 4 blue tiles. When we add these together with the 6 purple tiles mentioned, we get 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 colored tiles in total. Since we know there are exactly 20 tiles in total, we can subtract the colored tiles from the total to find the white tiles: 20 - 13 = 7 white tiles. This calculation accounts for all tiles mentioned in the problem without double-counting or missing any.\n"
