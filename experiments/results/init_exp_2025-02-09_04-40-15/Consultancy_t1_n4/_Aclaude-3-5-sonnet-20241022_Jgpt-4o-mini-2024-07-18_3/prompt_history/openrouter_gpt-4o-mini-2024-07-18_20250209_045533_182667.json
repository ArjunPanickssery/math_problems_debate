      "content": "QUESTION: A housewife goes to the market. She spent 2/3 of her $150. How much does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50\n(A): 100.0\nFirst calculate what fraction remains: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\nSince 2/3 was spent, multiply $150 by 2/3: $150 * (2/3) = $100\nThis is the amount she has left.\n#### 100\n## Argument in favour of B\nLet me argue for answer (B): $50.\n\nThe solution is straightforward using fraction arithmetic. If the housewife spent 2/3 of her money, she must have 1/3 left (since 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3). To find the dollar amount, we multiply the total ($150) by the remaining fraction (1/3). Using a calculator:\n\n$150 \u00d7 (1/3) = $50\n\nThis is mathematically sound because if we check our work by adding what she spent (2/3 of $150 = $100) and what she has left ($50), we get back to the original amount: $100 + $50 = $150.\n"
