If she paid $480, how much was the original price of the pair of shoes?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 600.0\nLyra only paid $480 for the pair of shoes which is only 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.\nSo let x be the original price.\nThen 0.8x = $480\nThus x = $480 / 0.8 = $600\n#### 600\n(A): 576\nThe discount amount is 20% of $480 = $96\nThe original price is $480 + $96 = $576\n#### 576\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 600.0\nLyra only paid $480 for the pair of shoes which is only 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.\nSo let x be the original price.\nThen 0.8x = $480\nThus x = $480 / 0.8 = $600\n#### 600"

          "content": "Let me argue for why $600 is the correct original price:\n\nThe key is understanding that $480 represents 80% of the original price, not 100%. When calculating backwards from a discounted price, we need to divide by the percentage paid (0.8) rather than add the discount amount. Let me demonstrate:\n\nIf the original price was $600:\n- 20% discount = $600 \u00d7 0.2 = $120 discount\n- Final price = $600 - $120 = $480\n\nThis perfectly matches what Lyra paid. We can verify this matches the given information: she paid $480 after a 20% discount, and $480 is indeed 80% of $600.",
