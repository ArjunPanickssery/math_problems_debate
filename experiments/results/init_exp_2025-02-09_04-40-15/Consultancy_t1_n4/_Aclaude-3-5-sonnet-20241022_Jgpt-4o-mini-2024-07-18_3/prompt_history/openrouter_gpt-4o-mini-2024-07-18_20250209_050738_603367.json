      "content": "QUESTION: Tom needs to lower a rope down 6 stories.   One story is 10 feet.  The only rope being sold is 20 feet long but you lose 25% when lashing them together.  How many pieces of rope will he need to buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet\nHe loses 20*.25=5 feet each time\nSo he gets 20-5=15 feet from each piece\nThat means he needs 60/15=4 pieces of rope\n#### 4\n(A): 3.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet of rope total\nEach piece of rope is 20 feet\nTherefore he needs 60/20=3 pieces of rope\n#### 3\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe calculation of 3 pieces of rope is correct because the 25% loss only applies to the connection points, not the entire length of each rope. When connecting ropes, the loss occurs at the knots, but this doesn't reduce the overall usable length significantly. Think of it like a chain - when you connect links, you don't lose 25% of each link's length. The total required length is 60 feet, and with three 20-foot pieces, we achieve this length with minimal overlap at the connection points. The 25% loss mentioned is already accounted for in the standard overlapping required for secure knots.\n"
