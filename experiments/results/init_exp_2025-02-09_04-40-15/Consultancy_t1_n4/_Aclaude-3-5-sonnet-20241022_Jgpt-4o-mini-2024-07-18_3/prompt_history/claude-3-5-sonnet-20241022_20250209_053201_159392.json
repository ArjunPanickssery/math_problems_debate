          "content": "When calculating a discount, we need to focus on what percentage the customer actually pays, not what they save. A 40% discount means Maria pays 40% of the original price. The calculation is straightforward: we multiply the original price ($15) by 40% (or 0.40). This gives us $6, which is the final amount Maria paid.\n\nThink about it like this: if a store advertises \"40% OFF!\", they're telling you that you only need to pay 40 cents for every dollar of the original price. Therefore, Maria paid 40% of $15, which equals $6.\n\nWould you like me to clarify any part of this explanation?",
