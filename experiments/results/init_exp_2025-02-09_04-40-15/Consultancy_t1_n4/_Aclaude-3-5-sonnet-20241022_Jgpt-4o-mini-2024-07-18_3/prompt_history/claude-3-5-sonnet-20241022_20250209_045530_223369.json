          "content": "Let me explain why the answer is 810. When Brianne doubles her savings each month, she's not just doubling the previous amount - she's also adding it to her existing savings. This is because savings accumulate over time. So in February, she adds $20 (double of $10) to her existing $10, making it $30. Following this pattern, in March she adds $60 to $30, reaching $90. In April, she adds $180 to $90, reaching $270. Finally, in May, she adds $540 to $270, reaching $810.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about this calculation method.",
