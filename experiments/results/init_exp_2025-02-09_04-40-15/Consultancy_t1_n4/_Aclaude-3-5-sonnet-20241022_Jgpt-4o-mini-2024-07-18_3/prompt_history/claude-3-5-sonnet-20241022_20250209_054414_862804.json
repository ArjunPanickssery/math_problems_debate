          "content": "The correct interpretation is that Kayla picked \"10 more than 4 times\" Kylie's amount, which algebraically translates to 10+4x, not 4(x+10). This is because the phrase \"10 more than\" indicates addition after multiplication, not before. Let me demonstrate with numbers:\n\nIf Kylie picked 66 apples:\n1. First, multiply by 4: 4 \u00d7 66 = 264\n2. Then add 10: 264 + 10 = 274\n\nThis gives us 274 apples for Kayla, and when we add Kylie's 66 apples, we get our total of 340 apples. The alternative interpretation would incorrectly distribute the \"10 more than\" inside the multiplication.",
