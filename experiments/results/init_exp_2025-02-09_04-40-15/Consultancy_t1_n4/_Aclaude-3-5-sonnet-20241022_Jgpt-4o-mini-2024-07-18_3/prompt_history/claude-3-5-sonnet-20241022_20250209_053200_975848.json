          "content": "Let me argue for answer (A) being correct. The key is understanding the sequence of events:\n\n1. Tim starts with x cans\n2. Jeff takes 6 cans, leaving (x-6)\n3. Tim buys half of his original amount (x/2), not half of what's left\n4. Final amount is 24 cans\n\nThe equation x - 6 + x/2 = 24 correctly represents this sequence. When Tim buys more soda, he buys half of his original amount (x/2), not half of what remained after Jeff took some. This makes more sense because Tim likely planned his purchase based on his usual stock, not the depleted amount. Solving this equation gives us x = 20, which we can verify: 20 - 6 + 10 = 24.",
