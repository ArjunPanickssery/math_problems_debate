      "content": "QUESTION: Mary has 26 blue shirts and 36 brown shirts. If she gives away half of her blue shirts and a third of her brown shirts, how many shirts does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 37.0\nMary gives away 26/2 = 13 blue shirts.\nMary gives away 36/3 = 12 brown shirts.\nMary has 26-13 = 13 blue shirts left.\nMary has 36-12 = 24 brown shirts left.\nMary has 13+24 = 37 shirts left.\n#### 37\n(A): 35.0\nMary gives away 36/2 = 18 brown shirts.\nMary gives away 26/3 \u2248 9 blue shirts.\nMary has 26-9 = 17 blue shirts left.\nMary has 36-18 = 18 brown shirts left.\nMary has 17+18 = 35 shirts left.\n#### 35\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe answer is clearly 37 shirts. Let me break down why this is correct:\n\nThe question states Mary gives away HALF of her blue shirts and ONE-THIRD of her brown shirts. For blue shirts, half of 26 is 13 (26\u00f72=13). For brown shirts, one-third of 36 is 12 (36\u00f73=12). This means she keeps 13 blue shirts and 24 brown shirts (36-12=24). Adding these together (13+24) gives us exactly 37 shirts.\n\nThe other answer incorrectly assumes she gives away half of her brown shirts and one-third of her blue shirts, which is the opposite of what the question states. This leads to the wrong calculation and result of 35.\n"
