          "content": "Let me argue for why 300 minutes is the correct answer.\n\nWhen someone runs twice as fast, they cover the same distance in half the time. Since Lexie takes 20 minutes for one mile, Celia, being twice as fast, will take half that time: 20 \u00f7 2 = 10 minutes per mile. This is a fundamental principle of speed relationships.\n\nTo find the total time for 30 miles, we multiply Celia's per-mile time by 30: 10 \u00d7 30 = 300 minutes. The alternative answer of 1200 minutes incorrectly doubles Lexie's time instead of halving it, which contradicts the meaning of \"twice as fast.\"",
