How many hours does he have to watch a day?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2.0\nHe wants to watch 20*30=600 minutes\nSo he needs to watch 600/60=10 hours\nThat means he needs to watch 10/5=2 hours a day\n#### 2\n(B): 1.2\nFirst find total minutes: 20 * 30 = 600 minutes\nConvert to hours: 600 / 100 = 6 hours total\nDivide by 5 days: 6 / 5 = 1.2 hours per day\n#### 1.2\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 2.0\nHe wants to watch 20*30=600 minutes\nSo he needs to watch 600/60=10 hours\nThat means he needs to watch 10/5=2 hours a day\n#### 2"

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 minutes (not 100), giving us 600 \u00f7 60 = 10 total hours. Since John wants to finish in 5 days, he needs to watch 10 \u00f7 5 = 2 hours each day. This calculation uses the correct conversion factor of 60 minutes per hour, unlike the other solution which incorrectly divides by 100.",
