How many more centimeters did it rain on Tuesdays than Mondays?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 12.0\nMondays: 7 * 1.5 = 10.5\nTuesdays: 9 * 2.5 = 22.5\n22.5 - 10.5 = 12 cm\nIt rained 12 centimeters more on Tuesdays than on Mondays.\n#### 12\n(B): 9.0\nLet's find the difference per day: 2.5 - 1.5 = 1\nSince there were 9 Tuesdays, multiply by 9\n1 * 9 = 9\nTherefore, it rained 9 centimeters more on Tuesdays than Mondays.\n#### 9\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 12.0\nMondays: 7 * 1.5 = 10.5\nTuesdays: 9 * 2.5 = 22.5\n22.5 - 10.5 = 12 cm\nIt rained 12 centimeters more on Tuesdays than on Mondays.\n#### 12"

          "content": "To find the total difference in rainfall between Tuesdays and Mondays, we need to calculate the total rainfall for each day and then subtract. For Mondays, we had 7 days of 1.5 cm rain, giving us 10.5 cm total. For Tuesdays, we had 9 days of 2.5 cm rain, totaling 22.5 cm. The difference between these totals (22.5 - 10.5) gives us 12 centimeters more rain on Tuesdays than Mondays. This approach accounts for both the different number of days and different rainfall amounts.",
