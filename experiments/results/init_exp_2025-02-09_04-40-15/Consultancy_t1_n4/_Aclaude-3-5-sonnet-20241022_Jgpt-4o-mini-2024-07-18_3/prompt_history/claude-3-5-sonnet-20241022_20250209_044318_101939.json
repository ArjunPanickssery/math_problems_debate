          "content": "Let me argue for answer (B) that Sara ate 16 apples. The problem states that Ali ate 4 times MORE apples than Sara, which means Ali's portion (A) equals 4 times Sara's portion (S). This is correctly expressed as A = 4S. Since their total is 80 apples (A + S = 80), we can substitute A with 4S: 4S + S = 80. This gives us 5S = 80, leading to S = 16 apples for Sara. The other answer incorrectly interprets the relationship between Ali and Sara's portions.",
