          "content": "Let me argue for why 64 is the correct answer. The key is understanding we need to account for the time difference twice. Twenty years ago, Shane was twice Garret's current age (24 years). Since then, we need to add 20 years to reach Shane's current age, and another 20 years to account for the time gap mentioned in the problem. This gives us 24 + 20 + 20 = 64 years old. Let me demonstrate with a timeline:\n\nToday: Garret is 12\n20 years ago: Shane was 24 (twice Garret's current age)\nTime adjustment: +40 years (20 years twice)\nFinal age: 64 years old",
