This means we add 6 to 30 to get 36 green bowling balls. To find the total, we simply add the number of red balls (30) and green balls (36), which gives us 66 bowling balls. Answer B incorrectly adds the number 6 twice, leading to an inflated total. The question only mentions red and green balls, so we only need to sum these two quantities.",
