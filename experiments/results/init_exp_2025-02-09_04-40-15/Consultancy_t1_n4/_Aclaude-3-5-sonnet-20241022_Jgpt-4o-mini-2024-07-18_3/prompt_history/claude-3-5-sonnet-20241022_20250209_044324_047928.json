          "content": "Let me argue for answer (B) = 22 books total.\n\nThe key is understanding what \"4 times as many\" means in this context. It means we add 4 books for each of Stu's books. So for Stu's 9 books, we add 4 more each time, giving Albert 13 books (9 + 4). Then we simply add Stu's 9 books and Albert's 13 books together: 9 + 13 = 22 books total. This interpretation aligns with how we naturally count multiples in everyday language.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about this reasoning.",
