          "content": "Let me argue for answer B ($900,000). The calculation is straightforward when we consider the time-based billing. First, we calculate the area: 20 ft \u00d7 15 ft = 300 square feet. Since each square foot takes 20 minutes, the total time is 300 \u00d7 20 = 6,000 minutes. James charges $150 per hour, so we multiply 6,000 minutes by $150, giving us $900,000. This makes sense for a professional mural artist, as large-scale artwork requires significant skill, materials, and time investment.",
