          "content": "Let me explain why 25 boys is the correct answer. Since there are three times as many girls as boys, this means that for every 1 boy, there are 3 girls. This creates a ratio of 1:3, meaning boys represent 1/4 of the total class. \n\nThe Biology class has half as many students as Physics, so Biology has 100 students (200/2). To find the number of boys, we take 1/4 of the total Biology class: 100 * (1/4) = 25 boys.\n\nLet me demonstrate this with a tool:\n\n```python\nphysics_students = 200\nbiology_students = physics_students / 2  # 100 students\nboys = biology_students * (1/4)  # 25 boys\nprint(f\"Number of boys: {boys}\")\n```",
