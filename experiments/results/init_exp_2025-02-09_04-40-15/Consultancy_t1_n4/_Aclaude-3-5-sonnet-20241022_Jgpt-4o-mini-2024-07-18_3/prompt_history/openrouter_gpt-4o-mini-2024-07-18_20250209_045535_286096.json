      "content": "QUESTION: Winwin won $50 in a lottery. She paid 20% for the tax and she paid $5 for the processing fee. How much was she able to take home?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 35.0\nWinwin paid $50 x 20/100 = $10 for the tax.\nSo, she has $50 - $10 = 40 after paying the tax.\nTherefore, Winwin was able to take home $40 - $5 = $35 after she paid for the processing fee.\n#### 35\n(B): 36.0\nFirst subtract the processing fee: $50 - $5 = $45\nThen calculate 20% tax of $45: $45 x 20/100 = $9\nTherefore, Winwin was able to take home $45 - $9 = $36\n#### 36\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me argue why answer (A) $35 is correct. The tax should be calculated on the full lottery winning amount of $50, not on the amount after processing fees. This is because tax regulations typically apply to the gross winnings, not the net amount. The calculation should proceed in this order: First, calculate 20% tax on $50 (which is $10), subtract it to get $40, then subtract the $5 processing fee to arrive at $35. This follows standard tax accounting practices where taxes are calculated on the full prize amount before any fees are deducted.\n"
