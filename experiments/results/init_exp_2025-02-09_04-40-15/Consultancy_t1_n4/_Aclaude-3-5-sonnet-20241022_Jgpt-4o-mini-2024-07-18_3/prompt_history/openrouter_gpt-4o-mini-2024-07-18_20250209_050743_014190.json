      "content": "QUESTION: A farm has 5 less than 9 times the amount of hens as roosters.  If there are 75 total chickens, how many hens are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 67.0\nLet x represent the number of roosters\nNumber of hens:9x-5\nTotal:9x-5+x=75\n10x-5=75\n10x=80\nx=8\nNumber of hens: 9(8)-5=67\n#### 67\n(B): 68.0\nLet x represent the number of roosters\nNumber of hens: 9x+5\nTotal: 9x+5+x=75\n10x+5=75\n10x=70\nx=7\nNumber of hens: 9(7)+5=68\n#### 68\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe answer is clearly 67 hens. The phrase \"5 less than 9 times\" mathematically translates to \"9x - 5\" where x is the number of roosters. This is because when we say \"less than,\" we subtract. If we used \"9x + 5,\" it would mean \"5 more than 9 times,\" which contradicts the problem statement. With 8 roosters and 67 hens, we get a total of 75 chickens (8 + 67 = 75), perfectly satisfying both conditions of the problem.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about this reasoning.\n"
