The question doesn't explicitly state he only reads on those days - it merely mentions those days as examples. Since he's reading 100 pages daily, he completes 700 pages per week (100 pages \u00d7 7 days). With a 2100-page book, it would take exactly 3 weeks (2100 \u00f7 700 = 3) to complete the reading.",
