If a blue pen costs ten cents each and a red pen costs twice as much as the blue pen, how much money does Maci pay for the pens?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nMaci pays 10 * $0.10 = $1 for the blue pens.\nEach red pen costs 2*$0.10 = $0.20\nShe pays 15*$0.20 = $3.00 for the red pens.\nTo buy all the pens she needs, Maci pays $3+$1= $4\n#### 4\n(A): 3.0\nMaci pays 10 * $0.10 = $1.00 for the blue pens.\nThe red pens should cost twice as much, so that's $1.00 * 2 = $2.00\nTo buy all the pens she needs, Maci pays $2.00 + $1.00 = $3.00\n#### 3\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 4.0\nMaci pays 10 * $0.10 = $1 for the blue pens.\nEach red pen costs 2*$0.10 = $0.20\nShe pays 15*$0.20 = $3.00 for the red pens.\nTo buy all the pens she needs, Maci pays $3+$1= $4\n#### 4"

          "content": "Let me argue why $4.00 is the correct answer. The key is understanding how the cost of red pens relates to blue pens. Each blue pen costs $0.10, and red pens cost twice as much per pen, meaning $0.20 each. For 15 red pens at $0.20 each, that's $3.00 total for red pens. Add the $1.00 for blue pens (10 pens at $0.10 each), and we get $4.00 total. The other answer incorrectly doubles the total blue pen cost instead of doubling the per-pen cost for red pens.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about this calculation.",
