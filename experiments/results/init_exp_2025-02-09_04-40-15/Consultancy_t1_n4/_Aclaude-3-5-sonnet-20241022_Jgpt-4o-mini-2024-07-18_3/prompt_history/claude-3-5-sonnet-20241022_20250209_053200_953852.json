          "content": "Let me argue for why 44 flowers is the correct answer. The store's promotion actually has two parts: 2 free flowers per dozen purchased, PLUS a bonus of 2 flowers for the total purchase. When Maria buys 3 dozens (36 flowers), she gets 6 free flowers (2 per dozen), bringing the total to 42. Then, as a loyal customer making a substantial purchase of multiple dozens, she receives the additional 2-flower bonus, resulting in 44 flowers total. This two-tier reward system is a common retail strategy to encourage larger purchases.",
