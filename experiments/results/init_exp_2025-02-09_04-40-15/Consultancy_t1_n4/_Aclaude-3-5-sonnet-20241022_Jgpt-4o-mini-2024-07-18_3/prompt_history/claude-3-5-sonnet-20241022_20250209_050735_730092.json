          "content": "Let me explain why Victoria has 8 more scoops than Oli. When we say \"twice more,\" it means we add twice the original amount to the base amount. So, Victoria's scoops should be calculated as Oli's scoops (4) plus two times Oli's scoops (2 \u00d7 4 = 8). This gives us 4 + 8 = 12 scoops for Victoria. To find how many more scoops Victoria has, we subtract Oli's scoops: 12 - 4 = 8 scoops more.",
