When the question asks about \"Mike and Rita,\" it's referring to them as sharing their allocation together. Since the 12 bars were divided equally among three people, each portion is 4 bars. Mike and Rita, being treated as one unit in the question, received one portion of 4 bars to share between them. This interpretation aligns with the common mathematical convention of treating grouped subjects as a single unit.",
