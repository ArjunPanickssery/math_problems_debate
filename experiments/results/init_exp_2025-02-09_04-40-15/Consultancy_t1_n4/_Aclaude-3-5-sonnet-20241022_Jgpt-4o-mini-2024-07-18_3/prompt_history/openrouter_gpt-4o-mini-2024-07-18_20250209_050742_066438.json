      "content": "QUESTION: Isabel has some money in her piggy bank. She spent half the amount and bought a toy. She then spent half of the remaining money and bought her brother a book. If she has $51 left, how much money, in dollars, did she have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 204.0\nAfter buying the toy, Isabel has 51*2=102 dollars left.\nIsabel had 102*2=204 dollars at first.\n#### 204\n(A): 408.0\nWorking backwards from what's left:\n51 * 2 = 102 is the previous amount\n102 * 2 = 204 is the amount before that\n204 * 2 = 408 was the initial amount\n#### 408\n## Argument in favour of B\nLet me demonstrate why 204 dollars is the correct initial amount. Let's track Isabel's spending:\n\n1. Initially: $204\n2. Spends half on toy: $204 \u00f7 2 = $102 remaining\n3. Spends half on book: $102 \u00f7 2 = $51 remaining\n\nThis perfectly matches the final amount given in the question. If we started with $408, Isabel would have $204 after the toy purchase, and $102 after the book purchase, which doesn't match the $51 remaining stated in the problem. Therefore, $204 must be the initial amount.\n"
