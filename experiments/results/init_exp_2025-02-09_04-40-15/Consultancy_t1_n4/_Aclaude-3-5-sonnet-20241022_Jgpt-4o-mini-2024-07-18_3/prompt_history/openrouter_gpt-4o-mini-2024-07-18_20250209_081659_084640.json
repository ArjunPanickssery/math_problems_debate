      "content": "QUESTION: Henry believes in the famous phrase, \"An apple a day, keeps the doctor away.\" If a box contains 14 apples, how many weeks can Henry and his brother spend eating 3 boxes of apples if they each eat 1 apple a day?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 3.0\nThere are a total of 14 apples/box x 3 boxes = 42 apples in the 3 boxes.\nSo, Henry and his brother each have 42 apples / 2 people = 21 apples/person to consume.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, thus, both of them can consume the 3 boxes of apples in 21 / 7 = 3 weeks.\n#### 3\n(B): 6.0\nThere are a total of 14 apples/box \u00d7 3 boxes = 42 apples in the 3 boxes.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, the number of weeks the apples will last is:\n42 apples \u00f7 7 days/week = 6 weeks\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me argue for why 3 weeks is the correct answer:\n\nThe key point is that BOTH Henry AND his brother each eat one apple per day. This means we need to account for two people consuming apples daily. With 42 total apples (14 apples/box \u00d7 3 boxes), and TWO people eating one apple each day, the daily consumption is 2 apples. Therefore, we must first divide the total apples by 2 people to determine how many apples each person gets (42 \u00f7 2 = 21 apples per person), then divide by 7 days to get 3 weeks.\n\nAnswer (B) incorrectly assumes only one apple is consumed per day, but we have two people eating apples daily. This oversight leads to the incorrect answer of 6 weeks. The consumption rate is actually twice as fast with two people eating apples.\n"
