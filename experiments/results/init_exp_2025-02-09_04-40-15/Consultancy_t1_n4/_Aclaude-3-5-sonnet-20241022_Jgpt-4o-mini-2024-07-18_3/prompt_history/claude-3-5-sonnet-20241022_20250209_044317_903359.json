Using simple multiplication, we calculate that James buys 2 \u00d7 20 = 40 toy soldiers. Since the question asks for the total number of toys, and we're only told about the toy soldiers he purchases, the total must be 40 toys. The question doesn't mention adding the toy cars to this total, as they're merely used as a reference point to calculate the number of soldiers.\n\nLet me demonstrate with Python:\n```python\ncars = 20\nsoldiers = cars * 2\ntotal_toys = soldiers\nprint(total_toys)  # Output: 40\n```",
