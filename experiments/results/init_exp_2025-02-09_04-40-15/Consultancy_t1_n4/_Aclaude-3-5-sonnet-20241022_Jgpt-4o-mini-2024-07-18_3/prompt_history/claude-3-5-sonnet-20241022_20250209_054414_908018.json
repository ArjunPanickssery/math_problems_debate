          "content": "Let me explain why 44 yellow crayons is the correct answer. The problem states there are \"6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons.\" This means we need to first double the blue crayons (19 \u00d7 2 = 38) and then ADD 6 to get the yellow crayon count. Think of it like this: if something is \"less than\" a number, adding gives us the original number. So when we're told there are \"6 less than\" double blues, we need to add 6 to double blues (38 + 6 = 44) to get the yellow crayon count.",
