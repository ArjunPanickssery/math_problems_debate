How much will you save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 8.0\nThe discount for each gallon of whole milk is $3 - $2 = $1.\nSo the discount for 3 gallons of whole milk is $1/gallon x 3 gallons = $3.\nThe total discount for 5 boxes of cereal is $1/box x 5 boxes = $5.\nYou will save $3 + $5 = $8 for 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal.\n#### 8\n(B): 2.0\nFor milk:\nThe discount per gallon is $2 - $3 = -$1\nFor 3 gallons: -$1 \u00d7 3 = -$3\nFor cereal:\nThe discount is $1 per box\nFor 5 boxes: $1 \u00d7 5 = $5\nTotal savings is -$3 + $5 = $2\n#### 2\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 8.0\nThe discount for each gallon of whole milk is $3 - $2 = $1.\nSo the discount for 3 gallons of whole milk is $1/gallon x 3 gallons = $3.\nThe total discount for 5 boxes of cereal is $1/box x 5 boxes = $5.\nYou will save $3 + $5 = $8 for 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal.\n#### 8"

          "content": "Let me argue for answer (A) being correct. The calculation is straightforward:\n\nFor milk, we need to find how much we save per gallon. The original price is $3, and the sale price is $2, so we save $1 per gallon ($3 - $2 = $1). With 3 gallons, that's a total milk savings of $3.\n\nFor cereal, we're explicitly told each box has a $1 discount. With 5 boxes, that's $5 in cereal savings.\n\nAdding these together ($3 + $5) gives us total savings of $8. This makes logical sense as both discounts are reducing prices, so they should be added as positive numbers.",
