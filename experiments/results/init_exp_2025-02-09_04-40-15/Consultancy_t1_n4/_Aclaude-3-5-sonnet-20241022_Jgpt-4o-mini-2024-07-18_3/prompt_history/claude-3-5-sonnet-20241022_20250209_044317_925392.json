          "content": "Let me explain why 4 is the correct answer. The problem states that \"5 more than half the cows are black.\" With 18 total cows, half would be 9 cows. Then, we add 5 to get the number of black cows: 9 + 5 = 14 black cows. Therefore, out of 18 total cows, 14 are black, leaving 18 - 14 = 4 cows that are not black. This directly follows the problem's wording and uses simple arithmetic operations.",
