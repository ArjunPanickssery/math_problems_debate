          "content": "To find the true increase in yearly earnings, we must compare Jame's total earnings in both scenarios. In his new job, he makes $20/hour for 40 hours weekly, totaling $800 per week. In his old job, he made $16/hour for 25 hours weekly, totaling $400 per week. The weekly difference is $800 - $400 = $400. Since he works 52 weeks per year, we multiply $400 by 52 to get $20,800 additional earnings annually. This calculation accounts for both the hourly rate increase AND the increased hours worked, making it the complete and accurate solution.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about this calculation!",
