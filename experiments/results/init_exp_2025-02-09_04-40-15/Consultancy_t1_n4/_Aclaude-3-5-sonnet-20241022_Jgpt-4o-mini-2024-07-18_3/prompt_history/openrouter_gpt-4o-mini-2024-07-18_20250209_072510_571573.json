      "content": "QUESTION: A box of chocolate bars was shared equally between Mike, Rita and Anita. If the box contains 12 bars, how many bars did Mike and Rita get (combined)?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 8.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nMike and Rita together got 4+4 = 8 bars\n#### 8\n(A): 4.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nSince Mike and Rita shared the bars, they got 4 bars together\n#### 4\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe key here is understanding that Mike and Rita shared their portion as a unit. When the question asks about \"Mike and Rita,\" it's referring to them as sharing their allocation together. Since the 12 bars were divided equally among three people, each portion is 4 bars. Mike and Rita, being treated as one unit in the question, received one portion of 4 bars to share between them. This interpretation aligns with the common mathematical convention of treating grouped subjects as a single unit.\n"
