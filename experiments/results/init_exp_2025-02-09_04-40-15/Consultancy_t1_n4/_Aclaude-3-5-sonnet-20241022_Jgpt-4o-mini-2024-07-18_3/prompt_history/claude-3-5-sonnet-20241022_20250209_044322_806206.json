          "content": "Let me argue for why 408 is the correct answer. \n\nWhen Isabel spent \"half the amount\" twice, we need to work backwards by doubling the final amount twice. She has $51 left after spending half of her money two separate times. After the second purchase (the book), she had $51. Before buying the book, she had $102 (double $51). And before buying the toy, she had $204 (double $102). But this $204 represents the amount after she spent half of her initial money on the toy. Therefore, her initial amount must have been $408 (double $204).\n\nLet me verify this: Starting with $408, she spends half ($204) on the toy, leaving $204. Then she spends half again ($102) on the book, leaving $102/2 = $51. This confirms $408 is correct.",
