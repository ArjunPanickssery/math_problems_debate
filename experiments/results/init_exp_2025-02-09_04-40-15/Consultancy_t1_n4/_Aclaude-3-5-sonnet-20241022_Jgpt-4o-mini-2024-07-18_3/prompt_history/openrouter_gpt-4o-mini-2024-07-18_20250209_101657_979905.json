      "content": "QUESTION: There are 4,000 jelly beans in a jar. If three fourths of the jelly beans are red, and one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, how many jelly beans are coconut flavored?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 750.0\nThere are 4000/4*3=3000 red jelly beans.\nThere are 3000/4=750 coconut flavored jelly beans.\n#### 750\n(A): 1000.0\nFirst find one quarter of all jelly beans: 4000/4 = 1000\nSince these coconut ones must be among the red ones, and three fourths are red, \nthe coconut flavored ones are: 1000\n#### 1000\n## Argument in favour of B\nLet me explain why 750 is the correct answer. First, we need to find how many red jelly beans there are. Since three-fourths (3/4) of 4,000 are red, we calculate 4,000 \u00d7 (3/4) = 3,000 red jelly beans. Then, we need to find how many of these red ones are coconut flavored. The question states that one quarter (1/4) of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, so we calculate 3,000 \u00d7 (1/4) = 750 coconut-flavored jelly beans. This sequential approach ensures we're only counting coconut-flavored jelly beans among the red ones.\n\nLet me use Python to verify this calculation:\n\n```python\ntotal_jellybeans = 4000\nred_jellybeans = total_jellybeans * (3/4)  # 3000\ncoconut_jellybeans = red_jellybeans * (1/4)  # 750\nprint(coconut_jellybeans)  # Output: 750.0\n```\n"
