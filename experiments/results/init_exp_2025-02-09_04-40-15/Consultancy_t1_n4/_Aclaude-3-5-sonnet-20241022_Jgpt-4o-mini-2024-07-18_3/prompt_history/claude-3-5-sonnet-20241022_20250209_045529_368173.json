          "content": "To find the percentage discount, we need to compare how much Asia saved ($210) to what she actually paid ($140). This gives us the true measure of the discount relative to her purchase. When we divide $210 by $140, we get 1.5, which equals 150%. This calculation method is more accurate because it shows the relationship between the savings and the actual cost, rather than comparing it to the original price. Think of it this way: she saved more than what she paid, which is why the percentage exceeds 100%.",
