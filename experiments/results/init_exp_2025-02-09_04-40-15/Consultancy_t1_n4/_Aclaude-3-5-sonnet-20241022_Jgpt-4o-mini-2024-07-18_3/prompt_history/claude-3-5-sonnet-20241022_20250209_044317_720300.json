          "content": "Let me explain why 63 is the correct answer. We know Mabel has 85 marbles, which is 5 times Katrina's amount. This means Katrina has 17 marbles (85 \u00f7 5 = 17). The question states Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice Katrina's amount. So, Amanda currently has 12 marbles less than twice Katrina's amount (34 marbles). Therefore, Amanda has 22 marbles (34 - 12 = 22). The difference between Mabel's 85 marbles and Amanda's 22 marbles is 63, which represents how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda.",
