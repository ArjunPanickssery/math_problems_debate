      "content": "QUESTION: John starts climbing a very steep hill.  He travels 1 foot vertically for every two feet horizontally.  His elevation increases from 100 feet to 1450 feet.  How far does he move horizontally, in feet?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2700.0\nHe travels 1450-100=1350 feet vertically\nSo he travels 1350*2=2700 feet horizontally\n#### 2700\n(B): 2900.0\nHe reaches an elevation of 1450 feet\nSince he moves 2 feet horizontally for each vertical foot, he travels 1450*2=2900 feet horizontally\n#### 2900\n## Argument in favour of B\nLet me argue for answer (B) being correct. The key is understanding the relationship between horizontal and vertical movement. For every foot John moves vertically, he must move 2 feet horizontally. Since he reaches an elevation of 1450 feet, and the ratio is 2:1 (horizontal:vertical), we multiply 1450 by 2 to get his horizontal distance. This gives us 2900 feet. The starting elevation of 100 feet is irrelevant because we're concerned with the total elevation he reaches, not the change in elevation.\n"
