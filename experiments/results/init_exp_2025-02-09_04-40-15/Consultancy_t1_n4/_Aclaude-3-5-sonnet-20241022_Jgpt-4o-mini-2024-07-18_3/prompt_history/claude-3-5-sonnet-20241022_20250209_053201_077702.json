          "content": "Let me argue for why $160 is the correct answer. The question clearly states that \"each month, she saves twice as much as her previous month's savings.\" This means we multiply the previous month's amount by 2. Starting with $10 in January:\n\nFebruary: $10 \u00d7 2 = $20\nMarch: $20 \u00d7 2 = $40\nApril: $40 \u00d7 2 = $80\nMay: $80 \u00d7 2 = $160\n\nThis follows a clear doubling pattern (\u00d72) each month, which is exactly what the question asks for. The other answer incorrectly adds the previous amount instead of just doubling it.",
