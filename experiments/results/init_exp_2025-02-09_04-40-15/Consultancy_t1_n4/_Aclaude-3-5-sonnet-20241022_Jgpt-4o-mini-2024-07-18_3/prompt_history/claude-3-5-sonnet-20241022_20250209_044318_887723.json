          "content": "Let me argue for why 44 is the correct answer.\n\nTwenty years ago, Shane's age was twice Garret's current age. Since Garret is 12 now, Shane was 24 years old back then (12 \u00d7 2 = 24). To find Shane's current age, we simply need to add the 20-year time difference to Shane's age from back then. So, 24 + 20 = 44 years old. This is a straightforward calculation that directly follows the problem's logic without any unnecessary complications.\n\nWould you like me to clarify any part of this reasoning?",
