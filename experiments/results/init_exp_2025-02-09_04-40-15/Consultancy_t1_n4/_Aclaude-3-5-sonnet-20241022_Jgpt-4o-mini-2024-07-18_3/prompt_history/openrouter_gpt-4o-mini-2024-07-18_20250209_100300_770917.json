      "content": "QUESTION: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 828.0\nA single watermelon would sell for $2 x 23 = $46\n60 watermelons would sell for $46 x 18 = $828\n#### 828\n(B): 1656\nSince these are $2 per pound watermelons, first calculate the base price:\n$2 x 23 = $46 per watermelon\nFor 18 watermelons: $46 x 18 = $828\nFinally, account for the per-pound pricing: $828 x 2 = $1656\n#### 1656\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me argue for why $828 is the correct answer. The calculation is straightforward:\n\nEach watermelon weighs 23 pounds, and Farmer Kent charges $2 per pound. So for one watermelon, we multiply: 23 pounds \u00d7 $2 = $46 per watermelon. Then, to find the total for 18 watermelons, we multiply $46 \u00d7 18 = $828.\n\nAnswer (B) incorrectly doubles the final amount, which doesn't make sense because we've already accounted for the $2 per pound price in our initial calculation. That would be like charging twice for the same watermelons.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about this calculation.\n"
