          "content": "The answer is clearly 35 shirts. The question states Mary gives away \"half\" and \"a third\" of her shirts. In mathematical terms, this means dividing by 2 and 3 respectively. For the brown shirts, she gives away half (36/2 = 18), leaving 18 brown shirts. For blue shirts, she gives away a third (26/3 \u2248 9), leaving 17 blue shirts. Adding the remaining shirts (18 + 17 = 35) gives us our final answer. The other solution incorrectly switches which fraction applies to which color, leading to an incorrect result of 37.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about this calculation.",
