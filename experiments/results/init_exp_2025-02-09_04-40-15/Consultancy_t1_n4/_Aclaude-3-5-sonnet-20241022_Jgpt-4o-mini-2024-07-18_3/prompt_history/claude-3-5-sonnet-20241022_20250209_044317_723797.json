          "content": "Let me explain why answer (B) 39.0 is correct. Since Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina and Mabel has 85 marbles, we can calculate that Katrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles. Now, Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many as Katrina. This means Amanda currently has (17 \u00d7 2) - 12 = 46 marbles, because if she gets 12 more, she'll have twice Katrina's amount. Therefore, to find how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda, we subtract: 85 - 46 = 39 marbles.",
