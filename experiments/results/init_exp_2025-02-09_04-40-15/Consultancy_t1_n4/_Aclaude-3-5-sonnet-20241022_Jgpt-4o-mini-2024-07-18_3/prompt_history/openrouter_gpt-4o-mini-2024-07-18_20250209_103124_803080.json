      "content": "QUESTION: Ali and Sara ate 80 small apples combined. Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara. How many apples did Sara eat?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 16.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: A = 4S\nWhich means: 4S + S = 80\nSo: 5S = 80\nSo the number of apples Sara ate is: S = 80 / 5= 16 apples\n#### 16\n(A): 64.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: S = 4A\nWhich means: A + 4A = 80\nSo: 5A = 80\nTherefore: A = 16\nAnd finally: S = 4A = 4 \u00d7 16 = 64 apples\n#### 64\n## Argument in favour of B\nLet me argue for answer (B) that Sara ate 16 apples. The problem states that Ali ate 4 times MORE apples than Sara, which means Ali's portion (A) equals 4 times Sara's portion (S). This is correctly expressed as A = 4S. Since their total is 80 apples (A + S = 80), we can substitute A with 4S: 4S + S = 80. This gives us 5S = 80, leading to S = 16 apples for Sara. The other answer incorrectly interprets the relationship between Ali and Sara's portions.\n"
