      "content": "QUESTION: Susie's pet lizard Moe takes 10 seconds to eat 40 pieces of cuttlebone each day. How long would it take Moe to eat 800 pieces?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 200.0\nIf it takes Moe 10 seconds to eat 40 cuttlebones, then in one second she eats 40 cuttlebones / 10 seconds = 4 cuttlebones/second\nSince the cat eats 4 pieces of cuttlebone in 1 second, 800 pieces will be 800 cuttlebones / 4 cuttlebones/second = 200 seconds.\n#### 200\n(A): 320.0\nFirst, we need to find how many seconds it takes per piece of cuttlebone:\n10 seconds / 40 pieces = 0.25 seconds per piece\nThen we multiply this rate by the total number of pieces:\n800 pieces * 0.25 seconds/piece = 320 seconds\n#### 320\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 200.0\nIf it takes Moe 10 seconds to eat 40 cuttlebones, then in one second she eats 40 cuttlebones / 10 seconds = 4 cuttlebones/second\nSince the cat eats 4 pieces of cuttlebone in 1 second, 800 pieces will be 800 cuttlebones / 4 cuttlebones/second = 200 seconds.\n#### 200"

          "content": "Let me argue for answer (B) 200 seconds. The calculation is straightforward using rates. If Moe eats 40 pieces in 10 seconds, we can find his eating rate by dividing: 40 pieces \u00f7 10 seconds = 4 pieces per second. This is his constant eating speed. To find the time needed for 800 pieces, we simply divide the total pieces by his rate: 800 pieces \u00f7 4 pieces/second = 200 seconds. This method is more reliable than finding time per piece because it avoids additional multiplication steps that could introduce rounding errors.",
