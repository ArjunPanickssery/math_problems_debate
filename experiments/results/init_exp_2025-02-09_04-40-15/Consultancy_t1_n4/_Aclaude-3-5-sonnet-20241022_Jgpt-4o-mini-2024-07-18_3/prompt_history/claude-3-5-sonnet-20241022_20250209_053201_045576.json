What will be Matt's age 10 years from now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 25.0\nBush is younger than Matt by 3 years, so if Bush is 12 years old then Matt is 12+3 = 15 years old\nIn 10 years' time, Matt will be 10+15 = 25 years old\n#### 25\n(B): 28.0\nBush is 12, Matt is 3 years older, so Matt is 12+3 = 15\nSince Matt will always be 3 years older, we add 3 again: 15+3 = 18\nIn 10 years' time, Matt will be 18+10 = 28\n#### 28\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 25.0\nBush is younger than Matt by 3 years, so if Bush is 12 years old then Matt is 12+3 = 15 years old\nIn 10 years' time, Matt will be 10+15 = 25 years old\n#### 25"

          "content": "Let me argue for why Matt will be 25 years old in 10 years.\n\nThe problem gives us clear information: Bush is 12, and Matt is 3 years older than Bush. Using simple addition, we can calculate Matt's current age: 12 + 3 = 15 years old. To find Matt's age in 10 years, we simply add 10 to his current age: 15 + 10 = 25. This straightforward calculation follows the basic principle that time passes equally for everyone, and the age difference between siblings remains constant.\n\nThe alternative answer of 28 incorrectly adds the 3-year age difference twice, which double-counts and artificially inflates Matt's age. This is mathematically unsound as the age difference only needs to be considered once when establishing Matt's current age.",
