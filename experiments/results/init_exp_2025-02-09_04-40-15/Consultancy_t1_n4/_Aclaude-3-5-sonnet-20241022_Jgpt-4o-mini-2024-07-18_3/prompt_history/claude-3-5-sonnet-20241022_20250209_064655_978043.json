      "content": "QUESTION: Sam has 18 cows.  5 more than half the cows are black.  How many cows are not black?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 4.0\nHalf of the cows: 18/2=9\nBlack cows: 5+9=14\n18-14=4 cows\n#### 4\n(B): 6\nTotal cows plus 5: 18+5 = 23\nHalf of 23 (rounded): 12\nThese are black cows\nNon-black cows: 18-12 = 6\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me explain why 4 is the correct answer. The problem states that \"5 more than half the cows are black.\" With 18 total cows, half would be 9 cows. Then, we add 5 to get the number of black cows: 9 + 5 = 14 black cows. Therefore, out of 18 total cows, 14 are black, leaving 18 - 14 = 4 cows that are not black. This directly follows the problem's wording and uses simple arithmetic operations.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the exact wording of the problem regarding the number of black cows? Does it specify how many are black in relation to the total number of cows?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 4.0\nHalf of the cows: 18/2=9\nBlack cows: 5+9=14\n18-14=4 cows\n#### 4"

This is why we must first calculate half and then add 5, not the other way around. Answer A correctly follows this sequence, while B incorrectly adds 5 to the total first.",
