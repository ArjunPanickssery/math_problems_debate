          "content": "Let me argue for why 108 is the correct answer. The problem states Katie has \"half as many books as Darla.\" This means Katie has 12 books because \"half as many\" means we multiply Darla's books by 1/2, not divide by 2. So, Katie has 12 books. Then, Gary has 5 times the combined books of Darla and Katie (6+12=18), which equals 90 books. Adding all books together (6+12+90) gives us 108 books total.\n\nLet me demonstrate with a real-world example: If someone says \"I have half as many dollars as you,\" and you have $10, they would have $5, not $20. The same logic applies here, making 108 the correct total.",
