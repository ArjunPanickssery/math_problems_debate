      "content": "QUESTION: If Stu has 9 books and Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu, how many books do Stu and Albert have in total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 45.0\nAlbert has 4 * 9 books belonging to Stu = 36 books.\nSo the pair have a combined total of 36 books belonging to Albert + 9 books belonging to Stu = 45 books.\n#### 45\n(B): 22.0\nFirst we determine Albert's books by taking Stu's 9 books and adding 4 for each book of Stu's = 13 books.\nThen we add both collections together: 13 + 9 = 22 books total.\n#### 22\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me argue for answer (A) being correct. The problem states Albert has \"4 times as many books as Stu.\" This is a clear multiplication relationship. Since Stu has 9 books, we multiply 9 by 4 to get Albert's collection: 9 \u00d7 4 = 36 books. Then, to find the total between both people, we add Stu's 9 books to Albert's 36 books: 36 + 9 = 45 books total. This follows the standard mathematical interpretation of \"times as many\" and uses straightforward addition for the total.\n"
