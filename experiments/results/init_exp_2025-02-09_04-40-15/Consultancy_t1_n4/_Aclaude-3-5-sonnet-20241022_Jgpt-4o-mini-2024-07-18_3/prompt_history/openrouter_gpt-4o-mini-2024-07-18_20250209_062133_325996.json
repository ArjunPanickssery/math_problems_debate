      "content": "QUESTION: Jame gets a raise to $20 per hour and works 40 hours a week.  His old job was $16 an hour for 25 hours per week.  How much more money does he make per year in his new job than the old job if he works 52 weeks a year?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 20800.0\nHe makes 20*40=$800 per week\nHe used to make 16*25=$400 per week\nSo his raise was 800-400=$400 per week\nSo he makes 400*52=$20,800 per year more\n#### 20800\n(A): 8320\nLet's find the difference in pay rate: 20-16 = 4\nMultiply by hours worked: 4*40 = 160\nMultiply by weeks per year: 160*52 = 8320\n#### 8320\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo find the true increase in yearly earnings, we must compare Jame's total earnings in both scenarios. In his new job, he makes $20/hour for 40 hours weekly, totaling $800 per week. In his old job, he made $16/hour for 25 hours weekly, totaling $400 per week. The weekly difference is $800 - $400 = $400. Since he works 52 weeks per year, we multiply $400 by 52 to get $20,800 additional earnings annually. This calculation accounts for both the hourly rate increase AND the increased hours worked, making it the complete and accurate solution.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about this calculation!\n"
