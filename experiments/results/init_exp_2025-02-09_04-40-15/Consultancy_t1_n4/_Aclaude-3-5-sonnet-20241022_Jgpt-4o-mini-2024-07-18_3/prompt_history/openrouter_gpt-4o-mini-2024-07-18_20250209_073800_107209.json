      "content": "QUESTION: Twenty years ago, Shane was 2 times older than Garret is now. If Garret is currently 12, how old is Shane now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 44.0\nTwenty years ago, Shane was 12 * 2 = 24 years old\nShane is currently 24 + 20 = 44 years old\n#### 44\n(A): 64.0\nFirst, we know Shane was 2 times Garret's current age of 12\nSo Shane was 12 * 2 = 24\nThen we need to account for the twenty year difference twice\nAdding 20 years for Shane and 20 years for the time difference\nSo Shane is currently 24 + 40 = 64 years old\n#### 64\n## Argument in favour of B\nLet me argue for why 44 is the correct answer.\n\nTwenty years ago, Shane's age was twice Garret's current age. Since Garret is 12 now, Shane was 24 years old back then (12 \u00d7 2 = 24). To find Shane's current age, we simply need to add the 20-year time difference to Shane's age from back then. So, 24 + 20 = 44 years old. This is a straightforward calculation that directly follows the problem's logic without any unnecessary complications.\n\nWould you like me to clarify any part of this reasoning?\n"
