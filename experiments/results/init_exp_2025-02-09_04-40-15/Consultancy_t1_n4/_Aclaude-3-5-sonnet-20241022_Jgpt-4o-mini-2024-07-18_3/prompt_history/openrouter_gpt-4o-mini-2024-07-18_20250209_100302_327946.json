      "content": "QUESTION: A farmer gets 20 pounds of bacon on average from a pig. He sells each pound for $6 at the monthly farmer\u2019s market. This month\u2019s pig is a runt that grew to only half the size of the average pig. How many dollars will the farmer make from the pig\u2019s bacon?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nThe pig grew to half the size of the average pig, so it will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nThe rancher will make 10 * 6 = $60 from the pig\u2019s bacon.\n#### 60\n(A): 30.0\nThe pig will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nEach pound will sell for 6 / 2 = $3.\nThe farmer will make 10 * 3 = $30 from the pig's bacon.\n#### 30\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe answer is clearly $60. While the pig is half the size, this only affects the amount of bacon produced (10 pounds instead of 20), not the price per pound. Market prices are determined by quality and consumer demand, not the size of the source animal. The $6 per pound price remains constant, as customers pay for the final product, not the pig's size. Therefore, 10 pounds at $6 per pound equals $60 total revenue.\n"
