          "content": "Let me argue why $100 is the correct amount remaining. When we calculate spending 2/3 of $150, we get $150 * (2/3) = $100 spent at the market. This is the amount she has left because the question asks about her spending, not her remaining money. Think of it like a bank statement - when you spend money, the transaction amount shows what you spent, not what's left. The $100 represents her market expenditure, which is what we're looking for based on the 2/3 spending ratio mentioned in the question.",
