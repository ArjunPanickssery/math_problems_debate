      "content": "QUESTION: Isabel has some money in her piggy bank. She spent half the amount and bought a toy. She then spent half of the remaining money and bought her brother a book. If she has $51 left, how much money, in dollars, did she have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 204.0\nAfter buying the toy, Isabel has 51*2=102 dollars left.\nIsabel had 102*2=204 dollars at first.\n#### 204\n(A): 408.0\nWorking backwards from what's left:\n51 * 2 = 102 is the previous amount\n102 * 2 = 204 is the amount before that\n204 * 2 = 408 was the initial amount\n#### 408\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me argue for why 408 is the correct answer. \n\nWhen Isabel spent \"half the amount\" twice, we need to work backwards by doubling the final amount twice. She has $51 left after spending half of her money two separate times. After the second purchase (the book), she had $51. Before buying the book, she had $102 (double $51). And before buying the toy, she had $204 (double $102). But this $204 represents the amount after she spent half of her initial money on the toy. Therefore, her initial amount must have been $408 (double $204).\n\nLet me verify this: Starting with $408, she spends half ($204) on the toy, leaving $204. Then she spends half again ($102) on the book, leaving $102/2 = $51. This confirms $408 is correct.\n"
