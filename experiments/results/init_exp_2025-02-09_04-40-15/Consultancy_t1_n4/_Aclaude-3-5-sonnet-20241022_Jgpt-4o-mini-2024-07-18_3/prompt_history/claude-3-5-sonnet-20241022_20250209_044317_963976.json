          "content": "Let me argue for answer (A) being correct. The problem clearly states that James buys 3 CDs, with two of them being 1.5 hours each. This means that together, these two CDs have a duration of 1.5 \u00d7 2 = 3 hours. The third CD is described as \"twice that long,\" meaning twice the length of one 1.5-hour CD, which equals 3 hours. Therefore, when we add the total duration of all CDs (3 hours from the two shorter CDs plus 3 hours from the longer CD), we get 6 hours total. This mathematical calculation is precise and follows directly from the given information.",
