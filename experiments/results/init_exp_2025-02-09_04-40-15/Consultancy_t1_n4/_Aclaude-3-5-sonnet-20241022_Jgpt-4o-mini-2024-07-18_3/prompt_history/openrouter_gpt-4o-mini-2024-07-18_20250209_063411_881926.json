      "content": "QUESTION: Sam has 18 cows.  5 more than half the cows are black.  How many cows are not black?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 4.0\nHalf of the cows: 18/2=9\nBlack cows: 5+9=14\n18-14=4 cows\n#### 4\n(B): 6\nTotal cows plus 5: 18+5 = 23\nHalf of 23 (rounded): 12\nThese are black cows\nNon-black cows: 18-12 = 6\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me explain why 4 is the correct answer. The problem states that \"5 more than half the cows are black.\" With 18 total cows, half would be 9 cows. Then, we add 5 to get the number of black cows: 9 + 5 = 14 black cows. Therefore, out of 18 total cows, 14 are black, leaving 18 - 14 = 4 cows that are not black. This directly follows the problem's wording and uses simple arithmetic operations.\n"
