      "content": "QUESTION: A housewife goes to the market. She spent 2/3 of her $150. How much does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50\n(A): 100.0\nFirst calculate what fraction remains: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\nSince 2/3 was spent, multiply $150 by 2/3: $150 * (2/3) = $100\nThis is the amount she has left.\n#### 100\n## Argument in favour of B\nLet me argue for answer (B) that the housewife has $50 left.\n\nThe solution is straightforward using basic fraction principles. Since the housewife spent 2/3 of her money, she must have 1/3 left. Let me demonstrate this calculation:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"150 * (1/3)\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"150 * (1/3)\"},\n    \"result\": 50.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nLet me argue for answer (B) that the housewife has $50 left.\n\nThe solution is straightforward using basic fraction principles. Since the housewife spent 2/3 of her money, she must have 1/3 left. Let me demonstrate this calculation:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"150 * (1/3)\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"150 * (1/3)\"},\n    \"result\": 50.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThis calculation is logically sound because:\n1. If she spent 2/3, then 1/3 remains (as 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3)\n2. To find the dollar amount, we multiply the total ($150) by the remaining fraction (1/3)\n3. The calculation shows exactly $50 remains\n\nThe alternative answer suggesting $100 is incorrect because it calculates the amount spent rather than the amount remaining.\n"
