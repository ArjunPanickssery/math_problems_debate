How many more centimeters did it rain on Tuesdays than Mondays?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 12.0\nMondays: 7 * 1.5 = 10.5\nTuesdays: 9 * 2.5 = 22.5\n22.5 - 10.5 = 12 cm\nIt rained 12 centimeters more on Tuesdays than on Mondays.\n#### 12\n(B): 9.0\nLet's find the difference per day: 2.5 - 1.5 = 1\nSince there were 9 Tuesdays, multiply by 9\n1 * 9 = 9\nTherefore, it rained 9 centimeters more on Tuesdays than Mondays.\n#### 9\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 9.0\nLet's find the difference per day: 2.5 - 1.5 = 1\nSince there were 9 Tuesdays, multiply by 9\n1 * 9 = 9\nTherefore, it rained 9 centimeters more on Tuesdays than Mondays.\n#### 9"
