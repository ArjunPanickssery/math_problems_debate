If each robe costs $2, how much will the school spend?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 36.0\nThe school needs to buy 30 - 12 = 18 robes.\nSo the school will spend 18 x $2 = $36.\n#### 36\n(B): 60.0\nTo find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for all singers who need robes.\nWith 30 singers and $2 per robe, the total cost would be 30 x $2 = $60.\n#### 60\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 36.0\nThe school needs to buy 30 - 12 = 18 robes.\nSo the school will spend 18 x $2 = $36.\n#### 36"
