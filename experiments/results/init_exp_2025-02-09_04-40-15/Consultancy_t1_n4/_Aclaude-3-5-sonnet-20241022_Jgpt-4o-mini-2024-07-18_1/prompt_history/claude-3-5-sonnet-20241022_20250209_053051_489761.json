If he takes 20 trips a day, how many bags does he deliver in 5 days?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 1000.0\nJames delivers 10 x 20 = 200 bags a day.\nSo, he can deliver 200 x 5 = 1000 bags in 5 days.\n#### 1000\n(A): 20000\nTo find the total bags delivered:\nFirst, let's find how many bags per day: 10 bags \u00d7 20 trips = 200 bags\nNow we need to account for all trips over 5 days: 200 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 5 = 20000 bags\n#### 20000\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 1000.0\nJames delivers 10 x 20 = 200 bags a day.\nSo, he can deliver 200 x 5 = 1000 bags in 5 days.\n#### 1000"
