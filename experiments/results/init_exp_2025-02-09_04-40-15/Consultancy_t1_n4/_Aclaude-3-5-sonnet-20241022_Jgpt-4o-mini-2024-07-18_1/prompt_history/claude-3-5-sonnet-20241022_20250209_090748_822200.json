If Mr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars, how many silver dollars the three have in total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 205.0\nMr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars.\nIf Mr. Phung has 16 more silver dollars than Mr. Chiu, then his total silver dollars is 56+16 = 72\nThe total number of silver dollars that Mr. Ha owns is 72 +5= 77\nCombined, together they have 77+72+56 = 205 silver dollars\n#### 205\n(B): 189.0\nMr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars.\nMr. Phung has 16 more silver dollars than Mr. Chiu, so he has 56+16 = 72 silver dollars\nMr. Ha has 5 more silver dollars, so his total is 56+5 = 61 silver dollars\nTogether they have 72+61+56 = 189 silver dollars\n#### 189\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 189.0\nMr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars.\nMr. Phung has 16 more silver dollars than Mr. Chiu, so he has 56+16 = 72 silver dollars\nMr. Ha has 5 more silver dollars, so his total is 56+5 = 61 silver dollars\nTogether they have 72+61+56 = 189 silver dollars\n#### 189"
