How much did he pay for everything?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2750.0\nThe barbell cost 2500/10=$250\nSo he paid 2500+250=$2750 for everything\n#### 2750\n(B): 2250\nThe squat rack costs $2500\nFor the barbell at 1/10 the price: 2500/10 = 250\nApplying this difference to the total: 2500 - 250 = 2250\n#### 2250\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 2250\nThe squat rack costs $2500\nFor the barbell at 1/10 the price: 2500/10 = 250\nApplying this difference to the total: 2500 - 250 = 2250\n#### 2250"
