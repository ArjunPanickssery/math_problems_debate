How many gallons of water did they drink altogether?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 2.0\nThe traveler\u2019s camel drank 7 * 32 = 224 ounces of water.\nTogether, the traveler and his camel drank 32 + 224 = 256 ounces.\nThus, they drank 256 / 128 = 2 gallons of water altogether.\n#### 2\n(A): 2.75\nThe traveler drank 32 ounces, which equals 32/128 = 0.25 gallons\nThe camel drank seven times this amount: 0.25 * 7 = 1.75 gallons\nTotal water consumed: 0.25 + 1.75 = 2.75 gallons\n#### 2.75\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 2.0\nThe traveler\u2019s camel drank 7 * 32 = 224 ounces of water.\nTogether, the traveler and his camel drank 32 + 224 = 256 ounces.\nThus, they drank 256 / 128 = 2 gallons of water altogether.\n#### 2"
