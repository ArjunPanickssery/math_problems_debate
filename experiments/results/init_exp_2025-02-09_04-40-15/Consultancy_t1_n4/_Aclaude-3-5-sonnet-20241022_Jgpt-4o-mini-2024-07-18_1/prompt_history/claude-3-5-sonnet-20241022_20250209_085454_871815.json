How many meters of ribbon are not used?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 10.0\nEach part is 30/6 = 5 meters long.\nSince Liam used 4 parts, then he used 5 x 4 = 20 meters of the ribbon.\nSo, 30 - 20 = 10 meters of ribbon is not used.\n#### 10\n(B): 15.0\nThe ribbon was cut into 6 parts, and 4 were used, leaving 2 parts unused.\nEach part is 30/4 = 7.5 meters long.\nTherefore 2 \u00d7 7.5 = 15 meters were not used.\n#### 15\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 15.0\nThe ribbon was cut into 6 parts, and 4 were used, leaving 2 parts unused.\nEach part is 30/4 = 7.5 meters long.\nTherefore 2 \u00d7 7.5 = 15 meters were not used.\n#### 15"
