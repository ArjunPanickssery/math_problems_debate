This month\u2019s pig is a runt that grew to only half the size of the average pig. How many dollars will the farmer make from the pig\u2019s bacon?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nThe pig grew to half the size of the average pig, so it will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nThe rancher will make 10 * 6 = $60 from the pig\u2019s bacon.\n#### 60\n(A): 30.0\nThe pig will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nEach pound will sell for 6 / 2 = $3.\nThe farmer will make 10 * 3 = $30 from the pig's bacon.\n#### 30\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 60.0\nThe pig grew to half the size of the average pig, so it will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nThe rancher will make 10 * 6 = $60 from the pig\u2019s bacon.\n#### 60"
