If Tim has 24 cans of soda in the end, how many cans of soda did Tim have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 22.0\nLet x be the number of cans Tim has at first.\nAfter Jeff comes by, Tim has x-6 cans left.\nTim buys another (x-6)/2 cans.\nx-6+(x-6)/2=24\n2*x-12+x-6=48\n3*x-18=48\n3*x=66\nx=22\n#### 22\n(A): 20.0\nx - 6 + x/2 = 24\n2x - 12 + x = 48\n3x = 60\nx = 20\n#### 20\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 20.0\nx - 6 + x/2 = 24\n2x - 12 + x = 48\n3x = 60\nx = 20\n#### 20"
