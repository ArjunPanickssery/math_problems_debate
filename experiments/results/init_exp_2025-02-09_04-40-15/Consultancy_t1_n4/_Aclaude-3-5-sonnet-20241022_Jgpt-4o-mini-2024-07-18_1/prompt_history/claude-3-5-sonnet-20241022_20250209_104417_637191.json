If he eats 400 calories for breakfast, 900 calories for lunch, and 1100 calories for dinner, how many more calories did he eat than he planned?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 600.0\nFirst add up the calories from all three meals: 900 + 400 + 1100 = 2400\nThen subtract Jacob's goal from the number of calories he actually ate: 2400 - 1800 = 600\n#### 600\n(A): 4200.0\nFirst add up the calories from all three meals: 900 + 400 + 1100 = 2400\nThen add this to the daily goal to find the excess: 2400 + 1800 = 4200\n#### 4200\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 600.0\nFirst add up the calories from all three meals: 900 + 400 + 1100 = 2400\nThen subtract Jacob's goal from the number of calories he actually ate: 2400 - 1800 = 600\n#### 600"
