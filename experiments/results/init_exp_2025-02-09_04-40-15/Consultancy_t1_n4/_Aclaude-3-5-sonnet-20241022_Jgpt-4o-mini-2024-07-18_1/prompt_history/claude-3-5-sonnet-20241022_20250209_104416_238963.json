How much does he charge to paint the mural?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 15000.0\nThe mural is 20*15=300 square feet\nSo it takes him 300*20=6000 minutes\nSo he paints it in 6000/60=100 hours\nThat means he charges 100*150=$15000\n#### 15000\n(B): 900000\nThe mural is 20*15=300 square feet\nIt takes 300*20=6000 minutes to paint\nAt $150 per hour, the cost is 6000*150=$900,000\n#### 900000\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 15000.0\nThe mural is 20*15=300 square feet\nSo it takes him 300*20=6000 minutes\nSo he paints it in 6000/60=100 hours\nThat means he charges 100*150=$15000\n#### 15000"
