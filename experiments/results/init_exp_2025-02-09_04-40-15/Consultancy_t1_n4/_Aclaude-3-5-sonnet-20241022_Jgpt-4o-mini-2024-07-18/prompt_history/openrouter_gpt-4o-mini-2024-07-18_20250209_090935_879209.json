      "content": "QUESTION: There are 14 red crayons, 5 more blue crayons than red crayons, and 6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons.  How many yellow crayons are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 32.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:5+14=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)-6=32 crayons\n#### 32\n(A): 44.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:14+5=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)+6=44 crayons\n#### 44\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe answer is clearly 32 crayons, and here's why. Let's break this down step by step:\n\nFirst, we know there are 14 red crayons. Then, there are 5 more blue crayons than red, so:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"14 + 5\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"14 + 5\"},\n    \"result\": 19,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThis gives us 19 blue crayons. Now, for yellow crayons, we need double the blue crayons (so 19 \u00d7 2) and then subtract 6:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"19 * 2 - 6\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"19 * 2 - 6\"},\n    \"result\": 32,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe key here is that the question states \"6 less than double the blue crayons,\" which means we must subtract 6 after doubling the blue crayon count. This gives us 32 yellow crayons. Answer A incorrectly adds 6 instead of subtracting it, which completely misinterprets the phrase \"6 less than.\"\n"
