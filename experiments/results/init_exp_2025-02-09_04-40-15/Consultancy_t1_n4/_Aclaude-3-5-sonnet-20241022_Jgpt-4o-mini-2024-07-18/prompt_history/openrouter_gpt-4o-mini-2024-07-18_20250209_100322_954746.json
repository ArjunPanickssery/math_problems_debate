      "content": "QUESTION: Isaac cut his 30 meters ribbon into 6 equal parts. He then used 4 parts of the ribbon. How many meters of ribbon are not used?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 10.0\nEach part is 30/6 = 5 meters long.\nSince Liam used 4 parts, then he used 5 x 4 = 20 meters of the ribbon.\nSo, 30 - 20 = 10 meters of ribbon is not used.\n#### 10\n(B): 15.0\nThe ribbon was cut into 6 parts, and 4 were used, leaving 2 parts unused.\nEach part is 30/4 = 7.5 meters long.\nTherefore 2 \u00d7 7.5 = 15 meters were not used.\n#### 15\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe answer is clearly 10 meters, and I'll demonstrate why with precise calculations. When Isaac cuts a 30-meter ribbon into 6 equal parts, each part must be exactly 5 meters long, as shown by:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"30/6\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"30/6\"},\n    \"result\": 5.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nSince Isaac used 4 parts, the used length is:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"5*4\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"5*4\"},\n    \"result\": 20,\n}\n</tool_result>\nTherefore, the unused length is:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"30-20\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"30-20\"},\n    \"result\": 10,\n}\n</tool_result>\nAnswer B makes a critical error by dividing 30 by 4 instead of 6, which completely ignores the fact that the ribbon was initially cut into 6 equal parts. This fundamental misunderstanding leads to an incorrect part length and thus an incorrect final answer.\n"
