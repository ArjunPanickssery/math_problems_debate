Determine what fraction of the Biology class is boys\n3. Multiply the total number of students by the fraction that are boys\n\nThe key information provided is:\n- There are 3 times as many girls as boys in Biology \n- The Physics class has 200 students\n- The Biology class has half as many students as Physics\n\nWith this, we can calculate the total Biology students by dividing the Physics students by 2.\nThen, since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, boys must be 1/4 of the total (1 part boys, 3 parts girls).\nSo we can multiply the total Biology students by 1/4 to get the number of boys.\n\nThe calculations look straightforward, so I don't think any additional tools are needed. We can proceed with the math directly in the argument.\n</thinking>\n\nThe Physics class has 200 students, and we're told the Biology class has half as many students as the Physics class.
