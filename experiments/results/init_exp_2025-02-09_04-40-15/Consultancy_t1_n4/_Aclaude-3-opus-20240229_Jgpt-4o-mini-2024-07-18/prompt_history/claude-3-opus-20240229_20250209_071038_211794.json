How many men are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 420.0\nThe percentage for women is 100% - 70% = 30%.\nSince 180 represents 30%, then 180/30 = 6 students represent 1%.\nHence, 6 x 70 = 420 students are men.\n#### 420\n(B): 126\nSince 70% of students are men, we can find the number by taking 70% of 180:\n180 \u00d7 0.7 = 126 men in the department.\n#### 126\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 126\nSince 70% of students are men, we can find the number by taking 70% of 180:\n180 \u00d7 0.7 = 126 men in the department.\n#### 126"

The key information is:\n- 70% of students are men\n- There are 180 women\n\nTo calculate the number of men, we need to know the total number of students. Since we know the percentage of men (70%) and the number of women (180), we can calculate the total number of students first. \n\nThe percentage of women must be 100% - 70% = 30%. If 180 women represent 30% of the total, we can calculate the total number of students by dividing 180 by 30% (or 0.3). Once we have the total, we can then take 70% of that to get the number of men.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful in performing these calculations. We have the necessary information to proceed with the tool call.\n</thinking>",
