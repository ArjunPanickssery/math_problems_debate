The regular price of $5 is reduced by the $0.50 discount, making the discounted price $4.50 per book. \n2. Multiplying the $4.50 discounted price by the 10 books purchased results in a total of $45.00 paid.\n\nThe math clearly shows that answer choice (A) of $45.00 is correct based on the given information.",
