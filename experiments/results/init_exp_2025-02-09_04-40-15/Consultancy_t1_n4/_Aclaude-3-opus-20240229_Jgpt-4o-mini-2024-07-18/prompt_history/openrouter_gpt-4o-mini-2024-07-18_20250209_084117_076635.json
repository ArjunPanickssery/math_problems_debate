The required parameters are:\nexpr: the mathematical expression to evaluate\nWe have all the information needed to construct the expressions.\n</thinking><tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"14 * 3\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"14 * 3\"},\n    \"result\": 42,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe key pieces of information needed to solve this problem are:\n- There are 14 apples per box\n- There are 3 boxes total\n- Henry and his brother each eat 1 apple per day\n- We need to calculate how many weeks the apples will last them\n\nTo calculate the total number of apples, we can multiply 14 apples/box by 3 boxes. \nThen to determine how many weeks this will last, we need to divide the total apples by the number of apples eaten per week.\nSince Henry and his brother each eat 1 apple per day, together they eat 2 apples per day, or 14 apples per week.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations.

Since Henry and his brother together eat 14 apples per week (2 per day), the 42 apples will last them 6 weeks. \n\nThe key is that the question asks how many weeks the apples will last in total, not per person. So we divide the total apples by the weekly consumption rate for both Henry and his brother combined. This gives the correct answer of 6 weeks.\n"
