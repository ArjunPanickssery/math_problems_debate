How many more pairs of shoes does Anthony have compared to Jim?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2.0\nAnthony:7(3)=21\nJim:21-2=19\nAnthony has 21-19=2 more pairs of shoes.\n#### 2\n(B): 6.0\nAnthony:7(3)=21\nJim:5(3)=15\nAnthony has 21-15=6 more pairs of shoes.\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe question provides the number of pairs of shoes for Scott, and the relationships between Anthony's and Jim's shoe counts relative to Scott's. The math_eval tool could be used to calculate the number of pairs of shoes Anthony and Jim each have based on the given information. Once those values are determined, the tool could be used again to find the difference between Anthony and Jim's shoe counts to answer how many more pairs Anthony has compared to Jim.\n</thinking><tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"7 * 3\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"7 * 3\"},\n    \"result\": 21,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe question provides the number of pairs of shoes for Scott, and the relationships between Anthony's and Jim's shoe counts relative to Scott's.
