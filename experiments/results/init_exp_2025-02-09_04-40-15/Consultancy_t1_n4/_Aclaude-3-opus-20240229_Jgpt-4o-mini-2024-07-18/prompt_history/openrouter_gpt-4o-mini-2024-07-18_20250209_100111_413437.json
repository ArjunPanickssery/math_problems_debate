      "content": "QUESTION: A farmer gets 20 pounds of bacon on average from a pig. He sells each pound for $6 at the monthly farmer\u2019s market. This month\u2019s pig is a runt that grew to only half the size of the average pig. How many dollars will the farmer make from the pig\u2019s bacon?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nThe pig grew to half the size of the average pig, so it will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nThe rancher will make 10 * 6 = $60 from the pig\u2019s bacon.\n#### 60\n(A): 30.0\nThe pig will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nEach pound will sell for 6 / 2 = $3.\nThe farmer will make 10 * 3 = $30 from the pig's bacon.\n#### 30\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe key pieces of information needed to answer this question are:\n1. The average amount of bacon from a pig (20 pounds)\n2. The selling price per pound of bacon ($6) \n3. This pig is half the size of an average pig\n\nWith these details, we can calculate the expected amount of bacon from this smaller pig, and multiply that by the price per pound to get the total revenue.\n\nNo additional tools are needed, as the question provides all the necessary information and only requires basic arithmetic to solve.\n</thinking>\n\nThe farmer will make $60 from selling the bacon of this half-sized pig. Here's why:\n\nA typical pig yields 20 pounds of bacon on average. Since this month's pig only grew to half the normal size, it will produce half as much bacon as usual. We can calculate this as:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"20 / 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"20 / 2\"},\n    \"result\": 10.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe key pieces of information needed to answer this question are:\n1.

To calculate his total revenue, we simply multiply the 10 pounds of bacon by the $6 per pound price:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"10 * 6\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"10 * 6\"},\n    \"result\": 60,\n}\n</tool_result>\nSo the runt pig will yield 10 pounds of bacon. \n\nThe problem states the farmer sells each pound of bacon for $6.

The selling price per pound remains $6 regardless of the pig's size. Answer (A) incorrectly assumes the price per pound is also halved, but the question does not state this.\n"
