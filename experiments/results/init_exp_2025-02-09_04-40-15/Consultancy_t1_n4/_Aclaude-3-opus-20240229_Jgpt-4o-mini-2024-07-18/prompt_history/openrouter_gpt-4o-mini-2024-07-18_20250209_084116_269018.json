      "content": "QUESTION: Bush and Matt are brothers. Bush is younger than Matt by 3 years. This year Bush will be 12 years old. What will be Matt's age 10 years from now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 25.0\nBush is younger than Matt by 3 years, so if Bush is 12 years old then Matt is 12+3 = 15 years old\nIn 10 years' time, Matt will be 10+15 = 25 years old\n#### 25\n(B): 28.0\nBush is 12, Matt is 3 years older, so Matt is 12+3 = 15\nSince Matt will always be 3 years older, we add 3 again: 15+3 = 18\nIn 10 years' time, Matt will be 18+10 = 28\n#### 28\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe question provides the following information:\n- Bush is younger than Matt by 3 years\n- This year Bush will be 12 years old\n- We need to calculate Matt's age 10 years from now\n\nTo calculate Matt's age in 10 years, we first need to determine his current age based on the age difference with Bush. Since no additional tools are needed, we can directly calculate the answer.\n</thinking>\n\nSince Bush is 3 years younger than Matt, and Bush is currently 12 years old, we can calculate Matt's current age:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12 + 3\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12 + 3\"},\n    \"result\": 15,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe question provides the following information:\n- Bush is younger than Matt by 3 years\n- This year Bush will be 12 years old\n- We need to calculate Matt's age 10 years from now\n\nTo calculate Matt's age in 10 years, we first need to determine his current age based on the age difference with Bush. Since no additional tools are needed, we can directly calculate the answer.\n</thinking>\n\nSince Bush is 3 years younger than Matt, and Bush is currently 12 years old, we can calculate Matt's current age:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12 + 3\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12 + 3\"},\n    \"result\": 15,\n}\n</tool_result>\nSo Matt is currently 15 years old. To determine his age 10 years from now, we simply add 10 to his current age:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"15 + 10\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"15 + 10\"},\n    \"result\": 25,\n}\n</tool_result>\nSo Matt is currently 15 years old.
