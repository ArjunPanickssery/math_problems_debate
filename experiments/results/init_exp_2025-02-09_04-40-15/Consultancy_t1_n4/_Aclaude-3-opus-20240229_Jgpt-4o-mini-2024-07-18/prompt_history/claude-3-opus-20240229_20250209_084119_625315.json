If the Biology class has half as many students as the Physics class, how many boys are in the Biology class?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 25.0\nThe Biology class has 200/2=100 students.\nThe boys in the Biology class are 1/4*100=25 students.\n#### 25\n(B): 33.33\nThe Biology class has 200/2=100 students.\nSince there are three times as many girls, divide total by 3 to get boys: 100/3\u224833.33\n#### 33.33\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 33.33\nThe Biology class has 200/2=100 students.\nSince there are three times as many girls, divide total by 3 to get boys: 100/3\u224833.33\n#### 33.33"

This can be done by dividing the number of students in the Physics class by 2.\n\nOnce we have the total number of students in the Biology class, we can calculate the number of boys. Since there are three times as many girls as boys, the boys make up 1/4 of the total class. So dividing the total number of Biology students by 4 would give the number of boys.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1. Calculate total Biology students as Physics students / 2\n2. Calculate boys as total Biology students / 4\n\nNo additional information or tool usage seems necessary. The problem can be solved with the given information and basic math operations.\n</thinking>",
