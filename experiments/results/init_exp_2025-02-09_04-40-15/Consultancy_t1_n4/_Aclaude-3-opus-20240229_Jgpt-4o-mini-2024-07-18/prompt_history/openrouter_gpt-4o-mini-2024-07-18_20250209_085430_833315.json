How many cows are not black?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 4.0\nHalf of the cows: 18/2=9\nBlack cows: 5+9=14\n18-14=4 cows\n#### 4\n(B): 6\nTotal cows plus 5: 18+5 = 23\nHalf of 23 (rounded): 12\nThese are black cows\nNon-black cows: 18-12 = 6\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe question provides the total number of cows (18) and a relationship between the number of black cows and half the total cows (5 more than half are black). To determine the number of non-black cows, we need to calculate the number of black cows and subtract that from the total.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be useful for performing the calculations needed to solve this problem. The key steps are:\n1. Calculate half the total number of cows\n2. Add 5 to that result to get the number of black cows \n3. Subtract the number of black cows from the total to get the number of non-black cows\n\nThe math_eval tool has the required parameters to perform each of these steps. No additional information is needed from the user.\n</thinking><tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"18/2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"18/2\"},\n    \"result\": 9.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe question provides the total number of cows (18) and a relationship between the number of black cows and half the total cows (5 more than half are black).

The correct answer is (A) 4 non-black cows.\n"
