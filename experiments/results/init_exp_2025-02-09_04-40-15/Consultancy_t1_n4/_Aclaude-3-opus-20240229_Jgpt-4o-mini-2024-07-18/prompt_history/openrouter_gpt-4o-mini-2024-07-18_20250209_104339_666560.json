How many birds eggs did she find?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 17.0\nThere are 2 nests with 5 eggs each so 2*5 = 10 eggs\nWhen you add up all the eggs she has found she has 10+3+4 = 17 eggs\n#### 17\n(A): 14.0\nFor the first tree with 2 nests: 2+5 = 7 eggs\nThe second tree has 3 eggs\nThe front yard nest has 4 eggs\nTotal eggs found: 7+3+4 = 14\n#### 14\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe question provides the following information:\n- 2 bird nests in 1 tree with 5 eggs each\n- 1 nest in another tree with 3 eggs \n- 1 nest in the front yard with 4 eggs\nTo calculate the total number of eggs, we need to:\n1. Find the total eggs in the first tree by multiplying the number of nests by eggs per nest\n2. Add the eggs from the nest in the second tree\n3. Add the eggs from the nest in the front yard\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations.

The calculation in answer choice (A) incorrectly adds the number of nests to the eggs per nest for the first tree, rather than multiplying them.\n"
