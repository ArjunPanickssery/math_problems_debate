This can be done by adding 5 to the number of red crayons.\n\nThen, we need to double the number of blue crayons and subtract 6 to get the number of yellow crayons.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The required parameters are:\n- Number of red crayons: 14 (provided)\n- Number of blue crayons: 14 + 5 = 19 (can be calculated)\n- Number of yellow crayons: 2 * 19 - 6 = 32 (can be calculated)\n\nSo the math_eval tool has all the necessary information to calculate the final answer.\n</thinking>",
