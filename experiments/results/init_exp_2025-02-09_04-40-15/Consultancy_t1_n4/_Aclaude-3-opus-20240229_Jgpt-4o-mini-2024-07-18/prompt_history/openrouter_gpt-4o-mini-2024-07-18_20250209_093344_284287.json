If she has $51 left, how much money, in dollars, did she have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 204.0\nAfter buying the toy, Isabel has 51*2=102 dollars left.\nIsabel had 102*2=204 dollars at first.\n#### 204\n(A): 408.0\nWorking backwards from what's left:\n51 * 2 = 102 is the previous amount\n102 * 2 = 204 is the amount before that\n204 * 2 = 408 was the initial amount\n#### 408\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe key information provided is:\n- Isabel spent half her money on a toy\n- She then spent half of the remaining money on a book for her brother \n- She has $51 left\nTo determine how much she started with, we need to work backwards from the $51 she has left, doubling the amount at each step since she spent half the money each time.\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful to perform the doubling calculations at each step to arrive at the initial amount.\n</thinking><tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"51 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"51 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 102,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe key information provided is:\n- Isabel spent half her money on a toy\n- She then spent half of the remaining money on a book for her brother \n- She has $51 left\nTo determine how much she started with, we need to work backwards from the $51 she has left, doubling the amount at each step since she spent half the money each time.\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful to perform the doubling calculations at each step to arrive at the initial amount.\n</thinking><tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"51 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"51 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 102,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe $102 represents the amount Isabel had after buying the toy, before buying the book.

The math confirms the answer I am arguing for is correct.\n"
