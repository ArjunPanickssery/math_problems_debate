This will make the reasoning clear and easy to follow.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1. Calculate the total price of the 2 pairs of pants \n2. Calculate the total price of the 4 shirts\n3. Add the prices of the pants and shirts to get the total purchase price\n4. Subtract the total purchase price from the $250 Laura gave the cashier to determine the change\n\nNo additional information is needed from the user, as the problem statement provides the number of items purchased, the price per item, and the amount of money given to the cashier. All the required parameters for the math_eval tool can be directly populated.\n</thinking>\n\nTo calculate the change Laura received, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total price of the 2 pairs of pants that Laura bought at $54 each:",
