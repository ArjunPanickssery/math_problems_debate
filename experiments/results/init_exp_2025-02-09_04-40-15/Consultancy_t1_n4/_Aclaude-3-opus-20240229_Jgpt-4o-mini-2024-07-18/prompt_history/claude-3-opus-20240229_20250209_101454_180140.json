      "content": "QUESTION: Maci is planning for the new school year and goes to the store to buy pens. She needs ten blue pens and 15 red pens. If a blue pen costs ten cents each and a red pen costs twice as much as the blue pen, how much money does Maci pay for the pens?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nMaci pays 10 * $0.10 = $1 for the blue pens.\nEach red pen costs 2*$0.10 = $0.20\nShe pays 15*$0.20 = $3.00 for the red pens.\nTo buy all the pens she needs, Maci pays $3+$1= $4\n#### 4\n(A): 3.0\nMaci pays 10 * $0.10 = $1.00 for the blue pens.\nThe red pens should cost twice as much, so that's $1.00 * 2 = $2.00\nTo buy all the pens she needs, Maci pays $2.00 + $1.00 = $3.00\n#### 3\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 4.0\nMaci pays 10 * $0.10 = $1 for the blue pens.\nEach red pen costs 2*$0.10 = $0.20\nShe pays 15*$0.20 = $3.00 for the red pens.\nTo buy all the pens she needs, Maci pays $3+$1= $4\n#### 4"
