      "content": "QUESTION: A lorry is 500 pounds when empty. What will its weight be if it's loaded with 20 bags of apples, each weighing 60 pounds?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 1700.0\nIf the lorry is loaded with 20 bags of apples, each weighing 60 pounds, it will have an additional weight of 20*60=1200\nThe total weight of the lorry after being loaded with the bags of apples will be 500+1200=1700 pounds\n#### 1700\n(B): 11200.0\nTo find the total weight, we must account for weight distribution across all bags, so multiply the empty weight by the number of bags:\n500 * 20 = 10000\nThen add the total weight of the apples:\n20 * 60 = 1200\nThe final weight is therefore 10000 + 1200 = 11200 pounds\n#### 11200\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe question is asking for the total weight of the lorry after loading it with 20 bags of apples, each weighing 60 pounds. To calculate this, we need to:\n1. Find the total weight of the apples by multiplying the number of bags by the weight per bag\n2. Add the weight of the apples to the empty weight of the lorry\nThe math_eval tool can be used to perform both of these calculations. No other tools are needed.\n</thinking><tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"20 * 60\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"20 * 60\"},\n    \"result\": 1200,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe question is asking for the total weight of the lorry after loading it with 20 bags of apples, each weighing 60 pounds.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1700 pounds.\n"
