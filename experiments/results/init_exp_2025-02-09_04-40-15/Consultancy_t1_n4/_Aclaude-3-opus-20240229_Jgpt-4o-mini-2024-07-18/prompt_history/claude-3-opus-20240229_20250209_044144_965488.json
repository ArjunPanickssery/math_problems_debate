          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key steps to solve this problem are:\n1. Calculate the total number of apples in the 3 boxes. This can be done by multiplying the number of apples per box (14) by the number of boxes (3).\n2. Determine how many apples each person (Henry and his brother) gets. This is the total apples divided by 2, since the apples are split between the two of them.\n3. Figure out how many weeks it will take them to eat their apples at a rate of 1 apple per day each. This is the number of apples per person divided by 7, since there are 7 days in a week.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful for doing these calculations. The total apples calculation (step 1) and the apples per person calculation (step 2) could each be done with a single math_eval call. The final weeks calculation (step 3) would require the output from step 2 first.\n</thinking>",
