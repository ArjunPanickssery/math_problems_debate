      "content": "QUESTION: Asia bought a homecoming dress on sale for $140. It was originally priced at $350. What percentage off did she get at the sale?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nAsia saved $350 - $140 = $210 on the dress.\nThat means she saved $210 / $350 = 0.60 or 60% off on the dress.\n#### 60\n(A): 150\nFind the difference: $350 - $140 = $210\nCalculate the percentage off: $210/$140 = 1.5 or 150%\n#### 150\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe question is asking what percentage off Asia got on the dress. To calculate a percentage off, you need the original price and the sale price.\n\nThe relevant information provided is:\nOriginal price: $350\nSale price: $140\n\nTo calculate the percentage off, you first find the dollar amount saved, which is the original price minus the sale price. Then you divide the amount saved by the original price.\n\nNo additional tools are needed, as the original price and sale price are directly provided. The formula for percentage off can be calculated without any tools.\n</thinking>\n\nTo calculate the percentage off, first find the dollar amount Asia saved:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"350 - 140\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"350 - 140\"},\n    \"result\": 210,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe question is asking what percentage off Asia got on the dress.

Therefore, the percentage off Asia got on the dress was 60%, not 150%. The calculation of $210/$140 = 1.5 or 150% is incorrect, as it divides the amount saved by the sale price rather than the original price. To calculate the percentage off, you must divide the amount saved by the original price, not the sale price.\n"
