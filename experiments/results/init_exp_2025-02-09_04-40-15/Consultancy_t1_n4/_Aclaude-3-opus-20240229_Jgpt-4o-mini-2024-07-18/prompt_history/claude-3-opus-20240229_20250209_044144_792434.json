How many necklaces Jason has, given that Haley has 5 more than him and she has 25 total. This can be done with simple subtraction.\n2. How many necklaces Josh has, given that he has half as many as Jason. This requires dividing Jason's total by 2.\n3. The difference between Haley's necklaces (25) and Josh's amount from step 2.\n\nNo tools are needed since the math is straightforward. We have all the necessary information to solve the problem.\n</thinking>\n\nHaley has 25 necklaces, and we're told she has 5 more than Jason. To find how many Jason has, we can subtract 5 from Haley's total:",
