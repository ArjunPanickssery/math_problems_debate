After 4 years, how many baby plants will the mother plant have produced?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 16.0\nThe mother plant produces 2 baby plants 2 times a year so it produces 2*2 = 4 plants a year\nIt produces 4 plants a year so after 4 years it will produce 4*4 = 16 baby plants\n#### 16\n(B): 30.0\nThe mother plant produces 2 babies twice per year\nIn the first year we get 2 babies from the first time\nThen we add 2 more from the second time that year\nIn the second year we get 4 more total\nIn the third year we get 8 more total\nIn the fourth year we get 16 more total\nAdding all babies: 2 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30 baby plants\n#### 30\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 16.0\nThe mother plant produces 2 baby plants 2 times a year so it produces 2*2 = 4 plants a year\nIt produces 4 plants a year so after 4 years it will produce 4*4 = 16 baby plants\n#### 16"

Figure out how many baby plants are produced each year\n2. Multiply that by the number of years to get the total\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform the calculations needed. The parameters would be:\n- To calculate baby plants per year: expr=\"2 * 2\" \n- To calculate total baby plants: expr=\"4 * 4\"\n\nNo additional information is needed from the user, as the problem statement provides the number of baby plants per cycle, cycles per year, and number of years to calculate the total over.\n</thinking>",
