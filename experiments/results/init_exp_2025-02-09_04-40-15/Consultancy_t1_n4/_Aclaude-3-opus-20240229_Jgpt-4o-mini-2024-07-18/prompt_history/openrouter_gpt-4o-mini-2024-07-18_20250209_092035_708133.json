      "content": "QUESTION: There are 14 red crayons, 5 more blue crayons than red crayons, and 6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons.  How many yellow crayons are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 32.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:5+14=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)-6=32 crayons\n#### 32\n(A): 44.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:14+5=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)+6=44 crayons\n#### 44\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nTo determine the number of yellow crayons, we first need to calculate the number of blue crayons based on the number of red crayons. Then we can use the number of blue crayons to calculate the number of yellow crayons.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The required parameters are:\n- Number of red crayons (given as 14)\n- Expression to calculate blue crayons from red (red + 5) \n- Expression to calculate yellow crayons from blue (blue * 2 - 6)\n\nWe have all the necessary information to make the tool calls without needing any additional input from the user.\n</thinking><tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"14 + 5\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"14 + 5\"},\n    \"result\": 19,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nTo determine the number of yellow crayons, we first need to calculate the number of blue crayons based on the number of red crayons.

Doubling 19 is 38, and 38 - 6 = 32. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 32 yellow crayons. The calculations clearly show there are 14 red, 19 blue (5 more than red), and 32 yellow (6 less than double the blue).\n"
