      "content": "QUESTION: Oli's banana split has 4 scoops of ice cream while Victoria has twice more scoops of ice cream than Oli's. How many more scoops of ice cream does Victoria have than Oli?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nVictoria has 4 x 2 = 8 scoops of ice cream.\nTherefore, Victoria has 8 - 4 = 4 more scoops of ice cream than Oli.\n#### 4\n(A): 8.0\nVictoria's scoops can be calculated as 4 + (2 \u00d7 4) = 4 + 8 = 12 scoops of ice cream.\nTherefore, Victoria has 12 - 4 = 8 more scoops than Oli.\n#### 8\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe question asks how many more scoops of ice cream Victoria has compared to Oli. We are given that:\n- Oli has 4 scoops of ice cream \n- Victoria has twice as many scoops as Oli\nTo determine how many more scoops Victoria has, we need to:\n1. Calculate the number of scoops Victoria has\n2. Subtract Oli's number of scoops from Victoria's\nThe math_eval tool could be useful for performing these calculations.
