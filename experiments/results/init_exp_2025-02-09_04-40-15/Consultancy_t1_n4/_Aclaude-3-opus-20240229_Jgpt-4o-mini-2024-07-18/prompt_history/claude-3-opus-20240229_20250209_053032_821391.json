If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100\n(B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25"

The ratio 2:1:3 means that for every 1 part Amy gets, Sandra gets 2 parts and Ruth gets 3 parts.\nSince I'm told the dollar amount Amy received ($50), I should be able to calculate Sandra's amount from that using the ratio. It looks like I may need to divide Amy's amount by her ratio part to determine the value of 1 part, then multiply that by Sandra's ratio part.\n</thinking>\n\nTo determine how much Sandra got, let's first calculate the value of 1 part in the ratio:",
