      "content": "QUESTION: In the matrix, there are seven fewer noodles than pirates. If there are 45 pirates, how many noodles and pirates are there in total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 83.0\nIn the matrix, there are seven fewer noodles than pirates, meaning there are 45-7=38 noodles.\nThe number of noodles and pirates in the matrix is 38+45=83\n#### 83\n(A): 97.0\nIn the matrix, there are seven fewer noodles than pirates, meaning there are 45+7=52 noodles.\nThe number of noodles and pirates in the matrix is 52+45=97\n#### 97\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe question provides the key information that there are 45 pirates in the matrix, and 7 fewer noodles than pirates. To determine the total number of noodles and pirates, I need to:\n\n1. Calculate the number of noodles by subtracting 7 from the number of pirates\n2. Add the number of noodles and pirates together\n\nNo tools are needed since the question can be answered with basic arithmetic.\n</thinking>\n\nThe question states that in the matrix, there are 7 fewer noodles than pirates, and that there are 45 pirates. To find the number of noodles, we take the number of pirates (45) and subtract 7, since there are 7 fewer noodles. This gives us:\n\n45 pirates - 7 = 38 noodles\n\nSo there are 38 noodles in the matrix. \n\nTo find the total number of noodles and pirates, we simply add the number of noodles (38) and the number of pirates (45):\n\n38 noodles + 45 pirates = 83 total\n\nTherefore, the total number of noodles and pirates in the matrix is 83, so answer choice (B) is correct.\n"
