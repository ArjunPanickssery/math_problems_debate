If it takes Lexie 20 minutes to run a mile, how long, in minutes, will it take Celia to 30 miles?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 300.0\nIf Lexie takes 20 minutes to run a mile, Celia takes 20/2 = 10 minutes to run the same distance since she is twice as fast.\nCelia takes 10 minutes to run one mile so it will take 10*30 = 300 minutes to run 30 miles.\n#### 300\n(A): 1200.0\nFor one mile, since Celia runs twice as fast as Lexie, she will take 20 * 2 = 40 minutes.\nTo run 30 miles, she will need 40 * 30 = 1200 minutes.\n#### 1200\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe key information provided is:\n- Celia runs twice as fast as Lexie\n- It takes Lexie 20 minutes to run a mile\n- We need to calculate how long it will take Celia to run 30 miles\n\nTo calculate the time for Celia, we first need to determine how long it takes her to run a single mile based on her speed relative to Lexie's. Once we have Celia's time per mile, we can multiply that by the total distance of 30 miles to get the final answer.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful in performing the calculations once we have determined the relevant equations.
