Determine how many books Katie has based on Darla's book count\n2. Add Darla and Katie's books together\n3. Multiply that sum by 5 to get Gary's book count \n4. Add Darla, Katie and Gary's books together for the total\n\nNo tools are needed since the question can be answered with the given information and basic math operations.\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the problem, Katie has half as many books as Darla. Since Darla has 6 books, that means Katie must have 12 books, which is double Darla's amount. \n\nAdding Darla's 6 books and Katie's 12 books together gives us a total of 18 books between the two of them.\n\nWe're also told that Gary has 5 times the combined number of books that Darla and Katie have. So to calculate Gary's total, we take the 18 books Darla and Katie have together and multiply that by 5, which equals 90 books for Gary.\n\nFinally, to get the total number of books all three have, we sum up each individual's book count:\n- Darla: 6 books  \n- Katie: 12 books\n- Gary: 90 books\n6 + 12 + 90 = 108 total books\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Darla, Katie and Gary have a total of 108 books combined.",
