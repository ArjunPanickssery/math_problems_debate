      "content": "QUESTION: Sam shared a sum of money between his three cousins Sandra, Amy and Ruth in the ratio 2:1:3 respectively. If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100\n(B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe question provides a ratio of how money was split between Sam's three cousins. To determine how much Sandra got, we need to use the ratio and the amount Amy received. The math_eval tool could be used to calculate Sandra's amount by multiplying Amy's $50 by the ratio between Sandra and Amy's shares.\n</thinking><tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"50 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"50 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 100,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe question provides a ratio of how money was split between Sam's three cousins.

This means that for every 1 part Amy received, Sandra received 2 parts. \n\nWe are told Amy received $50. Using the ratio, to calculate Sandra's amount, we multiply Amy's $50 by the ratio between Sandra and Amy's shares, which is 2.\n\nUsing the math_eval tool, 50 * 2 equals 100.\n\nTherefore, since Amy got $50, going by the 2:1 ratio between Sandra and Amy, Sandra received $100.\n"
