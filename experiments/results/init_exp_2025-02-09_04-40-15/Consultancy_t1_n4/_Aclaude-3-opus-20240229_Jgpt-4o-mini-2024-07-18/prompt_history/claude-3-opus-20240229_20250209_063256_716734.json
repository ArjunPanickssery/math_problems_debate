To calculate the total number of books, we need to:\n1. Calculate the number of books Katie has based on the relationship to Darla's books\n2. Calculate the number of books Gary has based on the relationship to the combined number of books Darla and Katie have\n3. Sum the number of books each person has to get the total\nNo additional tools are needed, as the question provides all the necessary information and only requires performing the stated calculations.\n</thinking>\n\nThe given answer (A) is correct. Here is the reasoning:\n\nWe are told that Darla has 6 books. The question also states that Katie has half as many books as Darla. Since half of 6 is 3, that means Katie has 3 books.",
