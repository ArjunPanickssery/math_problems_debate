If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 72.0\nMelissa spends 2x3=6 hours driving each month.\nSince there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=72 hours driving each year.\n#### 72\n(A): 144.0\nEach round trip consists of a 3-hour drive to town and a 3-hour drive back, totaling 6 hours per trip.\nSince Melissa makes two trips per month, she drives 6x2=12 hours monthly.\nIn a year, she spends 12x12=144 hours driving.\n#### 144\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 72.0\nMelissa spends 2x3=6 hours driving each month.\nSince there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=72 hours driving each year.\n#### 72"
