      "content": "QUESTION: Twenty years ago, Shane was 2 times older than Garret is now. If Garret is currently 12, how old is Shane now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 44.0\nTwenty years ago, Shane was 12 * 2 = 24 years old\nShane is currently 24 + 20 = 44 years old\n#### 44\n(A): 64.0\nFirst, we know Shane was 2 times Garret's current age of 12\nSo Shane was 12 * 2 = 24\nThen we need to account for the twenty year difference twice\nAdding 20 years for Shane and 20 years for the time difference\nSo Shane is currently 24 + 40 = 64 years old\n#### 64\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe question asks how old Shane is now, given that 20 years ago he was twice as old as Garret is currently at age 12. To determine Shane's current age, we need to:\n1. Calculate how old Shane was 20 years ago by doubling Garret's current age\n2. Add 20 years to Shane's age from 20 years ago to get his current age\nNo tools are needed, as the necessary information is provided in the question and the calculations are straightforward.\n</thinking>\n\nThe key facts are:\n- 20 years ago, Shane was 2 times older than Garret is now\n- Garret is currently 12 years old\n\nTo calculate Shane's age 20 years ago:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 24,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe question asks how old Shane is now, given that 20 years ago he was twice as old as Garret is currently at age 12.

The other answer incorrectly adds the 20 year time difference twice.\n"
