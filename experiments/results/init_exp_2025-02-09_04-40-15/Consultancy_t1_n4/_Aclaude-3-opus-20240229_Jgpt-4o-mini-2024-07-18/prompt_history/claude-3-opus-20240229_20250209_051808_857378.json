How many bowling balls are there in total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 66.0\nThere are 30 + 6 = 36 green bowling balls\nIn total there are 30 + 36 = 66 bowling balls\n#### 66\n(B): 72.0\nThere are 30 red bowling balls\nFor green balls, we add 6 more than red, so 30 + 6 = 36 green balls\nTotal is 30 + 36 + 6 = 72 bowling balls\n#### 72\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 66.0\nThere are 30 + 6 = 36 green bowling balls\nIn total there are 30 + 36 = 66 bowling balls\n#### 66"
