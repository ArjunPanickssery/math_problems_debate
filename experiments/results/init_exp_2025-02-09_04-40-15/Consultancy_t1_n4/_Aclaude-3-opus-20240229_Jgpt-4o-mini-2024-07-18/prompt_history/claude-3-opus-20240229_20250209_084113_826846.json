We are given that Stu has 9 books, and Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu.\n\nTo calculate Albert's books, the answer I'm arguing for says to take Stu's 9 books and add 4 for each book. This would give:\n9 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 45 books for Albert\n\nHowever, the answer states this equals 13 books for Albert, which is incorrect. \n\nTo get the total, the answer adds Albert's supposed 13 books to Stu's 9 books to get 22 total. \n\nThe math in this answer is flawed. To properly calculate Albert's books, we need to multiply Stu's book count by 4, not add 4 to Stu's count.\n\nI can use the math_eval tool to show the correct calculation for Albert's books:",
