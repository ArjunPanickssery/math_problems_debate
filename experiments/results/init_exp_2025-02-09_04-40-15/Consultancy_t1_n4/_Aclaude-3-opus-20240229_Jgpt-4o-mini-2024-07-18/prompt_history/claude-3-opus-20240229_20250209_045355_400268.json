To calculate this, we need to:\n1. Calculate the number of books Peter has read by multiplying the total number of books by Peter's percentage \n2. Calculate the number of books Peter's brother has read by multiplying the total number of books by the brother's percentage\n3. Subtract the number of books the brother has read from the number Peter has read to get the difference\n\nThe question does not require any additional tools or information.
