This shows that Anthony has 2 more pairs of shoes than Jim.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) - Anthony has 2 more pairs of shoes than Jim.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total number of pairs of shoes Scott has? \n\nHow many pairs of shoes does Anthony have in relation to Scott? \n\nWhat is the formula used to determine how many pairs of shoes Jim has? \n\nHow do you calculate the difference in the number of pairs of shoes between Anthony and Jim? \n\nCan you confirm the calculations for Anthony's and Jim's pairs of shoes? \n\nWhat is the final answer after performing all calculations?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 2.0\nAnthony:7(3)=21\nJim:21-2=19\nAnthony has 21-19=2 more pairs of shoes.\n#### 2"
