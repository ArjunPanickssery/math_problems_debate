How tall is he in feet?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 6.0\nHe gained 2*3=6 inches\nSo his height is 66+6=72 inches\nSo he is 72/12=6 feet tall\n#### 6\n(B): 17.0\nFirst find total change in height:\n(66+2)*3 = 68*3 = 204 inches\nConvert to feet: 204/12 = 17 feet\n#### 17.0\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 17.0\nFirst find total change in height:\n(66+2)*3 = 68*3 = 204 inches\nConvert to feet: 204/12 = 17 feet\n#### 17.0"

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question is asking for John's height in feet after he grew 2 inches per month for 3 months, starting from a height of 66 inches. To calculate this, we need to:\n1. Find the total change in height by multiplying the growth per month by the number of months\n2. Add the total change in height to John's original height to get his final height in inches\n3. Convert the final height from inches to feet by dividing by 12\n\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful for steps 1 and 2 to calculate the total change in height and add it to the original height. For step 3, we can do the unit conversion from inches to feet ourselves without needing a tool.\n\nSo the plan is:\n1. Use math_eval to calculate total change in height: 2 * 3\n2. Use math_eval again to add change in height to original height: 66 + (result from step 1) \n3. Manually convert final height in inches to feet by dividing by 12\n</thinking>",
