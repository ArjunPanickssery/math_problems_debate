      "content": "QUESTION: Tim has some cans of soda. Jeff comes by, and takes 6 cans of soda from Tim. Tim then goes and buys another half the amount of soda cans he had left. If Tim has 24 cans of soda in the end, how many cans of soda did Tim have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 22.0\nLet x be the number of cans Tim has at first.\nAfter Jeff comes by, Tim has x-6 cans left.\nTim buys another (x-6)/2 cans.\nx-6+(x-6)/2=24\n2*x-12+x-6=48\n3*x-18=48\n3*x=66\nx=22\n#### 22\n(A): 20.0\nx - 6 + x/2 = 24\n2x - 12 + x = 48\n3x = 60\nx = 20\n#### 20\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe key steps to solve this problem are:\n1. Define a variable for the initial number of soda cans Tim had\n2. Subtract the number of cans Jeff took \n3. Add half of the remaining cans after Jeff took some\n4. Set up an equation to solve for the initial number of cans\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful in solving the equation once it is set up.

Let x be the number of soda cans Tim had initially. Jeff took 6 cans, leaving Tim with x-6 cans. Tim then bought half of the remaining amount, which is (x-6)/2. \n\nAdding the cans Tim had after Jeff took some and the additional cans he bought gives the final amount of 24:\nx - 6 + (x-6)/2 = 24\n\nSolving this equation:\n2(x-6) + x - 6 = 48\n2x - 12 + x - 6 = 48\n3x - 18 = 48\n3x = 66\nx = 22\n\nTherefore, Tim initially had 22 cans of soda, which matches the answer in (B).\n"
