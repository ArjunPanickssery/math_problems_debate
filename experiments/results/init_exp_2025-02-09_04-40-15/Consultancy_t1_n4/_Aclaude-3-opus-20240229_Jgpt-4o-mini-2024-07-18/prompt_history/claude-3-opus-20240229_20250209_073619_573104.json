      "content": "QUESTION: A lorry is 500 pounds when empty. What will its weight be if it's loaded with 20 bags of apples, each weighing 60 pounds?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 1700.0\nIf the lorry is loaded with 20 bags of apples, each weighing 60 pounds, it will have an additional weight of 20*60=1200\nThe total weight of the lorry after being loaded with the bags of apples will be 500+1200=1700 pounds\n#### 1700\n(B): 11200.0\nTo find the total weight, we must account for weight distribution across all bags, so multiply the empty weight by the number of bags:\n500 * 20 = 10000\nThen add the total weight of the apples:\n20 * 60 = 1200\nThe final weight is therefore 10000 + 1200 = 11200 pounds\n#### 11200\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 1700.0\nIf the lorry is loaded with 20 bags of apples, each weighing 60 pounds, it will have an additional weight of 20*60=1200\nThe total weight of the lorry after being loaded with the bags of apples will be 500+1200=1700 pounds\n#### 1700"
