To determine how many more pairs of shoes Anthony has compared to Jim, we need to calculate the number of pairs each person has.\n\nThe key information is:\n- Scott has 7 pairs of shoes\n- Anthony has 3 times as many pairs as Scott\n- Jim has 2 less pairs than Anthony\n\nTo calculate Anthony's pairs, we can use the math_eval tool with the expression \"7 * 3\". \nTo calculate Jim's pairs, we first need Anthony's total, then subtract 2. This can be done by nesting two math_eval calls.\n\nNo additional information is needed from the user. We have all the necessary values to make the tool calls and answer the question.\n</thinking>",
