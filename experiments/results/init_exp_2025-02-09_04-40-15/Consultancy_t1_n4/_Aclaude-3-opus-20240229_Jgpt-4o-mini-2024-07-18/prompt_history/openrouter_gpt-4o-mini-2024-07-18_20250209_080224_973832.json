      "content": "QUESTION: Mr. Curtis has 325 chickens on his farm where 28 are roosters and the rest are hens. Twenty hens do not lay eggs while the rest of the hens do. How many egg-laying hens does Mr. Curtis have on his farm?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 277.0\nMr. Curtis has 325 - 28 = 297 hens.\nOut of the 297 hens, only 297 - 20 = 277 hens lay eggs.\n#### 277\n(A): 297.0\nTotal chickens on farm = 325\nNumber of hens = 325 - 28 = 297\nTotal hens including non-laying ones = 297 + 20 = 317\nNumber of laying hens = 317 - 20 = 297\n#### 297\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nTo determine how many egg-laying hens Mr. Curtis has, we need to:\n1. Calculate the total number of hens by subtracting the number of roosters from the total number of chickens. This can be done with the math_eval tool.\n2. Calculate the number of egg-laying hens by subtracting the number of non-laying hens from the total number of hens.

So to get the number of egg-laying hens, we subtract the 20 non-laying hens from the 297 total hens. \n\nThis gives us 277 egg-laying hens on Mr. Curtis' farm, which matches answer choice (B).\n"
