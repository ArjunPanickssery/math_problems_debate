How many birds eggs did she find?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 17.0\nThere are 2 nests with 5 eggs each so 2*5 = 10 eggs\nWhen you add up all the eggs she has found she has 10+3+4 = 17 eggs\n#### 17\n(A): 14.0\nFor the first tree with 2 nests: 2+5 = 7 eggs\nThe second tree has 3 eggs\nThe front yard nest has 4 eggs\nTotal eggs found: 7+3+4 = 14\n#### 14\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe key steps to solve this problem are:\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs in the 2 nests with 5 eggs each in the first tree\n2. Add the number of eggs in the nest in the second tree \n3. Add the number of eggs in the nest in the front yard\n4. Sum up the eggs from all the nests to get the total\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform the calculations in steps 1 and 4.
