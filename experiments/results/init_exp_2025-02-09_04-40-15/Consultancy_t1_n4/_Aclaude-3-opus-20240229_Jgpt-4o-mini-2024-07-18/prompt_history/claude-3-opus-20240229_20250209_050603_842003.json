          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question is asking how much Brianne will save in May if she saves $10 in January and doubles her savings each month. To calculate this, I will need to determine the amount she saves in each month leading up to May by multiplying her previous month's savings by 2.\n\nThe key information is:\n- Brianne saves $10 in January \n- Each month she saves twice as much as the previous month\n- We need to calculate her savings amount in May\n\nTo get to the May amount, I'll need to calculate her savings for February, March and April by repeatedly multiplying by 2. No additional tools are needed, I can perform the simple calculations directly in my response.\n</thinking>\n\nThe amount Brianne saves in May will be $810. Here's how we arrive at that:\n\nIn January, Brianne saves $10. \nIn February, she saves twice as much, which is $10 * 2 = $20.\nMarch savings: $20 * 2 = $40\nApril savings: $40 * 2 = $80 \nAnd finally, in May her savings will be $80 * 2 = $160.\n\nSo following the pattern of doubling her savings each month, Brianne will save $160 in the month of May.",
