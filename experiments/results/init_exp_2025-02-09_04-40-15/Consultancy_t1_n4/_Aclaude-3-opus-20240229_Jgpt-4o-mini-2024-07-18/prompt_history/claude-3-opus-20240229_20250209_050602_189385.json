To solve for the number of apples Kayla picked, we can set up an equation using a variable to represent the unknown number of apples Kylie picked.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to solve the resulting equation for Kylie's number of apples. Once we have that value, we can plug it into the expression for Kayla's apples to calculate the final answer.\n\nNo additional information is needed from the user, as the question provides all the necessary details to set up and solve the equation.\n</thinking>",
