It provides his win percentage for the first 100 games (50%) and the next 100 games (60%) separately.\n\nTo calculate the total wins, we need to:\n1. Calculate the number of wins in the first 100 games using the 50% win rate\n2. Calculate the number of wins in the next 100 games using the 60% win rate \n3. Add the wins from the two sets of 100 games together\n\nNo additional information or tools are needed, as the question provides the necessary win percentages and we can perform the calculations directly.\n</thinking>\n\nTo determine the total number of matches Sam won, let's break it down:\n\nIn the first 100 matches, Sam won 50% of them.",
