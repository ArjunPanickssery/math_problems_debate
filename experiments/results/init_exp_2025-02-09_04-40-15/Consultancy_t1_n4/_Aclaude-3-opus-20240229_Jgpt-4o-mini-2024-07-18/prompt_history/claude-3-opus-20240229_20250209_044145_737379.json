          "content": "<thinking>\nThe given question provides the following information:\n- There are three times as many girls as boys in the Biology class\n- The Physics class has 200 students\n- The Biology class has half as many students as the Physics class\n\nTo determine the number of boys in the Biology class, we first need to calculate the total number of students in the Biology class. This can be done by dividing the number of students in the Physics class by 2.\n\nOnce we have the total number of students in the Biology class, we can calculate the number of boys. Since there are three times as many girls as boys, the boys make up 1/4 of the total class. So dividing the total number of Biology students by 4 would give the number of boys.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1. Calculate total Biology students as Physics students / 2\n2. Calculate boys as total Biology students / 4\n\nNo additional information or tool usage seems necessary. The problem can be solved with the given information and basic math operations.\n</thinking>",
