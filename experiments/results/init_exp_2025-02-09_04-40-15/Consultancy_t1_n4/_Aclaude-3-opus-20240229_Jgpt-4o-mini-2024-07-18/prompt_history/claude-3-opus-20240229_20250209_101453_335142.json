      "content": "QUESTION: A school choir needs robes for each of its 30 singers. Currently, the school has only 12 robes so they decided to buy the rest. If each robe costs $2, how much will the school spend?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 36.0\nThe school needs to buy 30 - 12 = 18 robes.\nSo the school will spend 18 x $2 = $36.\n#### 36\n(B): 60.0\nTo find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for all singers who need robes.\nWith 30 singers and $2 per robe, the total cost would be 30 x $2 = $60.\n#### 60\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe key information needed to answer this question is:\n- The school choir has 30 singers total\n- The school currently has 12 robes\n- Each robe costs $2\nTo calculate the amount the school will spend, we need to:\n1. Figure out how many additional robes are needed (30 total singers - 12 current robes)\n2. Multiply the number of additional robes needed by the cost per robe ($2)\nNo tools are needed, as this can be calculated directly from the given information.\n</thinking>\n\nThe school choir needs a total of 30 robes, one for each singer. They already have 12 robes, so they only need to purchase additional robes for the remaining singers who don't have one.<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"30 - 12\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"30 - 12\"},\n    \"result\": 18,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe key information needed to answer this question is:\n- The school choir has 30 singers total\n- The school currently has 12 robes\n- Each robe costs $2\nTo calculate the amount the school will spend, we need to:\n1.

Since each robe costs $2, we can calculate the total cost:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"18 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"18 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 36,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe calculation shows they need 18 more robes.

Answer A is correct.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total number of singers in the choir?  \nHow many robes does the school currently have?  \nWhat is the cost of each robe?  \nHow many additional robes does the school need to buy?  \nWhat is the total cost calculation based on the additional robes needed?  \nIs there any reason to consider the total number of singers in the cost calculation?  \nCould there be any hidden costs or discounts associated with the robe purchase?  \nAre there any alternative options for obtaining the robes that could affect the total cost?  \n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 36.0\nThe school needs to buy 30 - 12 = 18 robes.\nSo the school will spend 18 x $2 = $36.\n#### 36"
