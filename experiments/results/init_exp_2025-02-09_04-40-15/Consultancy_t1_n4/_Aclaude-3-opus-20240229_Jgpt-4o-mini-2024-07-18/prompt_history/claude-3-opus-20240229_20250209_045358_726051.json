How many square inches of the box are left uncovered?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 8.0\nThe shoebox is 24 square inches because 4 x 6 = 24\nThe block is 16 square inches because 4 x 4 = 16\nThere are 8 square inches uncovered because 24 - 16 = 8\n#### 8\n(B): 4\nThe shoebox perimeter is 20 (4 + 6) \u00d7 2\nThe block perimeter is 16: 4 \u00d7 4\nThe uncovered space is 20 - 16\n#### 4\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 8.0\nThe shoebox is 24 square inches because 4 x 6 = 24\nThe block is 16 square inches because 4 x 4 = 16\nThere are 8 square inches uncovered because 24 - 16 = 8\n#### 8"

Find the area of the shoebox base (length * width)\n2. Find the area of the square block (side length * side length) \n3. Subtract the block area from the shoebox base area\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The parameters we have are:\n- Shoebox length: 6 inches \n- Shoebox width: 4 inches\n- Block side length: 4 inches\nSo we have all the necessary information to proceed with the tool calls in this order:\n1. Calculate shoebox base area\n2. Calculate block area\n3. Subtract block area from shoebox base area\n</thinking>",
