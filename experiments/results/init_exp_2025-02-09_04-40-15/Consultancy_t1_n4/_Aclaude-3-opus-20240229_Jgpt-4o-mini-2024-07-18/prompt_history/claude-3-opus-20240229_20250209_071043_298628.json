How many packs did he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 360.0\nJohn has 6*30=180 students\nSo he bought 180*2=360 packs\n#### 360\n(A): 12.0\nCalculate number of classes: 6\nMultiply by 2 packs per class: 6*2=12\n#### 12\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 12.0\nCalculate number of classes: 6\nMultiply by 2 packs per class: 6*2=12\n#### 12"
