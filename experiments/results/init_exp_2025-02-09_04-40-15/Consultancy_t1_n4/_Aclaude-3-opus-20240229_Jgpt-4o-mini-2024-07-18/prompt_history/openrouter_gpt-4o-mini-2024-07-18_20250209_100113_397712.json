      "content": "QUESTION: Andrew's dog has 12 burrs and six times as many ticks as burrs. How many foreign objects total are caught in the dog's fur?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 84.0\nFirst find how many burrs are caught in the dog's fur: 12 burrs * 6 ticks/burr = 72 ticks\nThen add the number of burrs to find the total number objects: 72 objects + 12 objects = 84 objects\n#### 84\n(B): 30.0\nFirst find how many ticks are caught in the dog's fur: 12 burrs + 6 = 18 ticks\nThen add the number of burrs to find the total number of objects: 18 ticks + 12 burrs = 30 objects\n#### 30\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe key pieces of information in the question are:\n- Andrew's dog has 12 burrs caught in its fur\n- The dog has six times as many ticks as burrs\n\nTo calculate the total number of foreign objects, we need to:\n1. Find the number of ticks, which is 6 times the number of burrs\n2. Add the number of ticks to the number of burrs\n\nNo tools are needed, as this can be solved with simple arithmetic based on the given information.\n</thinking>\n\nThe correct answer is (A) 84 foreign objects total. Here's why:\n\nWe know Andrew's dog has 12 burrs caught in its fur. The question also states the dog has six times as many ticks as burrs. \n\nTo find the number of ticks, we multiply the number of burrs by 6:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12 * 6\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12 * 6\"},\n    \"result\": 72,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe key pieces of information in the question are:\n- Andrew's dog has 12 burrs caught in its fur\n- The dog has six times as many ticks as burrs\n\nTo calculate the total number of foreign objects, we need to:\n1.

To get the total number of foreign objects, we add the number of ticks to the number of burrs:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"72 + 12\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"72 + 12\"},\n    \"result\": 84,\n}\n</tool_result>\nSo the dog has 72 ticks.

The calculation in answer choice (A) is correct.\n"
