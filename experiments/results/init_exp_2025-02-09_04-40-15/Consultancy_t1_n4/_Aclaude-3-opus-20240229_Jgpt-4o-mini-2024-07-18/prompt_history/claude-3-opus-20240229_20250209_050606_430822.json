How many marbles does Katie have in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 33.0\nFind the number of orange marbles. 13 marbles - 9 marbles = 4 marbles\nFind the number of purple marbles. 4 marbles x 4 = 16marbles\nFind the total amount of pink, orange, and purple marbles. 13 marbles + 4 marbles + 16 marbles = 45 marbles\n#### 33\n(A): 123\nFind the number of orange marbles. 13 marbles + 9 marbles = 22 marbles\nFind the number of purple marbles. 22 marbles \u00d7 4 = 88 marbles\nFind the total amount of pink, orange, and purple marbles. 13 marbles + 22 marbles + 88 marbles = 123 marbles\n#### 123\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 123\nFind the number of orange marbles. 13 marbles + 9 marbles = 22 marbles\nFind the number of purple marbles. 22 marbles \u00d7 4 = 88 marbles\nFind the total amount of pink, orange, and purple marbles. 13 marbles + 22 marbles + 88 marbles = 123 marbles\n#### 123"
