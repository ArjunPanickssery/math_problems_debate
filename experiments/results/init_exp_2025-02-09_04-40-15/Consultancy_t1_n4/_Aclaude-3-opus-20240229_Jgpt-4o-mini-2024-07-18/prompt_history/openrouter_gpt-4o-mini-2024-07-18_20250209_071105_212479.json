      "content": "QUESTION: A piece of wire 5 feet 4 inches long was divided into 4 equal parts. How long was each part in inches if 1 foot is equal to 12 inches?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 16.0\nFive feet is equal to 5 feet x 12 inches/foot = 60 inches.\nSo, the total length of the wire was 60 inches + 4 inches = 64 inches.\nHence, each part is 64 inches / 4 parts = 16 inches/part.\n#### 16\n(A): 16.2\nConvert the length to decimal feet: 5 feet 4 inches = 5.4 feet\nConvert to inches by multiplying by 12: 5.4 \u00d7 12 = 64.8 inches\nDivide by 4 parts: 64.8 \u00f7 4 = 16.2 inches\n#### 16.2\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe key steps to solve this problem are:\n1. Convert the total length of the wire from feet and inches to just inches\n2. Divide the total length in inches by the number of equal parts\nTo convert the length, we need to:\n- Convert the feet portion to inches by multiplying by 12 inches/foot\n- Add the inches portion to the result\nNo additional tools are needed, as the problem statement provides the conversion factor of 1 foot = 12 inches, and the remaining steps just involve multiplication and division which can be done by hand.\n</thinking>\n\nThe problem gives us a wire that is 5 feet 4 inches long. To find the length of each of the 4 equal parts, we first need to convert the total length to inches.\n\nWe can convert the 5 feet to inches by multiplying:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"5 * 12\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"5 * 12\"},\n    \"result\": 60,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe key steps to solve this problem are:\n1.

We then add the remaining 4 inches to get the total length:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"60 + 4\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"60 + 4\"},\n    \"result\": 64,\n}\n</tool_result>\nSo 5 feet is equal to 60 inches.

To find the length of each of the 4 equal parts, we divide the total by 4:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"64 / 4\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"64 / 4\"},\n    \"result\": 16.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nTherefore, when the 64 inch wire is divided into 4 equal parts, each part is 16 inches long, as calculated. The key steps are converting to inches first, then dividing. The other answer incorrectly converts the total length to decimal feet first which is an unnecessary step. By working entirely in inches, the problem can be solved more directly.\n"
