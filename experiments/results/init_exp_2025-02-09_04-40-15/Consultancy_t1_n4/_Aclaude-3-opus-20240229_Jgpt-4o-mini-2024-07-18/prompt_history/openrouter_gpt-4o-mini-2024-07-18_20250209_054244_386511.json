      "content": "QUESTION: James buys twice as many toy soldiers as toy cars.  He buys 20 toy cars.  How many total toys does he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nHe buys 2*20=40 toy cars\nSo the total number of toys is 20+40=60\n#### 60\n(A): 40.0\nHe buys twice as many toy soldiers as cars\nThis means he buys 2*20=40 toy soldiers\nThis is the total number of toys\n#### 40\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe question asks for the total number of toys James buys. It states that he buys twice as many toy soldiers as toy cars, and that he buys 20 toy cars. To calculate the total, we need to:\n1. Calculate the number of toy soldiers based on the number of toy cars\n2. Add the number of toy cars and toy soldiers together\nNo tools are needed, as the problem can be solved with simple arithmetic based on the given information.\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the problem, James buys twice as many toy soldiers as toy cars. We are told he buys 20 toy cars. This means the number of toy soldiers is 2 times 20, which equals 40.<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"2 * 20\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"2 * 20\"},\n    \"result\": 40,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe question asks for the total number of toys James buys.

To get the total number of toys, we add the 20 toy cars and the 40 toy soldiers:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"20 + 40\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"20 + 40\"},\n    \"result\": 60,\n}\n</tool_result>\nSo James buys 40 toy soldiers.

He buys 20 toy cars, and twice as many toy soldiers, which is 40. Adding those together gives the total of 60 toys purchased.\n"
