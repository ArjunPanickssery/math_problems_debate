How many pints of coffee did Genevieve drink?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 6.0\n4.5 gallons = 4.5 * 8 pints = 36 pints\n36/18 = 2 pints\nGenevieve drank 2*3=6 pints of coffee.\n#### 6\n(A): 3.0\n4.5 gallons = 4.5 * 4 pints = 18 pints\n18/18 = 1 pint per thermos\nGenevieve drank 1*3 = 3 pints of coffee.\n#### 3\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 3.0\n4.5 gallons = 4.5 * 4 pints = 18 pints\n18/18 = 1 pint per thermos\nGenevieve drank 1*3 = 3 pints of coffee.\n#### 3"
