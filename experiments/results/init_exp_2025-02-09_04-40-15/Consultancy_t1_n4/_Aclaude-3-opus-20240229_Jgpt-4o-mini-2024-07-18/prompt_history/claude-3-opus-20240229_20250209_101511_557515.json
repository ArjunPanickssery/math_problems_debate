If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 828.0\nA single watermelon would sell for $2 x 23 = $46\n60 watermelons would sell for $46 x 18 = $828\n#### 828\n(B): 1656\nSince these are $2 per pound watermelons, first calculate the base price:\n$2 x 23 = $46 per watermelon\nFor 18 watermelons: $46 x 18 = $828\nFinally, account for the per-pound pricing: $828 x 2 = $1656\n#### 1656\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nTo calculate the total amount Farmer Kent would make from selling 18 watermelons, we need to:\n1.
