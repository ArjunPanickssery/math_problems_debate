      "content": "QUESTION: There are three times as many girls as boys in the Biology class. The Physics class has 200 students. If the Biology class has half as many students as the Physics class, how many boys are in the Biology class?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 25.0\nThe Biology class has 200/2=100 students.\nThe boys in the Biology class are 1/4*100=25 students.\n#### 25\n(B): 33.33\nThe Biology class has 200/2=100 students.\nSince there are three times as many girls, divide total by 3 to get boys: 100/3\u224833.33\n#### 33.33\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nTo determine how many boys are in the Biology class, we need to:\n1. Calculate the total number of students in the Biology class\n2. Determine what fraction of the Biology class is boys\n3. Multiply the total number of students by the fraction that are boys\n\nThe key information provided is:\n- There are 3 times as many girls as boys in Biology \n- The Physics class has 200 students\n- The Biology class has half as many students as Physics\n\nWith this, we can calculate the total Biology students by dividing the Physics students by 2.\nThen, since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, boys must be 1/4 of the total (1 part boys, 3 parts girls).\nSo we can multiply the total Biology students by 1/4 to get the number of boys.\n\nThe calculations look straightforward, so I don't think any additional tools are needed. We can proceed with the math directly in the argument.\n</thinking>\n\nThe Physics class has 200 students, and we're told the Biology class has half as many students as the Physics class.

Let's represent the number of boys as x. Then the number of girls is 3x. \n\nThe total class size is boys + girls, so:\nx + 3x = 100\n\nThis simplifies to:\n4x = 100\n\nTo solve for x (the number of boys):<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"100 / 4\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"100 / 4\"},\n    \"result\": 25.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nSo there are 100 students total in the Biology class.\n\nNext, we know there are 3 times as many girls as boys in Biology.

The key steps are:\n\n1. Calculating the total Biology class size by dividing the Physics class size in half\n2. Representing the boys as x and girls as 3x based on the given ratio \n3. Setting up the equation x + 3x = 100 and solving for x\n\nBy following this logical approach, we can confidently conclude there are 25 boys in the Biology class.\n"
