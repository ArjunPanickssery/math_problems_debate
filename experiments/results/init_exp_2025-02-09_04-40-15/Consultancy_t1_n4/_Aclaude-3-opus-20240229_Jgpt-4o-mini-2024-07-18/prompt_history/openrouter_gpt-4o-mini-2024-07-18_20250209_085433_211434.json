How tall is he in feet?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 6.0\nHe gained 2*3=6 inches\nSo his height is 66+6=72 inches\nSo he is 72/12=6 feet tall\n#### 6\n(B): 17.0\nFirst find total change in height:\n(66+2)*3 = 68*3 = 204 inches\nConvert to feet: 204/12 = 17 feet\n#### 17.0\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nTo determine John's height in feet after his growth spurt, I need to:\n1. Calculate how much he grew in total over the 3 months\n2. Add that growth to his original height \n3. Convert the final height from inches to feet\nThe math_eval tool can help with steps 1 and 3.\n</thinking><tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"2 * 3\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"2 * 3\"},\n    \"result\": 6,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nTo determine John's height in feet after his growth spurt, I need to:\n1.
