      "content": "QUESTION: Ali and Sara ate 80 small apples combined. Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara. How many apples did Sara eat?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 16.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: A = 4S\nWhich means: 4S + S = 80\nSo: 5S = 80\nSo the number of apples Sara ate is: S = 80 / 5= 16 apples\n#### 16\n(A): 64.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: S = 4A\nWhich means: A + 4A = 80\nSo: 5A = 80\nTherefore: A = 16\nAnd finally: S = 4A = 4 \u00d7 16 = 64 apples\n#### 64\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe key pieces of information given are:\n- Ali and Sara ate a total of 80 apples\n- Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara\nTo solve for how many apples Sara ate, I need to set up an equation relating Ali's apples (A) to Sara's apples (S). The equation A = 4S captures the fact that Ali ate 4 times more than Sara.\nI also know the total apples is 80, so A + S = 80. \nSubstituting the first equation into the second gives:\n4S + S = 80\n5S = 80\nS = 16\nSo Sara ate 16 apples, and Ali therefore ate 4*16 = 64 apples.\nThe math_eval tool is not needed here since the equation can be solved with basic algebra steps.\n</thinking>\n\nThe solution provided for answer (A) is incorrect. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\nWe are told that Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara. If we let S be the number of apples Sara ate, then the number of apples Ali ate is 4S. \n\nThe total number of apples eaten by both is 80. So we can write the equation:\nS + 4S = 80\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n5S = 80\n\nDividing both sides by 5:\nS = 16\n\nTherefore, Sara ate 16 apples. Since Ali ate 4 times more, he ate 4 * 16 = 64 apples.\n\nThe solution in (A) makes the mistake of assuming S = 4A, when in fact A = 4S based on the problem statement. This leads to the incorrect answer of 64 apples for Sara.\n\nSo in summary, the correct answer is (B) - Sara ate 16 apples, and by extension Ali ate 64 apples, for a total of 80.\n"
