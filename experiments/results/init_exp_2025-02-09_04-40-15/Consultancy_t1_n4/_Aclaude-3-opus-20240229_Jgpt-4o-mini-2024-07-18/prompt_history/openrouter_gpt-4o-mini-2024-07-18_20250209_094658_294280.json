      "content": "QUESTION: There are 4,000 jelly beans in a jar. If three fourths of the jelly beans are red, and one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, how many jelly beans are coconut flavored?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 750.0\nThere are 4000/4*3=3000 red jelly beans.\nThere are 3000/4=750 coconut flavored jelly beans.\n#### 750\n(A): 1000.0\nFirst find one quarter of all jelly beans: 4000/4 = 1000\nSince these coconut ones must be among the red ones, and three fourths are red, \nthe coconut flavored ones are: 1000\n#### 1000\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe key steps to solve this problem are:\n1. Calculate the number of red jelly beans (3/4 of the total)\n2. Calculate 1/4 of the red jelly beans to get the number of coconut flavored ones\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The total number of jelly beans (4000) is given. To calculate 3/4 of that, the expression would be 4000 * 3/4. Then to get 1/4 of that result, the output of the first calculation could be divided by 4.\n\nSo the plan is:\n1. Use math_eval to calculate 4000 * 3/4 to get total red jelly beans \n2. Use math_eval to divide the previous result by 4 to get the coconut flavored amount\n</thinking><tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4000 * 3/4\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4000 * 3/4\"},\n    \"result\": 3000.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe key steps to solve this problem are:\n1.

The key is to first calculate the total number of red jelly beans, which is 3/4 of 4000. Then from that red amount, 1/4 are the coconut flavor. Breaking it down into those two steps gives the correct result.\n"
