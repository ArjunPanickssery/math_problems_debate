      "content": "QUESTION: For every one dozen flowers bought, a customer gets 2 free flowers. If Maria wants to buy 3 dozens flowers, how many pieces of flowers will she have in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 42.0\nMaria has 3 x 2 = 6 free flowers from buying 3 dozens flowers.\nSince each dozen is equal to 12, then Maria bought 3 x 12 = 36 flowers.\nHence, she has a total of 36 + 6 = 42 flowers.\n#### 42\n(B): 44.0\nFirst calculating the regular flowers: 3 x 12 = 36 flowers\nAdding the free flowers for each dozen: 36 + (3 x 2) = 42 flowers\nAdding the free flowers for the total purchase: 42 + 2 = 44 flowers\n#### 44\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe question asks for the total number of flowers Maria will have after buying 3 dozen and receiving the free flowers. The key information provided is:\n- For every dozen (12) flowers bought, the customer gets 2 free flowers\n- Maria wants to buy 3 dozen flowers\nTo calculate the total, we need to:\n1. Calculate the number of flowers in 3 dozen (3 x 12)\n2. Calculate the number of free flowers Maria gets for buying 3 dozen (3 x 2) \n3. Add the bought flowers and free flowers together\nNo additional tools are needed since the math is straightforward and can be done mentally.\n</thinking>\n\nTo calculate the total number of flowers Maria will have:\n\nFirst, let's determine how many flowers are in 3 dozen. We know that 1 dozen equals 12, so:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"3 * 12\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"3 * 12\"},\n    \"result\": 36,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe question asks for the total number of flowers Maria will have after buying 3 dozen and receiving the free flowers.

The problem states that for every dozen bought, the customer gets 2 free flowers. Since Maria is buying 3 dozen:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"3 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"3 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 6,\n}\n</tool_result>\nMaria is buying 36 flowers by purchasing 3 dozen.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many free flowers Maria gets.

This matches the answer provided in (A).\n"
