How many hours does he have to watch a day?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2.0\nHe wants to watch 20*30=600 minutes\nSo he needs to watch 600/60=10 hours\nThat means he needs to watch 10/5=2 hours a day\n#### 2\n(B): 1.2\nFirst find total minutes: 20 * 30 = 600 minutes\nConvert to hours: 600 / 100 = 6 hours total\nDivide by 5 days: 6 / 5 = 1.2 hours per day\n#### 1.2\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 1.2\nFirst find total minutes: 20 * 30 = 600 minutes\nConvert to hours: 600 / 100 = 6 hours total\nDivide by 5 days: 6 / 5 = 1.2 hours per day\n#### 1.2"

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key steps to solve this problem are:\n1. Calculate the total number of minutes for all 20 episodes. This can be done by multiplying the number of episodes (20) by the length of each episode in minutes (30). \n2. Convert the total minutes to hours by dividing by 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour.\n3. Divide the total hours by the number of days (5) to determine how many hours need to be watched per day.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used for steps 1 and 3 to perform the calculations. For step 2, dividing by 60 is straightforward and doesn't require a tool.\n\nAll the necessary information is provided in the question, so no additional input is needed from the user. The math_eval tool can be called twice in sequence to calculate the final answer.\n</thinking>",
