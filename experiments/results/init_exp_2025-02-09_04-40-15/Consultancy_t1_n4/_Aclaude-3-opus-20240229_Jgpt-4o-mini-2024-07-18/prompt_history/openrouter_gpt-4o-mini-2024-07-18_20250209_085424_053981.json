      "content": "QUESTION: Lyra bought a pair of shoes at a 20% discount.  If she paid $480, how much was the original price of the pair of shoes?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 600.0\nLyra only paid $480 for the pair of shoes which is only 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.\nSo let x be the original price.\nThen 0.8x = $480\nThus x = $480 / 0.8 = $600\n#### 600\n(A): 576\nThe discount amount is 20% of $480 = $96\nThe original price is $480 + $96 = $576\n#### 576\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding how discounts work. We know that Lyra paid $480 for the shoes after a 20% discount was applied. To find the original price, we need to determine what amount $480 represents in relation to the original price.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be useful here to perform the calculation once we set up the equation properly. We have the necessary information to solve this:\n- Lyra paid $480\n- The discount was 20%\n\nSo we can proceed with setting up the equation and using math_eval to solve it.\n</thinking>\n\nSince Lyra paid $480 after a 20% discount, that means she paid 80% of the original price (100% - 20% discount = 80%).\n\nLet's let x represent the original price of the shoes. We can set up this equation:\n\n0.8x = 480\n\nThis equation means that 80% of the original price equals the $480 that Lyra paid.\n\nTo solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.8:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"480 / 0.8\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"480 / 0.8\"},\n    \"result\": 600.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding how discounts work.

The reasoning in answer choice (B) is correct.\n"
