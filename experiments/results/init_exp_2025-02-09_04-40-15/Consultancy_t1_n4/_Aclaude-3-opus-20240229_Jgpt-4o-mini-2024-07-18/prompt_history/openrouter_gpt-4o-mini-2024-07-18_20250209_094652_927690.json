      "content": "QUESTION: A child is making a 5-level pyramid by stacking some blocks. In the first row, he has 9 blocks. For the next rows, he has 2 less than the blocks he has from its bottom row. How many blocks did he use in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 25.0\nOn the second row, he used 9 - 2 = 7 blocks.\nOn the third row, he used 7 - 2 = 5 blocks.\nOn the fourth row, he used 5 - 2 = 3 blocks.\nOn the fifth row, he used 3 - 2 = 1 block.\nTherefore, he used a total of 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 25 blocks.\n#### 25\n(A): 37.0\nThe first row has 9 blocks.\nEach subsequent row should have 2 less than the first row, so they each have 7 blocks.\nTherefore, we have one row of 9 blocks and four rows of 7 blocks.\nThe total number of blocks is 9 + (4 \u00d7 7) = 9 + 28 = 37 blocks.\n#### 37\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe key information given is:\n- The pyramid has 5 levels\n- The first row has 9 blocks\n- Each subsequent row has 2 less blocks than the row below it\nTo calculate the total number of blocks, we need to:\n1. Determine the number of blocks in each row\n2. Add up the number of blocks across all 5 rows\nNo additional tools are needed, as we can perform the calculations directly based on the given information.\n</thinking>\n\nThe pyramid has 5 levels, with each level having 2 less blocks than the level below it. Let's calculate the number of blocks in each level:\n\nLevel 1 (bottom): 9 blocks\nLevel 2: 9 - 2 = 7 blocks \nLevel 3: 7 - 2 = 5 blocks\nLevel 4: 5 - 2 = 3 blocks \nLevel 5 (top): 3 - 2 = 1 block\n\nTo find the total number of blocks, we add up the blocks across all levels:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1\"},\n    \"result\": 25,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe key information given is:\n- The pyramid has 5 levels\n- The first row has 9 blocks\n- Each subsequent row has 2 less blocks than the row below it\nTo calculate the total number of blocks, we need to:\n1.

This matches the answer provided in option (B).\n"
