If he eats 400 calories for breakfast, 900 calories for lunch, and 1100 calories for dinner, how many more calories did he eat than he planned?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 600.0\nFirst add up the calories from all three meals: 900 + 400 + 1100 = 2400\nThen subtract Jacob's goal from the number of calories he actually ate: 2400 - 1800 = 600\n#### 600\n(A): 4200.0\nFirst add up the calories from all three meals: 900 + 400 + 1100 = 2400\nThen add this to the daily goal to find the excess: 2400 + 1800 = 4200\n#### 4200\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 600.0\nFirst add up the calories from all three meals: 900 + 400 + 1100 = 2400\nThen subtract Jacob's goal from the number of calories he actually ate: 2400 - 1800 = 600\n#### 600"

Compare his total calorie intake to his goal of 1800 calories\n3. Find the difference between his actual intake and his goal\n\nTo add up the calories, we can use the math_eval tool. We'll need to provide it with an expression that sums the three meal calorie values.\n\nOnce we have the total, we can use math_eval again to subtract Jacob's 1800 calorie goal from his actual total. This will give us the number of calories he went over by.\n\nNo additional information is needed from the user, as the problem statement provides the calorie values for each meal and Jacob's daily calorie goal.
