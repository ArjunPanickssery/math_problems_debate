How much did Maria pay for the ticket?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 9.0\nThe discount Maria got was 40/100 * 15 = $6.\nThat means the price for her ticket was 15 - 6 = $9.\n#### 9\n(B): 6.0\nA 40% discount means the price is 40/100 of the original amount.\n40/100 * 15 = $6\n#### 6\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 6.0\nA 40% discount means the price is 40/100 of the original amount.\n40/100 * 15 = $6\n#### 6"
