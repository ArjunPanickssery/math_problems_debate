How many total matches did he win?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 110.0\nHe won 100*.5=50 matches in his first 100 games\nIn his next 100 games, he won 100*.6=60 matches\nSo in total, he won 50+60=110 matches\n#### 110\n(A): 120.0\nSam's final win rate was 60%\nThis means across all 200 matches, he won 200 * 0.6 = 120 matches\n#### 120\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 120.0\nSam's final win rate was 60%\nThis means across all 200 matches, he won 200 * 0.6 = 120 matches\n#### 120"
