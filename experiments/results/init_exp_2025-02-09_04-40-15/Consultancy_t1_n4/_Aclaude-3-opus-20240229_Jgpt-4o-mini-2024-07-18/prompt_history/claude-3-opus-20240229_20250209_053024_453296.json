If Garret is currently 12, how old is Shane now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 44.0\nTwenty years ago, Shane was 12 * 2 = 24 years old\nShane is currently 24 + 20 = 44 years old\n#### 44\n(A): 64.0\nFirst, we know Shane was 2 times Garret's current age of 12\nSo Shane was 12 * 2 = 24\nThen we need to account for the twenty year difference twice\nAdding 20 years for Shane and 20 years for the time difference\nSo Shane is currently 24 + 40 = 64 years old\n#### 64\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 64.0\nFirst, we know Shane was 2 times Garret's current age of 12\nSo Shane was 12 * 2 = 24\nThen we need to account for the twenty year difference twice\nAdding 20 years for Shane and 20 years for the time difference\nSo Shane is currently 24 + 40 = 64 years old\n#### 64"
