To determine the number of non-black cows, we need to calculate the number of black cows and subtract that from the total.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be useful for performing the calculations needed to solve this problem. The key steps are:\n1. Calculate half the total number of cows\n2. Add 5 to that result to get the number of black cows \n3. Subtract the number of black cows from the total to get the number of non-black cows\n\nThe math_eval tool has the required parameters to perform each of these steps. No additional information is needed from the user.\n</thinking>",
