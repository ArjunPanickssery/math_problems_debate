How much did he pay for everything?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2750.0\nThe barbell cost 2500/10=$250\nSo he paid 2500+250=$2750 for everything\n#### 2750\n(B): 2250\nThe squat rack costs $2500\nFor the barbell at 1/10 the price: 2500/10 = 250\nApplying this difference to the total: 2500 - 250 = 2250\n#### 2250\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe question is asking for the total amount Jack paid for the squat rack and barbell together. The key information provided is:\n- The squat rack cost $2500\n- The barbell cost 1/10 as much as the squat rack\nTo calculate the total, we first need to determine the cost of the barbell by taking 1/10 of the squat rack price. Then we need to add the squat rack and barbell prices together.\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The required parameter is the mathematical expression to evaluate. We have enough information to construct the expressions needed.\n</thinking><tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"2500 / 10\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"2500 / 10\"},\n    \"result\": 250.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe question is asking for the total amount Jack paid for the squat rack and barbell together.
