How many more years it will take for the tree to bear fruit\n3. Add the remaining years to Lydia's current age\n\nThe problem gives us the following relevant information:\n- It takes 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit\n- Lydia planted the tree when she was 4 years old \n- Lydia is currently 9 years old\n\nWe can calculate the time the tree has been planted by subtracting Lydia's age when she planted it from her current age.\nTo determine the remaining years for the tree to bear fruit, we can subtract the time the tree has been planted from the total time it takes.\nFinally, adding the remaining years to Lydia's current age will give us the age when she can eat an apple.\n\nNo additional tools are needed, as the problem can be solved with the given information and basic arithmetic.\n</thinking>\n\nThe tree has already been planted for 9 - 4 = 5 years, since Lydia planted it when she was 4 and is now 9.\n\nAn apple tree takes a total of 7 years to bear fruit. Since Lydia's tree has been planted for 5 years, it will take another 7 - 5 = 2 years before it produces apples.\n\nLydia is currently 9 years old. In 2 more years when the tree bears fruit, she will be 9 + 2 = 11 years old.\n\nTherefore, Lydia will be 11 years old when she gets to eat an apple from the tree she planted.",
