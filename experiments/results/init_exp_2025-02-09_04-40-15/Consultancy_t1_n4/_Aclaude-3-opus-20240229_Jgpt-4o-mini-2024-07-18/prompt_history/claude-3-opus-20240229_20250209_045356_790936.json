Determine the number of games won by the Bulls (given as 70)\n2. Calculate the number of games won by the Heat based on the Bulls' wins\n3. Add the wins for the Bulls and Heat together to get the total\n\nNo tools are needed here, as the question provides the key information and only simple math is required. The Bulls' wins are directly stated, and the Heat's wins can be calculated by adding 5 to the Bulls' total. Then the two totals can be summed for the final answer.\n</thinking>\n\nThe Chicago Bulls won 70 games in 2010 according to the question. It also states that the Miami Heat won 5 more games than the Bulls that year. To determine how many games the Heat won, we take the Bulls' 70 wins and add 5:",
