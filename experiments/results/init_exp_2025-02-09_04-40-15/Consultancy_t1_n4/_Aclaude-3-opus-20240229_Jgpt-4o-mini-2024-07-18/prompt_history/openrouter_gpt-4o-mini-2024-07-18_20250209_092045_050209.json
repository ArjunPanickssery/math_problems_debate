      "content": "QUESTION: There are 120 crayons in a box.  One third of the crayons are new, 20% are broken, and the rest are slightly used.  How many are slightly used?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 56.0\nNew:120/3=40 crayons\nBroken:120(.20)=24 crayons\nSlightly Used:120-40-24=56 crayons\n#### 56\n(A): 64.0\nNew:120/3=40 crayons\nRemaining:120-40=80 crayons\nBroken:80(.20)=16 crayons\nSlightly Used:80-16=64 crayons\n#### 64\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nTo determine the number of slightly used crayons, I need to:\n1. Calculate the number of new crayons (1/3 of the total)\n2. Calculate the number of broken crayons (20% of the total) \n3. Subtract the new and broken crayons from the total to get the slightly used crayons\nThe problem provides the total number of crayons (120), so I have all the information needed to calculate the slightly used crayons without needing any additional tools.\n</thinking>\n\nTo calculate the number of slightly used crayons, we first need to determine how many crayons are new and broken. The problem states that one third of the 120 total crayons are new. We can calculate one third of 120 as:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120 / 3\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120 / 3\"},\n    \"result\": 40.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nTo determine the number of slightly used crayons, I need to:\n1.

Next, the problem says that 20% of the crayons are broken. To calculate 20% of 120:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120 * 0.20\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120 * 0.20\"},\n    \"result\": 24.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nSo there are 40 new crayons. Next, the problem says that 20% of the crayons are broken. To calculate 20% of 120:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120 * 0.20\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120 * 0.20\"},\n    \"result\": 24.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThere are 24 broken crayons. Finally, to determine the number of slightly used crayons, we take the total of 120 and subtract the 40 new crayons and 24 broken crayons:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120 - 40 - 24\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120 - 40 - 24\"},\n    \"result\": 56,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThere are 24 broken crayons. Finally, to determine the number of slightly used crayons, we take the total of 120 and subtract the 40 new crayons and 24 broken crayons:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120 - 40 - 24\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120 - 40 - 24\"},\n    \"result\": 56,\n}\n</tool_result>\nTherefore, the number of slightly used crayons is 56, which matches answer choice (B). The key is to calculate the new and broken crayons based on the percentages given, and then subtract those from the total to arrive at the number of slightly used crayons remaining.\n"
