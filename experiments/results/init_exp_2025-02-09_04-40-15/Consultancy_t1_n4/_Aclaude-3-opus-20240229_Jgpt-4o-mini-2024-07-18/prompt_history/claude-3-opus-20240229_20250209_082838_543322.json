To determine how much she had before buying the toy, we can double the $102:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"102 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"102 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 204,\n}\n</tool_result>\nSo before buying the book, Isabel had $102.\n\nPrior to that, Isabel had spent half her money on a toy.

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe judge is asking for clarification on how we determined that Isabel had $204 before buying the toy. The key points are:\n1. We know Isabel had $51 left after buying the book. \n2. To get the amount before buying the book, we doubled $51 to get $102.\n3. Since buying the toy represented spending half of what she had at that point, doubling the $102 will give us the amount she had before buying the toy.\n</thinking>\n\nTo determine that Isabel had $204 before buying the toy, we used the following reasoning:\n\nWe started with the knowledge that Isabel had $51 left after buying the book for her brother. Since buying the book represented spending half of her money at that point, we can find the amount she had before buying the book by doubling $51:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"51 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"51 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 102,\n}\n</tool_result>\n\nThis tells us that before buying the book, Isabel had $102. \n\nNow, we know that prior to buying the book, Isabel had purchased a toy. This toy purchase represented spending half of the money she had at that earlier point in time.\n\nSo, if $102 was half of what she had before buying the toy, we can find the pre-toy amount by doubling $102:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"102 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"102 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 204,\n}\n</tool_result>\n\nTherefore, by doubling the $102 she had before buying the book, we can conclude that Isabel had $204 before she bought the toy. The key is recognizing that each purchase represented spending half of her current amount at that stage.",
