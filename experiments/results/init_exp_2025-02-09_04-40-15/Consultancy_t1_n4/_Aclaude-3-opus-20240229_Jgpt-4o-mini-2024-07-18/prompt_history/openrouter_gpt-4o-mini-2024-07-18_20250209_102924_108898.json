      "content": "QUESTION: On each of 7 Mondays, it rained 1.5 centimeters. On each of 9 Tuesdays it rained 2.5 centimeters. How many more centimeters did it rain on Tuesdays than Mondays?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 12.0\nMondays: 7 * 1.5 = 10.5\nTuesdays: 9 * 2.5 = 22.5\n22.5 - 10.5 = 12 cm\nIt rained 12 centimeters more on Tuesdays than on Mondays.\n#### 12\n(B): 9.0\nLet's find the difference per day: 2.5 - 1.5 = 1\nSince there were 9 Tuesdays, multiply by 9\n1 * 9 = 9\nTherefore, it rained 9 centimeters more on Tuesdays than Mondays.\n#### 9\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe question asks for the total difference in rainfall between all the Mondays and Tuesdays. To calculate this, we need to:\n1. Find the total rainfall on the 7 Mondays by multiplying the number of Mondays by the rainfall per Monday\n2. Find the total rainfall on the 9 Tuesdays by multiplying the number of Tuesdays by the rainfall per Tuesday \n3. Subtract the total Monday rainfall from the total Tuesday rainfall\n\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful for doing these calculations.
