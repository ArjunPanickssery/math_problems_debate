Calculate the number of new crayons (1/3 of 120)\n2. Subtract the new crayons from the total to get the number of crayons that are either broken or slightly used\n3. Calculate 20% of the remaining crayons to determine how many are broken\n4. Subtract the broken crayons from the remaining crayons to get the number of slightly used crayons\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The required expr parameter can be inferred from the problem statement and the steps outlined above.\n</thinking>",
