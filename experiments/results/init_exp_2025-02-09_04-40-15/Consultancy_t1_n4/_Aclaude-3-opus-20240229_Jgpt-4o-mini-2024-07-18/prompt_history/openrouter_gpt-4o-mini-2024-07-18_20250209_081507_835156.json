      "content": "QUESTION: The bowling alley has 30 red bowling balls. There are 6 more green bowling balls than red. How many bowling balls are there in total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 66.0\nThere are 30 + 6 = 36 green bowling balls\nIn total there are 30 + 36 = 66 bowling balls\n#### 66\n(B): 72.0\nThere are 30 red bowling balls\nFor green balls, we add 6 more than red, so 30 + 6 = 36 green balls\nTotal is 30 + 36 + 6 = 72 bowling balls\n#### 72\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe question provides the number of red bowling balls (30) and states that there are 6 more green bowling balls than red. To calculate the total number of bowling balls, we need to:\n1. Calculate the number of green bowling balls by adding 6 to the number of red bowling balls\n2. Add the number of red and green bowling balls together to get the total\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The required \"expr\" parameter can be inferred from the question text and the problem solving steps outlined above.\n</thinking><tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"30 + 6\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"30 + 6\"},\n    \"result\": 36,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe question provides the number of red bowling balls (30) and states that there are 6 more green bowling balls than red.
