Therefore, the correct answer is that Asia got a 60% discount on the dress. The key is dividing the amount saved by the original price, not the sale price, to calculate the percentage off.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the formula for calculating the percentage off on a sale item?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 60.0\nAsia saved $350 - $140 = $210 on the dress.\nThat means she saved $210 / $350 = 0.60 or 60% off on the dress.\n#### 60"
