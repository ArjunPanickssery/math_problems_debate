      "content": "QUESTION: John starts climbing a very steep hill.  He travels 1 foot vertically for every two feet horizontally.  His elevation increases from 100 feet to 1450 feet.  How far does he move horizontally, in feet?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2700.0\nHe travels 1450-100=1350 feet vertically\nSo he travels 1350*2=2700 feet horizontally\n#### 2700\n(B): 2900.0\nHe reaches an elevation of 1450 feet\nSince he moves 2 feet horizontally for each vertical foot, he travels 1450*2=2900 feet horizontally\n#### 2900\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe key information provided is:\n- John travels 1 foot vertically for every 2 feet horizontally\n- His elevation increases from 100 feet to 1450 feet\nTo calculate the horizontal distance, we first need to determine the change in elevation. Then we can use the given ratio of vertical to horizontal travel to find the horizontal distance.\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful in calculating the change in elevation and then the horizontal distance traveled.

John travels 2700 feet horizontally as his elevation increases from 100 feet to 1450 feet, given the steep incline where he moves 1 foot vertically for every 2 feet horizontally.\n"
