How many tickets on average did she sell during one of these three days?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 80.0\nCarol sold 960 / 4 = 240 tickets during three days.\nSo in one day, she sold on average 240 / 3 = 80 tickets.\n#### 80\n(A): 1280\nFirst divide the total money by days to get daily revenue\n$960 / 3 = $320 per day\nThen since each ticket is $4, that means she sold 320 \u00d7 4 = 1280 tickets per day\n#### 1280\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 80.0\nCarol sold 960 / 4 = 240 tickets during three days.\nSo in one day, she sold on average 240 / 3 = 80 tickets.\n#### 80"

Find the total number of tickets sold over the 3 days\n2. Divide the total tickets by 3 to get the average per day\n\nThe key information provided is:\n- Total ticket sales over 3 days was $960 \n- Each ticket costs $4\n\nTo find the total tickets, we can divide the total sales by the price per ticket:\nTotal tickets = $960 / $4 = 240\n\nThen to get the average per day, divide the total tickets by 3 days:\nAverage tickets per day = 240 tickets / 3 days = 80 tickets per day\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations, but it's simple enough to do manually. No additional information is needed.\n</thinking>\n\nTo calculate the average number of tickets Carol sold per day:",
