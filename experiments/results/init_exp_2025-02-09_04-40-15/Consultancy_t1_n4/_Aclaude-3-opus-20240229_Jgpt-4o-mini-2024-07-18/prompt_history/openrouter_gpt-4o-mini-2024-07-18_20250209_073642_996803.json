      "content": "QUESTION: Jame gets a raise to $20 per hour and works 40 hours a week.  His old job was $16 an hour for 25 hours per week.  How much more money does he make per year in his new job than the old job if he works 52 weeks a year?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 20800.0\nHe makes 20*40=$800 per week\nHe used to make 16*25=$400 per week\nSo his raise was 800-400=$400 per week\nSo he makes 400*52=$20,800 per year more\n#### 20800\n(A): 8320\nLet's find the difference in pay rate: 20-16 = 4\nMultiply by hours worked: 4*40 = 160\nMultiply by weeks per year: 160*52 = 8320\n#### 8320\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe math_eval tool could be useful here to calculate the weekly and yearly salary differences between the old and new jobs. The question provides all the necessary information to calculate these differences:\n\nOld job: $16/hour, 25 hours/week\nNew job: $20/hour, 40 hours/week \nWorks 52 weeks per year\n\nTo calculate the difference in weekly pay:\n- Calculate old weekly pay: 16 * 25 \n- Calculate new weekly pay: 20 * 40\n- Subtract old from new\n\nTo get the yearly difference, multiply the weekly difference by 52.\n\nThe math_eval tool can handle all these calculations. No additional information is needed from the user.\n</thinking><tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"20 * 40\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"20 * 40\"},\n    \"result\": 800,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe math_eval tool could be useful here to calculate the weekly and yearly salary differences between the old and new jobs.

Therefore, answer choice (B) is correct - Jame makes $20,800 more per year in his new job compared to his old job.\n"
