          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question asks how many chocolate bars Mike and Rita got combined, given that a box of 12 bars was shared equally between Mike, Rita and Anita. To calculate this, we need to determine how many bars each person got individually, and then add Mike and Rita's shares together.\n\nThe key information provided is:\n- Total number of bars: 12\n- Number of people sharing: 3 (Mike, Rita, Anita)\n- Bars shared equally between the 3 people\n\nTo calculate the individual share, we can divide the total bars by the number of people:\n12 bars / 3 people = 4 bars per person\n\nThen to get Mike and Rita's combined share, we multiply the individual share by 2, since we are considering 2 out of the 3 people.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations and clearly show the steps.\n</thinking>",
