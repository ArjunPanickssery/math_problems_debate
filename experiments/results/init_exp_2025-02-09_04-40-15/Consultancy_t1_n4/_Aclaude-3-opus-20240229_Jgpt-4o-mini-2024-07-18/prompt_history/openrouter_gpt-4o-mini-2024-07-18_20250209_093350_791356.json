How many yellow crayons are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 32.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:5+14=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)-6=32 crayons\n#### 32\n(A): 44.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:14+5=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)+6=44 crayons\n#### 44\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe question provides the following information:\n- There are 14 red crayons\n- There are 5 more blue crayons than red crayons\n- There are 6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons\n\nTo calculate the number of yellow crayons, we first need to determine the number of blue crayons. This can be done by adding 5 to the number of red crayons.\n\nThen, we need to double the number of blue crayons and subtract 6 to get the number of yellow crayons.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The required parameters are:\n- Number of red crayons: 14 (provided)\n- Number of blue crayons: 14 + 5 = 19 (can be calculated)\n- Number of yellow crayons: 2 * 19 - 6 = 32 (can be calculated)\n\nSo the math_eval tool has all the necessary information to calculate the final answer.\n</thinking><tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"14 + 5\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"14 + 5\"},\n    \"result\": 19,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe question provides the following information:\n- There are 14 red crayons\n- There are 5 more blue crayons than red crayons\n- There are 6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons\n\nTo calculate the number of yellow crayons, we first need to determine the number of blue crayons.
