If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100\n(B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe question provides a ratio of how money was split between Sam's three cousins.

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe judge is asking for clarification on several key points:\n1. The total ratio of parts among all three cousins\n2. How the amount each cousin receives is calculated from the ratio \n3. Confirmation of the 2:1 ratio between Sandra and Amy specifically\n4. How Amy receiving $50 impacts the total amount distributed\n5. The specific method to determine Sandra's amount from Amy's\n6. If there are alternate interpretations of the ratio\n7. Other potential factors affecting the money distribution\n\nTo address these, I will confirm the total ratio sums to 6 parts, and that each cousin's amount is their share of the total based on the number of parts they have in the ratio. I'll verify the 2:1 ratio for Sandra vs Amy is correct.\n\nRegarding the $50 Amy received, I'll explain this allows us to determine the value of 1 part, which in turn lets us calculate the amounts for Sandra and Ruth. The method is to divide Amy's $50 by her 1 part to get the value per part, then multiply that by Sandra's 2 parts.\n\nI'll note that the ratio is clearly stated, so there isn't really an alternate interpretation. And no other factors are mentioned, so we can assume the ratio is the sole basis for the split.\n</thinking>\n\nThe total ratio of parts is 2+1+3 = 6. So the total is divided into 6 equal parts, and each cousin receives a number of those parts based on the ratio.\n\nThe problem states the ratio of money split between Sandra, Amy and Ruth was 2:1:3 respectively. This does indeed mean that for every 1 part Amy received, Sandra received 2 parts, a 2:1 ratio between them.\n\nAmy receiving $50 allows us to calculate the value of 1 part. Since she has 1 part and received $50, we know 1 part = $50/1 = $50. \n\nTo determine how much Sandra received, we multiply the $50 value of 1 part by Sandra's 2 parts in the ratio:",
