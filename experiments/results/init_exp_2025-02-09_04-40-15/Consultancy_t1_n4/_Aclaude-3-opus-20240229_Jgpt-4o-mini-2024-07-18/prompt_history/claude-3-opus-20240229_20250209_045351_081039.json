Company A was able to sell 300 and company B 350 big bottles of milk. How much more money did one company make from the other?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 25.0\nCompany A earned 300 * 4 = $1200 for big bottles of milk.\nCompany B earned 350 * 3.5 = $1225 for big bottles of milk.\nCompany B earned 1225 - 1200 = $25 more than company A.\n#### 25\n(A): 325.0\nCompany A sells at $4 and Company B at $3.5, a difference of $0.5 per bottle.\nTotal bottles sold were 300 + 350 = 650 bottles.\nThe difference in earnings was 0.5 * 650 = $325.\n#### 325\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 325.0\nCompany A sells at $4 and Company B at $3.5, a difference of $0.5 per bottle.\nTotal bottles sold were 300 + 350 = 650 bottles.\nThe difference in earnings was 0.5 * 650 = $325.\n#### 325"
