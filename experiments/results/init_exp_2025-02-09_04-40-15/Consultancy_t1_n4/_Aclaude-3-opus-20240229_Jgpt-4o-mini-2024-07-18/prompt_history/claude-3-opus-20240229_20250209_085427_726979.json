If each class is 3 credits, how many classes does she need to take per semester?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 5.0\n120 credits / 3 credits is 40.\n40 credits/ 8 semester = 5 classes per semester.\nMaddy needs to take 5 classes per semester\n#### 5\n(B): 15\nStarting with 120 total credits required\nDividing by 8 semesters gives us 15 credits per semester\nConverting to classes by dividing these semester credits by 3 credits per class\nThis means 15 classes per semester are needed\n#### 15\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 15\nStarting with 120 total credits required\nDividing by 8 semesters gives us 15 credits per semester\nConverting to classes by dividing these semester credits by 3 credits per class\nThis means 15 classes per semester are needed\n#### 15"
