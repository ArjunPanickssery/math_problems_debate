      "content": "QUESTION: A long wire is cut into three smaller pieces in the ratio of 7:3:2. If the shortest piece is 16 cm, how long was the entire wire before it was cut?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 96.0\nSince the shortest part is consists of 2 parts, then each part is equal to 16 cm/2 = 8 cm.\nThe whole wire was cut into 7 + 3 + 2 = 12 parts.\nHence, the wire was 8 cm x 12 = 96 cm long\n#### 96\n(B): 64\nIf we take the middle piece (ratio 3) as 16 cm, then each unit length is 16 \u00f7 3 = 5.33... cm\nFor ratio 7: 7 \u00d7 5.33... = 37.33... cm\nFor ratio 3: 16 cm\nFor ratio 2: 2 \u00d7 5.33... = 10.67... cm\nTotal length = 37.33... + 16 + 10.67... = 64 cm\n#### 64\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 96.0\nSince the shortest part is consists of 2 parts, then each part is equal to 16 cm/2 = 8 cm.\nThe whole wire was cut into 7 + 3 + 2 = 12 parts.\nHence, the wire was 8 cm x 12 = 96 cm long\n#### 96"

Figure out what 1 part length is based on the shortest piece being 2 parts\n2. Add up the total number of parts the wire was cut into\n3. Multiply the part length by the total number of parts\nNo additional tools are needed since all the required information is provided and the calculations are straightforward.\n</thinking>\n\nThe original length of the wire can be determined as follows:\n\nThe wire was cut into three pieces with a ratio of 7:3:2. We are told the shortest piece, which corresponds to 2 parts, is 16 cm long. \n\nTo find the length of 1 part, we divide the length of the shortest piece by the number of parts it represents:\n16 cm / 2 = 8 cm per part\n\nNow we need to find the total number of parts the wire was cut into. We can do this by adding up the numbers in the ratio:\n7 + 3 + 2 = 12 total parts\n\nSince we know the length of 1 part is 8 cm, and there were originally 12 parts, we can calculate the original length of the wire by multiplying:",
