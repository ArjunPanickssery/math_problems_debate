          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key steps to solve this problem are:\n1. Calculate the number of red jelly beans (3/4 of the total)\n2. Calculate 1/4 of the red jelly beans to get the number of coconut flavored ones\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The total number of jelly beans (4000) is given. To calculate 3/4 of that, the expression would be 4000 * 3/4. Then to get 1/4 of that result, the output of the first calculation could be divided by 4.\n\nSo the plan is:\n1. Use math_eval to calculate 4000 * 3/4 to get total red jelly beans \n2. Use math_eval to divide the previous result by 4 to get the coconut flavored amount\n</thinking>",
