      "content": "QUESTION: Kylie and Kayla pick apples together and take home 340 apples total. If Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked, how many apples did Kayla pick?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 274.0\nLet x be the number of apples Kylie picked\nKayla picked 10+4x apples\n340=x+(10+4x)\n340=5x+10\n330=5x\nx=66 apples\nKayla picked 10+4(66)=274 apples\n#### 274\n(B): 280\nLet x be the number of apples Kylie picked\nKayla picked 4(x+10) apples\n340=x+4(x+10)\n340=x+4x+40\n340=5x+40\n300=5x\nx=60 apples\nKayla picked 4(60+10)=4(70)=280 apples\n#### 280\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe question asks how many apples Kayla picked, given that the total number of apples picked by Kylie and Kayla is 340, and that Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the amount Kylie picked.\n\nTo solve this, we can set up an equation letting x be the number of apples Kylie picked. Then Kayla picked 4x + 10 apples.\n\nThe total apples picked is 340, so:\nx + (4x + 10) = 340\n\nThis equation can be solved for x to determine how many apples Kylie picked. Then we can calculate how many apples Kayla picked using 4x + 10.\n\nNo additional information or tools are needed to solve this problem, as all the necessary information is provided in the question. The problem can be solved with basic algebra.\n</thinking>\n\nLet x be the number of apples Kylie picked. \nThen Kayla picked 4x + 10 apples, which is 10 more than 4 times the amount Kylie picked.\n\nThe total number of apples picked by Kylie and Kayla together is 340. So we can write the equation:\n\nx + (4x + 10) = 340\n\nSimplifying:\n5x + 10 = 340\n5x = 330\nx = 66\n\nSo Kylie picked 66 apples. \n\nTo calculate how many apples Kayla picked, we plug x=66 into the expression 4x + 10:\n\n4(66) + 10 = 264 + 10 = 274\n\nTherefore, Kayla picked 274 apples, so the correct answer is (A).\n"
