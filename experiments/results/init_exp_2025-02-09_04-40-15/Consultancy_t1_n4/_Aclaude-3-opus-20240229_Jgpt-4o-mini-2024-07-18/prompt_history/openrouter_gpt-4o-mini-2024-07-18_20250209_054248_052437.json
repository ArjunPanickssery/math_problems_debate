If there are 75 total chickens, how many hens are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 67.0\nLet x represent the number of roosters\nNumber of hens:9x-5\nTotal:9x-5+x=75\n10x-5=75\n10x=80\nx=8\nNumber of hens: 9(8)-5=67\n#### 67\n(B): 68.0\nLet x represent the number of roosters\nNumber of hens: 9x+5\nTotal: 9x+5+x=75\n10x+5=75\n10x=70\nx=7\nNumber of hens: 9(7)+5=68\n#### 68\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nTo determine the number of hens, we need to set up an equation based on the given information and solve for the number of roosters first. The key pieces of information are:\n- The farm has 5 less than 9 times the amount of hens as roosters\n- There are 75 total chickens\nThe equation will involve letting a variable (like x) represent the number of roosters, and expressing the number of hens in terms of x. \nOnce we have the equation, we can solve it using basic algebra steps like combining like terms, isolating the variable, and dividing both sides to solve for x.\nAfter finding the number of roosters, we can plug that value into the expression for the number of hens to get the final answer.\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful for checking the algebraic steps, but all the necessary information to solve this is provided in the question. No additional tools are needed.\n</thinking>\n\nLet x represent the number of roosters. \nThen the number of hens is 9x - 5.\nThe total number of chickens is the number of roosters plus the number of hens:\nx + (9x - 5) = 75\nSimplifying:\n10x - 5 = 75\nAdd 5 to both sides:\n10x = 80\nDivide both sides by 10:\nx = 8\nSo there are 8 roosters. Plugging this into the expression for the number of hens:\n9(8) - 5 = 67\nTherefore, there are 67 hens.<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"9 * 8 - 5\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"9 * 8 - 5\"},\n    \"result\": 67,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nTo determine the number of hens, we need to set up an equation based on the given information and solve for the number of roosters first.

This matches the proposed answer of 67 hens.\n"
