If each rawhide bone is $1, and each dog biscuit is $0.25, then how much does it cost, in dollars, to feed Belle these treats for a week?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 21.0\nA week's worth of rawhide bones cost 1*2*7=14 dollars.\nA week's worth of dog biscuits cost 0.25*4*7=7 dollars,\nThus, in total, it cost 14+7=21 dollars\n#### 21\n(A): 31.50\nThe rawhide bones cost 4*1*7=28 dollars.\nThe dog biscuits cost 2*0.25*7=3.50 dollars.\nThus, in total, it costs 28+3.50=31.50 dollars\n#### 31.50\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nTo calculate the total cost of feeding Belle the treats for a week, we need to:\n1.
