      "content": "QUESTION: Tom needs to lower a rope down 6 stories.   One story is 10 feet.  The only rope being sold is 20 feet long but you lose 25% when lashing them together.  How many pieces of rope will he need to buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet\nHe loses 20*.25=5 feet each time\nSo he gets 20-5=15 feet from each piece\nThat means he needs 60/15=4 pieces of rope\n#### 4\n(A): 3.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet of rope total\nEach piece of rope is 20 feet\nTherefore he needs 60/20=3 pieces of rope\n#### 3\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 4.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet\nHe loses 20*.25=5 feet each time\nSo he gets 20-5=15 feet from each piece\nThat means he needs 60/15=4 pieces of rope\n#### 4"

He loses 25% of each rope's length when lashing them together\n4. So the usable length of each rope piece is 20 feet - 25% = 15 feet\n5. To get 60 feet total with 15 foot pieces, he needs 60/15 = 4 pieces\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to verify the calculations in steps 3-5.\n</thinking>",
