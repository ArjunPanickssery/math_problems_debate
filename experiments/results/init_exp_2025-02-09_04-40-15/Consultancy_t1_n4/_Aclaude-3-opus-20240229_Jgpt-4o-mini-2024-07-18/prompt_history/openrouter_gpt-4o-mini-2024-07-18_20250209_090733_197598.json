How many cows are not black?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 4.0\nHalf of the cows: 18/2=9\nBlack cows: 5+9=14\n18-14=4 cows\n#### 4\n(B): 6\nTotal cows plus 5: 18+5 = 23\nHalf of 23 (rounded): 12\nThese are black cows\nNon-black cows: 18-12 = 6\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe question asks how many of Sam's 18 cows are not black, given that 5 more than half the cows are black. To determine this, we need to calculate:\n1. How many cows are half of Sam's total cows\n2. Add 5 to that number to get the number of black cows \n3. Subtract the number of black cows from the total cows to get the number of non-black cows\n\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful in performing these calculations.
