To determine Shane's current age, we need to:\n1. Calculate how old Shane was 20 years ago by doubling Garret's current age\n2. Add 20 years to Shane's age from 20 years ago to get his current age\nNo tools are needed, as the necessary information is provided in the question and the calculations are straightforward.\n</thinking>\n\nThe key facts are:\n- 20 years ago, Shane was 2 times older than Garret is now\n- Garret is currently 12 years old\n\nTo calculate Shane's age 20 years ago:",
