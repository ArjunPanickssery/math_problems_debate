      "content": "QUESTION: Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, while her sister has two more dolls than their grandmother. If their grandmother has 50 dolls, how many dolls do they have altogether?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 258.0\nIf the grandmother has 50 dolls, Rene's sister, who has 2 more dolls than their grandmother, has 50+2 = 52 dolls.\nTogether, Rene's sister and the grandmother have 52+50 = 102 dolls.\nSince Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, she has 52*3 = 156 dolls.\nAltogether, they have 156+102 = 258 dolls.\n#### 258\n(B): 658.0\nStarting with grandmother's 50 dolls, we first multiply by 3 to get 150.\nAdding 2 gives us the sister's number of dolls: 152.\nSince Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, she has 152*3 = 456 dolls.\nThe total number of dolls is therefore 50+152+456 = 658.\n#### 658\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 258.0\nIf the grandmother has 50 dolls, Rene's sister, who has 2 more dolls than their grandmother, has 50+2 = 52 dolls.\nTogether, Rene's sister and the grandmother have 52+50 = 102 dolls.\nSince Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, she has 52*3 = 156 dolls.\nAltogether, they have 156+102 = 258 dolls.\n#### 258"

      "content": "<thinking>\nThe key steps to solve this problem are:\n1. Find how many dolls Rene's sister has, given that she has 2 more than the grandmother's 50 dolls. This can be calculated as 50 + 2 = 52 dolls.\n2. Calculate how many dolls Rene has, given that she has 3 times as many as her sister. Since her sister has 52 dolls, Rene has 52 * 3 = 156 dolls. \n3. Sum up the total number of dolls between the grandmother, Rene's sister, and Rene. This is 50 + 52 + 156.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform the addition and multiplication calculations in steps 1-3 to arrive at the final total. The problem statement provides all the necessary information, so no additional tools or information are needed.\n</thinking>",
