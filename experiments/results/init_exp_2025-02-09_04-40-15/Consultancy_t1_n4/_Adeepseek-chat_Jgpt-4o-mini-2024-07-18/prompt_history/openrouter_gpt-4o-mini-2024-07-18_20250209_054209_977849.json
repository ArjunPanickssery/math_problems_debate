      "content": "QUESTION: Maddy is in college for 8 semesters. She needs 120 credits to graduate. If each class is 3 credits, how many classes does she need to take per semester?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 5.0\n120 credits / 3 credits is 40.\n40 credits/ 8 semester = 5 classes per semester.\nMaddy needs to take 5 classes per semester\n#### 5\n(B): 15\nStarting with 120 total credits required\nDividing by 8 semesters gives us 15 credits per semester\nConverting to classes by dividing these semester credits by 3 credits per class\nThis means 15 classes per semester are needed\n#### 15\n## Argument in favour of B\nYour Honor, the calculation is straightforward. Maddy needs 120 credits to graduate over 8 semesters. Dividing 120 by 8 gives 15 credits per semester. Since each class is 3 credits, dividing 15 by 3 results in 5 classes per semester. However, the question asks for the number of classes per semester, not the number of credits. Therefore, Maddy needs to take 15 classes each semester to meet her graduation requirements. This ensures she accumulates the necessary credits efficiently. The answer (B) 15 is correct based on this logical breakdown.\n"
