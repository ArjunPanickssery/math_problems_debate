      "content": "QUESTION: A farmer gets 20 pounds of bacon on average from a pig. He sells each pound for $6 at the monthly farmer\u2019s market. This month\u2019s pig is a runt that grew to only half the size of the average pig. How many dollars will the farmer make from the pig\u2019s bacon?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nThe pig grew to half the size of the average pig, so it will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nThe rancher will make 10 * 6 = $60 from the pig\u2019s bacon.\n#### 60\n(A): 30.0\nThe pig will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nEach pound will sell for 6 / 2 = $3.\nThe farmer will make 10 * 3 = $30 from the pig's bacon.\n#### 30\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe answer is $60 because the price per pound of bacon remains unchanged at $6, regardless of the pig's size. The runt produces half the bacon of an average pig, so 20 / 2 = 10 pounds. Multiplying 10 pounds by $6 per pound yields $60. There is no indication in the problem that the price per pound is reduced due to the pig\u2019s size, so the farmer earns $60 from this pig\u2019s bacon.\n"
