First, calculate the total number of red jelly beans: \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 4000 = 3000 \\). Next, since one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, we compute \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 3000 = 750 \\). This step-by-step approach ensures accuracy by first isolating the red jelly beans and then identifying the subset that is coconut flavored. Thus, the correct number of coconut-flavored jelly beans is 750.",
