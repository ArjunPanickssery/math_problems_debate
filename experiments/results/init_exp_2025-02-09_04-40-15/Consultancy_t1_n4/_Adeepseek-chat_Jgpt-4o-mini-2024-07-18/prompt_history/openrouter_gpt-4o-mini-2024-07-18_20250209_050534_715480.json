      "content": "QUESTION: John has to restring 3 basses with 4 strings each, twice as many guitars which have 6 strings each, and 3 fewer 8 string guitars than the normal guitars.  How many strings does he need?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 72.0\nThe basses take 3*4=12 strings\nHe restrings 2*3=6 normal guitars\nThat takes 6*6=36 strings\nHe restrings 6-3=3 guitars with 8 strings\nSo that uses 3*8=24 strings\nSo he uses 12+36+24=72 strings\n#### 72\n(B): 96.0\nThe basses take 3*4=12 strings\nHe restrings 2*3=6 normal guitars\nThat takes 6*6=36 strings\nFor 8-string guitars, we need 6 guitars\nSo that uses 6*8=48 strings\nSo he uses 12+36+48=96 strings\n#### 96\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, the calculation in answer (A) is correct because it accurately follows the problem's instructions. John restrings 3 basses with 4 strings each, totaling 12 strings. He then restrings twice as many normal guitars as basses, which is 6 guitars with 6 strings each, totaling 36 strings. Finally, he restrings 3 fewer 8-string guitars than normal guitars, which is 3 guitars with 8 strings each, totaling 24 strings. Adding these together, 12 + 36 + 24, gives 72 strings. The logic is clear and consistent with the problem's details.\n"
