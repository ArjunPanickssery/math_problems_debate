      "content": "QUESTION: Isaac cut his 30 meters ribbon into 6 equal parts. He then used 4 parts of the ribbon. How many meters of ribbon are not used?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 10.0\nEach part is 30/6 = 5 meters long.\nSince Liam used 4 parts, then he used 5 x 4 = 20 meters of the ribbon.\nSo, 30 - 20 = 10 meters of ribbon is not used.\n#### 10\n(B): 15.0\nThe ribbon was cut into 6 parts, and 4 were used, leaving 2 parts unused.\nEach part is 30/4 = 7.5 meters long.\nTherefore 2 \u00d7 7.5 = 15 meters were not used.\n#### 15\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (A): 10.0 meters. The ribbon was divided into 6 equal parts, so each part is 30 meters divided by 6, which equals 5 meters. Isaac used 4 parts, so he used 4 \u00d7 5 = 20 meters. Subtracting the used portion from the total, 30 - 20 = 10 meters remain unused. This calculation is straightforward and aligns with the problem's conditions. Answer (B) incorrectly divides the ribbon into 4 parts, which contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, (A) is the accurate and logical choice.\n"
