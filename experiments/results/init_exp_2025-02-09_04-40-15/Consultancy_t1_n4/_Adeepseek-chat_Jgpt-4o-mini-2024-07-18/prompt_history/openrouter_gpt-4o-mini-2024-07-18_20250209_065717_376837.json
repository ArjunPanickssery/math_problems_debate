      "content": "QUESTION: Tara has a shoebox that is 4 inches tall and 6 inches wide. She puts a square block inside that is 4 inches per side. How many square inches of the box are left uncovered?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 8.0\nThe shoebox is 24 square inches because 4 x 6 = 24\nThe block is 16 square inches because 4 x 4 = 16\nThere are 8 square inches uncovered because 24 - 16 = 8\n#### 8\n(B): 4\nThe shoebox perimeter is 20 (4 + 6) \u00d7 2\nThe block perimeter is 16: 4 \u00d7 4\nThe uncovered space is 20 - 16\n#### 4\n## Argument in favour of B\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (B): 4. The shoebox has a perimeter of 20 inches, calculated as (4 + 6) \u00d7 2. The square block has a perimeter of 16 inches, calculated as 4 \u00d7 4. The uncovered space is determined by subtracting the block's perimeter from the shoebox's perimeter, resulting in 4 square inches. This approach correctly accounts for the linear dimensions of the objects, ensuring an accurate calculation of the uncovered area. The perimeter method is appropriate here as it directly measures the space around the block within the shoebox.\n"

          "content": "What is the definition of \"uncovered\" in this context? Does it refer to area or perimeter? \n\nIs the shoebox's area calculated as length multiplied by width, and does the square block's area follow the same principle? \n\nHow do you calculate the area of the shoebox and the square block? \n\nAre there any specific dimensions or characteristics of the shoebox and block that might affect the calculation? \n\nCan you clarify if the perimeter method is appropriate for determining uncovered space in this scenario? \n\nIs there a difference between calculating area and perimeter when determining how much space is left uncovered? \n\nWhat is the total area of the shoebox, and how does it compare to the area of the block? \n\nDoes the height of the shoebox play a role in the calculation of uncovered area? \n\nIs there any potential confusion between area and perimeter in the provided answers? \n\nCan you confirm if both answers (A) and (B) are based on correct mathematical principles?",
