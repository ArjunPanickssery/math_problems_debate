      "content": "QUESTION: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 828.0\nA single watermelon would sell for $2 x 23 = $46\n60 watermelons would sell for $46 x 18 = $828\n#### 828\n(B): 1656\nSince these are $2 per pound watermelons, first calculate the base price:\n$2 x 23 = $46 per watermelon\nFor 18 watermelons: $46 x 18 = $828\nFinally, account for the per-pound pricing: $828 x 2 = $1656\n#### 1656\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo determine the correct answer, let's break it down step by step. Each watermelon weighs 23 pounds and is sold at $2 per pound. Therefore, the price for one watermelon is $2 x 23 = $46. When selling 18 watermelons, the total revenue would be $46 x 18 = $828. There is no need to multiply by 2 again, as the per-pound pricing is already accounted for in the initial calculation. Thus, the correct amount Farmer Kent would make is $828.\n"
