      "content": "QUESTION: Tom needs to lower a rope down 6 stories.   One story is 10 feet.  The only rope being sold is 20 feet long but you lose 25% when lashing them together.  How many pieces of rope will he need to buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet\nHe loses 20*.25=5 feet each time\nSo he gets 20-5=15 feet from each piece\nThat means he needs 60/15=4 pieces of rope\n#### 4\n(A): 3.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet of rope total\nEach piece of rope is 20 feet\nTherefore he needs 60/20=3 pieces of rope\n#### 3\n## Argument in favour of B\nTom needs a total of 60 feet of rope to lower it down 6 stories. Each rope is 20 feet long, but when lashed together, he loses 25% of its length, which is 5 feet per rope. This means each piece effectively provides only 15 feet of usable length. To cover the 60 feet required, he needs 60 divided by 15, which equals 4 pieces of rope. This calculation accounts for the loss during lashing, ensuring he has enough rope to reach the desired height. Therefore, Tom must buy 4 pieces of rope.\n"
