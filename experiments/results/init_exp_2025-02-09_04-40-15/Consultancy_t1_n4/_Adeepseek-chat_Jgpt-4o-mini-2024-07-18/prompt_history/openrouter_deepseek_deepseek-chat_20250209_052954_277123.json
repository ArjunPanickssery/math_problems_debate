      "content": "QUESTION: Sam shared a sum of money between his three cousins Sandra, Amy and Ruth in the ratio 2:1:3 respectively. If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100\n(B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe ratio 2:1:3 indicates that Sandra receives 2 parts, Amy 1 part, and Ruth 3 parts. Since Amy received $50, which corresponds to 1 part, Sandra\u2019s share, being 2 parts, should logically be calculated by dividing Amy\u2019s amount by 2. This ensures proportionality within the ratio. Therefore, Sandra\u2019s share is $50 / 2 = $25. This approach maintains the integrity of the ratio and ensures that each cousin\u2019s share is correctly adjusted based on their respective parts. Thus, Sandra received $25.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total number of parts in the ratio 2:1:3?  \nHow do you calculate the amount each cousin receives based on the total amount and their respective parts?  \nCan you explain how the ratio translates into actual dollar amounts for each cousin?  \nIf Amy received $50, how does that relate to the total amount shared among all three cousins?  \nWhat is the relationship between the parts of the ratio and the actual amounts received by each cousin?  \nIs there a specific method to determine Sandra's amount based on Amy's amount in this ratio?  \nCan you clarify if the amounts received by each cousin are directly proportional to the parts in the ratio?  \nHow would you verify the calculations for each cousin's share based on the given ratio?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25"

          "content": "The ratio 2:1:3 totals 6 parts. Since Amy received $50, which is 1 part, the total amount shared is $50 * 6 = $300. Sandra\u2019s 2 parts would then be $300 * (2/6) = $100. However, the question asks for Sandra\u2019s amount based on Amy\u2019s $50. Since Sandra has twice Amy\u2019s parts, her share is $50 * 2 = $100. The initial argument for $25 was incorrect because it misapplied the ratio. The correct calculation shows Sandra received $100, maintaining the 2:1:3 proportionality. Thus, Sandra\u2019s share is $100.",
