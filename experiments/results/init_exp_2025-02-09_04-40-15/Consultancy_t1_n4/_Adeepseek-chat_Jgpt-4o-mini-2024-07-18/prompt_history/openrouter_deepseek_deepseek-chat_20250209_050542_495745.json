          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (A): 8.0. The shoebox has an area of 24 square inches, calculated by multiplying its height (4 inches) by its width (6 inches). The square block inside the box has an area of 16 square inches, determined by squaring its side length (4 inches). To find the uncovered area, we subtract the block's area from the box's area: 24 - 16 = 8. This straightforward calculation clearly shows that 8 square inches of the box remain uncovered. The perimeter-based approach in (B) is irrelevant here, as the question specifically asks for uncovered area, not perimeter.",
