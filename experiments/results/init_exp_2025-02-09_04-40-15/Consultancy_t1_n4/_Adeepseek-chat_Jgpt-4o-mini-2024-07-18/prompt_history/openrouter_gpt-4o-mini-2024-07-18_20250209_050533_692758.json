      "content": "QUESTION: Carl buys index cards for his class.  He gives each student 10 index cards.  He teaches 6 periods a day and each class has 30 students.  If a 50 pack of index cards cost $3 how much did he spend on them all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 108.0\nHe has 30*6=180 students\nSo he needs to buy 180*10=1800 index cards\nThat means he needs to buy 1800/50=36 packs of index cards\nSo he spends 36*3=$108\n#### 108\n(B): 1800\nHe has 30*6=180 students\nSo he needs 180*10=1800 cards\nThat means he needs to buy 1800/3=600 packs\nSo he spends 600*3=$1800\n#### 1800\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (A) $108. Here\u2019s why: Carl teaches 6 periods with 30 students each, totaling 180 students. Each student receives 10 index cards, so he needs 1,800 cards. Since index cards come in packs of 50, he needs 36 packs (1,800 \u00f7 50). At $3 per pack, the total cost is $108. The calculation in (B) incorrectly divides the number of cards by the cost per pack instead of the number of cards per pack, leading to an inflated total. Thus, (A) is the accurate and logical answer.\n"
