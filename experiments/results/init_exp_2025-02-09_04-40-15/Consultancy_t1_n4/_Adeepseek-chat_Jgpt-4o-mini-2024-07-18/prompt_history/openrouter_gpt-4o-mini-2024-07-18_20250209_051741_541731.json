      "content": "QUESTION: Sam shared a sum of money between his three cousins Sandra, Amy and Ruth in the ratio 2:1:3 respectively. If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100\n(B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe ratio 2:1:3 indicates that Sandra receives 2 parts, Amy 1 part, and Ruth 3 parts. Since Amy received $50, which corresponds to 1 part, Sandra\u2019s share, being 2 parts, should logically be calculated by dividing Amy\u2019s amount by 2. This ensures proportionality within the ratio. Therefore, Sandra\u2019s share is $50 / 2 = $25. This approach maintains the integrity of the ratio and ensures that each cousin\u2019s share is correctly adjusted based on their respective parts. Thus, Sandra received $25.\n"
