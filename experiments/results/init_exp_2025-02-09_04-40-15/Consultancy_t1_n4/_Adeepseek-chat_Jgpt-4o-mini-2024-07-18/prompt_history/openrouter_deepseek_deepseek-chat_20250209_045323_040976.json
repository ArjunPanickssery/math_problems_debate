          "content": "Your Honor, the correct percentage off Asia received is 150%. The calculation is straightforward: the difference between the original price ($350) and the sale price ($140) is $210. To find the percentage off, we divide the savings ($210) by the sale price ($140), which gives us 1.5 or 150%. This means Asia effectively received a 150% discount on the original price, making the sale price significantly lower than the original. This method accurately reflects the substantial savings Asia enjoyed.",
