      "content": "QUESTION: My dog was born when I was 15 years old. Two years from now, my dog will turn 4 years old. How old am I now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 17.0\nIn 2 years, my dog will be 4 years old, so my dog is 4 - 2 = 2 years old now.\nSo I am 15 + 2 = 17 years old now.\n#### 17\n(B): 19.0\nI was 15 when my dog was born. My dog will be 4 years old in 2 years.\nSo my current age is 15 + 4 = 19 years old.\n#### 19\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour dog will be 4 years old in 2 years, meaning it is currently 2 years old. Since your dog was born when you were 15, your current age must be 15 plus the dog's current age of 2, which equals 17. This straightforward calculation aligns with the information provided and logically concludes that you are now 17 years old.\n"
