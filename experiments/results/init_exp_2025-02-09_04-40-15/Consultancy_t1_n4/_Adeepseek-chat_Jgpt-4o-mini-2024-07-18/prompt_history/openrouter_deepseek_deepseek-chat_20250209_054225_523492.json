      "content": "QUESTION: A box of chocolate bars was shared equally between Mike, Rita and Anita. If the box contains 12 bars, how many bars did Mike and Rita get (combined)?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 8.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nMike and Rita together got 4+4 = 8 bars\n#### 8\n(A): 4.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nSince Mike and Rita shared the bars, they got 4 bars together\n#### 4\n## Argument in favour of B\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (B) 8.0. The box contains 12 bars, and they are shared equally among Mike, Rita, and Anita. This means each person receives 12 divided by 3, which is 4 bars. When we consider Mike and Rita together, we simply add their individual shares: 4 bars for Mike plus 4 bars for Rita equals 8 bars. This calculation is straightforward and aligns with the principle of equal distribution. Therefore, Mike and Rita combined received 8 bars.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total number of chocolate bars in the box?  \nHow many people are sharing the chocolate bars?  \nHow many bars does each person receive when the total is divided equally?  \nIf Mike and Rita each receive the same amount, what is their combined total?  \nIs it possible for Mike and Rita to receive a different total than what was calculated?  \nCan you confirm that the sharing process was done equally among all three individuals?  \nAre there any additional factors that might affect the distribution of the chocolate bars?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 8.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nMike and Rita together got 4+4 = 8 bars\n#### 8"

Since Mike and Rita each receive 4 bars, their combined total is **8 bars**. The sharing process was explicitly stated to be equal, ensuring no discrepancies. No additional factors affect the distribution, as the problem clearly specifies equal sharing. Therefore, Mike and Rita\u2019s combined total is **8 bars**, and any other interpretation would contradict the principle of equal division. The answer (B) 8.0 is unequivocally correct.",
