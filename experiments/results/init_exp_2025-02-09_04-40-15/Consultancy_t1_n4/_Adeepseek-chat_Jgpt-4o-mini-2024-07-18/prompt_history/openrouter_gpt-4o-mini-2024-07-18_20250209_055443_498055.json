      "content": "QUESTION: There are 120 crayons in a box.  One third of the crayons are new, 20% are broken, and the rest are slightly used.  How many are slightly used?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 56.0\nNew:120/3=40 crayons\nBroken:120(.20)=24 crayons\nSlightly Used:120-40-24=56 crayons\n#### 56\n(A): 64.0\nNew:120/3=40 crayons\nRemaining:120-40=80 crayons\nBroken:80(.20)=16 crayons\nSlightly Used:80-16=64 crayons\n#### 64\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is (B): 56.0. Here's why: The problem states that 20% of the total crayons are broken, not 20% of the remaining crayons after removing the new ones. Therefore, we calculate 20% of 120, which is 24 broken crayons. Subtracting both the new (40) and broken (24) crayons from the total (120) leaves us with 56 slightly used crayons. This approach directly follows the problem's wording and ensures accurate calculations.\n"
