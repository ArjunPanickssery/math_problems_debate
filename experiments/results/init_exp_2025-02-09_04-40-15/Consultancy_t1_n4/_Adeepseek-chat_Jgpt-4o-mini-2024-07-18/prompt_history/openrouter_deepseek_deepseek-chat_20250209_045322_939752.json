          "content": "Maria\u2019s ticket originally cost $15. A 40% discount means she saved 40% of $15, which is $6. To find the final price, subtract the discount from the original price: $15 - $6 = $9. This calculation clearly shows that Maria paid $9 for her ticket. The logic is straightforward: discounts reduce the original price, not replace it entirely. Therefore, the correct answer is (A): 9.0. This aligns with standard pricing practices and ensures the math is accurate.",
