      "content": "QUESTION: Oli's banana split has 4 scoops of ice cream while Victoria has twice more scoops of ice cream than Oli's. How many more scoops of ice cream does Victoria have than Oli?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nVictoria has 4 x 2 = 8 scoops of ice cream.\nTherefore, Victoria has 8 - 4 = 4 more scoops of ice cream than Oli.\n#### 4\n(A): 8.0\nVictoria's scoops can be calculated as 4 + (2 \u00d7 4) = 4 + 8 = 12 scoops of ice cream.\nTherefore, Victoria has 12 - 4 = 8 more scoops than Oli.\n#### 8\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe phrase \"twice more scoops\" implies an addition to the original amount, not just a multiplication. Oli has 4 scoops, so \"twice more\" means Victoria has 4 plus twice 4, which is 12 scoops. Subtracting Oli's 4 scoops from Victoria's 12 gives 8 more scoops. This interpretation aligns with the natural reading of \"twice more\" as an additive increase. Thus, Victoria has 8 more scoops than Oli.\n"
