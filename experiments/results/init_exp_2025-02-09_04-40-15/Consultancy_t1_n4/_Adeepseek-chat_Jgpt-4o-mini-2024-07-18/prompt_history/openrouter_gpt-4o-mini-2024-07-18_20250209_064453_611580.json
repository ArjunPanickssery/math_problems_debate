      "content": "QUESTION: In the engineering department, 70% of the students are men and 180 are women. How many men are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 420.0\nThe percentage for women is 100% - 70% = 30%.\nSince 180 represents 30%, then 180/30 = 6 students represent 1%.\nHence, 6 x 70 = 420 students are men.\n#### 420\n(B): 126\nSince 70% of students are men, we can find the number by taking 70% of 180:\n180 \u00d7 0.7 = 126 men in the department.\n#### 126\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (A): 420.0. Here\u2019s why: The problem states that 70% of the students are men, meaning 30% are women. Since 180 women represent 30%, we can calculate that 1% corresponds to 6 students (180 \u00f7 30 = 6). Therefore, 70% of the students, which are men, must be 6 \u00d7 70 = 420. This method ensures the total number of students is consistent and aligns with the given percentages. Answer (B) incorrectly applies the 70% directly to the number of women, which is a misinterpretation of the problem.\n"
