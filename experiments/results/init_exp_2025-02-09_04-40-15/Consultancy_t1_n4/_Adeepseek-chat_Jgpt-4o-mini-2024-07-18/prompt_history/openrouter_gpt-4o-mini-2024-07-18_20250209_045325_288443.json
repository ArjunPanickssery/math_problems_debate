      "content": "QUESTION: Mary has 26 blue shirts and 36 brown shirts. If she gives away half of her blue shirts and a third of her brown shirts, how many shirts does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 37.0\nMary gives away 26/2 = 13 blue shirts.\nMary gives away 36/3 = 12 brown shirts.\nMary has 26-13 = 13 blue shirts left.\nMary has 36-12 = 24 brown shirts left.\nMary has 13+24 = 37 shirts left.\n#### 37\n(A): 35.0\nMary gives away 36/2 = 18 brown shirts.\nMary gives away 26/3 \u2248 9 blue shirts.\nMary has 26-9 = 17 blue shirts left.\nMary has 36-18 = 18 brown shirts left.\nMary has 17+18 = 35 shirts left.\n#### 35\n## Argument in favour of B\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (B): 37.0. Mary starts with 26 blue shirts and gives away half, which is 13, leaving her with 13 blue shirts. She also has 36 brown shirts and gives away a third, which is 12, leaving her with 24 brown shirts. Adding the remaining shirts together, 13 blue plus 24 brown equals 37 shirts. This calculation is straightforward and follows the instructions precisely. The other answer, (A): 35.0, incorrectly divides the shirts, leading to an incorrect total. Therefore, the accurate and logical answer is 37.0.\n"
