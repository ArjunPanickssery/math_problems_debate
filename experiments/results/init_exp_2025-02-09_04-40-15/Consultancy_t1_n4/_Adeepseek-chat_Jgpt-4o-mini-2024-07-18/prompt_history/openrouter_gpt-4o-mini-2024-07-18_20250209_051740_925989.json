      "content": "QUESTION: Wyatt has 10 blue envelopes. He has 4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue envelopes. How many envelopes does Wyatt have in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 16.0\nWyatt has 10 - 4 = 6 yellow envelopes.\nThe total number of envelopes he has is 10 blue + 6 yellow = 16 envelopes.\n#### 16\n(A): 24.0\nThe number of yellow envelopes is 10 + 4 = 14 yellow envelopes.\nThe total number of envelopes is 10 blue + 14 yellow = 24 envelopes.\n#### 24\n## Argument in favour of B\nYour Honor, the correct total number of envelopes Wyatt has is 16. Wyatt has 10 blue envelopes and 4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue envelopes. This means he has 10 - 4 = 6 yellow envelopes. Adding the blue and yellow envelopes together, 10 + 6, gives us a total of 16 envelopes. The calculation is straightforward and aligns with the information provided. Therefore, the correct answer is 16.\n"
