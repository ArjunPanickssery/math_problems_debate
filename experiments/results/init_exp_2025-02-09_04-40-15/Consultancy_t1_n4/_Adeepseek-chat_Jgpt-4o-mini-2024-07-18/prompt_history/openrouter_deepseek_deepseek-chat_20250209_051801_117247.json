In April, she saves $40 x 2 = $80. Finally, in May, she saves $80 x 2 = $160. This pattern clearly shows that her savings double each month, leading to $160 in May. The calculation is straightforward and consistent with the given condition of doubling the savings each month. Therefore, the correct answer is $160.",
