          "content": "To determine how long it takes Celia to run 30 miles, we first establish her speed relative to Lexie. Since Celia runs twice as fast as Lexie, and Lexie takes 20 minutes to run a mile, Celia takes half that time, which is 10 minutes per mile. Multiplying this by 30 miles gives us 300 minutes. This calculation is straightforward and aligns with the principle that speed inversely affects time. Therefore, Celia will take 300 minutes to run 30 miles.",
