      "content": "QUESTION: Isabel has some money in her piggy bank. She spent half the amount and bought a toy. She then spent half of the remaining money and bought her brother a book. If she has $51 left, how much money, in dollars, did she have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 204.0\nAfter buying the toy, Isabel has 51*2=102 dollars left.\nIsabel had 102*2=204 dollars at first.\n#### 204\n(A): 408.0\nWorking backwards from what's left:\n51 * 2 = 102 is the previous amount\n102 * 2 = 204 is the amount before that\n204 * 2 = 408 was the initial amount\n#### 408\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo determine Isabel's initial amount, let's work backwards step by step. After buying the book, she has $51 left, which is half of the previous amount. So, before buying the book, she had $51 * 2 = $102. This $102 is half of the amount she had after buying the toy. Therefore, before buying the toy, she had $102 * 2 = $204. Since $204 is half of her initial amount, she must have started with $204 * 2 = $408. This logical progression confirms that Isabel initially had $408 in her piggy bank.\n"
