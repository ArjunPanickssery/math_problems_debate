          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (A): 1000.0. The question specifies that one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored. However, it\u2019s crucial to note that the total number of red jelly beans is three fourths of 4000, which is 3000. One quarter of 3000 is indeed 750, but the question implies that the coconut flavored jelly beans are a subset of the red ones. Therefore, the calculation should be 3000/4 = 750. The answer (A) incorrectly assumes that one quarter of all jelly beans are coconut flavored, which is not supported by the question\u2019s wording. Thus, (B) is correct.",
