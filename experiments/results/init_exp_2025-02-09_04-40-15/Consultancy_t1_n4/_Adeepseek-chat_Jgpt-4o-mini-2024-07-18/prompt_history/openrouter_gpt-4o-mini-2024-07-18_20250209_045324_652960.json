      "content": "QUESTION: A cat has nine lives.  A dog has 3 less lives than a cat.  A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog.  How many lives does a mouse have?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 13.0\nDog:9-3=6 lives\nMouse:6+7=13 lives\n#### 13\n(A): 19.0\nCat has 9 lives\nDog has 3 more than cat: 9 + 3 = 12 lives\nMouse has 7 more than dog: 12 + 7 = 19 lives\n#### 19\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is (B): 13.0. The problem states that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat, which means 9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6 lives for the dog. Then, the mouse has 7 more lives than the dog, so 6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13 lives for the mouse. This straightforward calculation aligns with the information provided and leads to the correct answer of 13 lives for the mouse.\n"
