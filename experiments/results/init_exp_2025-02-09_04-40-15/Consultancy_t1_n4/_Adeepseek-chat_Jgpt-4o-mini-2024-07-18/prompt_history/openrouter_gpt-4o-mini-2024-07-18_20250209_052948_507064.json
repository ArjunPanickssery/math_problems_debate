      "content": "QUESTION: Isabella has three times as many green houses as yellow houses. She also has 40 fewer yellow houses than red houses. If she has 90 green houses, how many of her houses are not yellow?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 160.0\nIf the number of green houses is three times the number of yellow houses, and there are 90 green houses, then there are 90/3 = 30 yellow houses.\nShe also has 40 fewer yellow houses than blue houses, meaning there are 30+40 = 70 blue houses.\nThe number of houses that are not yellow is 70 blue houses +90 green houses = 160\n#### 160\n(A): 200.0\nIf green houses are three times yellow houses, and there are 90 green houses, then there are 90/3 = 30 yellow houses.\nYellow houses are 40 fewer than red houses, so there are 70 red houses.\nTo find all non-yellow houses, we add green houses (90) and red houses (70).\nThen we need to add the difference of 40 between red and yellow to get all non-yellow houses: 90 + 70 + 40 = 200\n#### 200\n## Argument in favour of B\nYour Honor, the correct answer is **(B): 160.0**. Isabella has 90 green houses, which is three times the number of yellow houses, so there are 30 yellow houses. Additionally, she has 40 fewer yellow houses than blue houses, meaning there are 70 blue houses. To find the number of houses that are not yellow, we add the green houses (90) and blue houses (70), totaling 160. The argument for 200 incorrectly includes an extra 40, which is already accounted for in the calculation of blue houses. Thus, 160 is the accurate answer.\n"
