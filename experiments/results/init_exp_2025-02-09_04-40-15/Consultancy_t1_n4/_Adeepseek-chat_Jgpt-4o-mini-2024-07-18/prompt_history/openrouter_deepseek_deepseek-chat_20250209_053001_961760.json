      "content": "QUESTION: There are 4,000 jelly beans in a jar. If three fourths of the jelly beans are red, and one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, how many jelly beans are coconut flavored?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 750.0\nThere are 4000/4*3=3000 red jelly beans.\nThere are 3000/4=750 coconut flavored jelly beans.\n#### 750\n(A): 1000.0\nFirst find one quarter of all jelly beans: 4000/4 = 1000\nSince these coconut ones must be among the red ones, and three fourths are red, \nthe coconut flavored ones are: 1000\n#### 1000\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo determine the number of coconut-flavored jelly beans, we must follow the problem's logical sequence. First, calculate the total number of red jelly beans: \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 4000 = 3000 \\). Next, since one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, we compute \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 3000 = 750 \\). This step-by-step approach ensures accuracy by first isolating the red jelly beans and then identifying the subset that is coconut flavored. Thus, the correct number of coconut-flavored jelly beans is 750.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many total jelly beans are there in the jar?  \nWhat fraction of the jelly beans are red?  \nWhat fraction of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored?  \nCan you confirm the calculations for the number of red jelly beans?  \nCan you confirm the calculations for the number of coconut flavored jelly beans?  \nIs there any possibility that the coconut flavored jelly beans are not included in the red jelly beans?  \nAre there any additional flavors of jelly beans mentioned in the problem?  \nIs the method of calculating the total number of coconut flavored jelly beans based on the total number of jelly beans or just the red ones?  \nWhat is the reasoning behind the answer choices provided?  \nCan you clarify if there are any assumptions made in the problem that could affect the answer?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 750.0\nThere are 4000/4*3=3000 red jelly beans.\nThere are 3000/4=750 coconut flavored jelly beans.\n#### 750"
