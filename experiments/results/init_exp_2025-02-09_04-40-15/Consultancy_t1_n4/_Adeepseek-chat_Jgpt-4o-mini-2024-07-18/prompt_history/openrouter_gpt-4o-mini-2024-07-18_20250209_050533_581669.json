      "content": "QUESTION: 4.5 gallons of coffee were divided among 18 thermoses. Genevieve drank 3 thermoses. How many pints of coffee did Genevieve drink?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 6.0\n4.5 gallons = 4.5 * 8 pints = 36 pints\n36/18 = 2 pints\nGenevieve drank 2*3=6 pints of coffee.\n#### 6\n(A): 3.0\n4.5 gallons = 4.5 * 4 pints = 18 pints\n18/18 = 1 pint per thermos\nGenevieve drank 1*3 = 3 pints of coffee.\n#### 3\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo determine how many pints Genevieve drank, we must first convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so 4.5 gallons equal 36 pints. Dividing 36 pints among 18 thermoses means each thermos contains 2 pints. Since Genevieve drank 3 thermoses, she consumed 2 pints per thermos multiplied by 3 thermoses, totaling 6 pints. This calculation is straightforward and aligns with standard unit conversions. Therefore, the correct answer is 6.0 pints.\n"
