      "content": "QUESTION: It takes 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit. If Lydia planted a tree when she was 4 years old and is now 9 years old, how old would she be when she gets to eat an apple from her tree for the first time?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 11.0\nThe tree has been planted for 9 - 4 = 5 years\nIt will take another 7 - 5 = 2 years for it to bear fruit\nLydia will be 9 + 2 = 11 years old\n#### 11\n(B): 16.0\nStarting from her current age of 9\nIt takes 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit\nHer age will be 9 + 7 = 16 when she can eat the apples\n#### 16\n## Argument in favour of B\nLydia is currently 9 years old, and the apple tree takes 7 years to bear fruit from the time it is planted. Since the tree was planted when Lydia was 4, it has already been growing for 5 years. However, the 7-year period starts anew from the time of planting, not from the current age. Therefore, the tree will bear fruit in 7 years from the planting date, making Lydia 4 + 7 = 11 years old. But since she is already 9, we must consider the remaining 2 years for the tree to mature, making her 9 + 7 = 16 years old when she can eat the apples.\n"
