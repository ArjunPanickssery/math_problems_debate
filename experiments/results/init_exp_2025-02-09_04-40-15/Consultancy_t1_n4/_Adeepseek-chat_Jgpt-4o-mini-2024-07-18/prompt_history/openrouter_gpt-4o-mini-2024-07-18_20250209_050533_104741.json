      "content": "QUESTION: Steve decides to read a new book.  He reads 100 pages Monday, Wed, and Friday.  The book is 2100 pages long.  How many weeks does it take to read them all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 7.0\nHe reads 100*3=300 pages a week\nSo it would take 2100/300=7 weeks to read the book\n#### 7\n(A): 3.0\nFirst calculate pages per day: 100 pages\nTotal segments needed: 2100/100 = 21\nDivide by days in a week: 21/7 = 3 weeks\n#### 3\n## Argument in favour of B\nSteve reads 100 pages on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, totaling 300 pages per week. To determine how many weeks it takes to read the entire 2100-page book, we divide the total pages by the weekly reading rate: 2100 / 300 = 7 weeks. This calculation is straightforward and accounts for Steve's consistent reading schedule. The alternative answer (A) incorrectly assumes Steve reads every day, but he only reads on three specific days. Therefore, the correct answer is (B): 7 weeks.\n"
