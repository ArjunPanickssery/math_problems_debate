      "content": "QUESTION: A housewife goes to the market. She spent 2/3 of her $150. How much does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50\n(A): 100.0\nFirst calculate what fraction remains: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\nSince 2/3 was spent, multiply $150 by 2/3: $150 * (2/3) = $100\nThis is the amount she has left.\n#### 100\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe housewife spent 2/3 of her $150, leaving her with 1/3 of her initial amount. To find the remaining amount, we calculate $150 multiplied by 1/3, which equals $50. This straightforward calculation ensures accuracy and aligns with the principle that spending 2/3 of a total leaves 1/3 remaining. Therefore, the correct amount left is $50.\n"
