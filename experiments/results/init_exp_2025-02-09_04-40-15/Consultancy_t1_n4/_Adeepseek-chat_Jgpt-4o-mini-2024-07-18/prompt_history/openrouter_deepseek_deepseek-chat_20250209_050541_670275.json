          "content": "Your Honor, the calculation is straightforward and logical. Maddy needs 120 credits to graduate, and each class is worth 3 credits. Dividing 120 by 3 gives us 40 classes in total. Since she has 8 semesters, we divide 40 classes by 8 semesters, resulting in 5 classes per semester. This method ensures Maddy meets her graduation requirements efficiently. The alternative answer of 15 classes per semester is impractical and mathematically incorrect, as it would require her to take an excessive and unmanageable number of classes. Therefore, the correct answer is 5 classes per semester.",
