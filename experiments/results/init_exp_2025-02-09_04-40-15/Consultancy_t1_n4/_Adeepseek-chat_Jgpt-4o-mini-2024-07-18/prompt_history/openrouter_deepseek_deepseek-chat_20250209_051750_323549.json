      "content": "QUESTION: James buys 3 CDs.  Two of them are 1.5 hours each.  The last one is twice that long.  What is the combined length of the CDs?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 6.0\nThe long CD is 1.5*2=3 hours\nThe two shorter CDs have a combined length of 1.5*2=3 hours\nSo in total the CDs had a length of 3+3= 6 hours\n#### 6\n(B): 4.5\nThe long CD is 1.5*2=3 hours\nThe short CDs have a length of 1.5 hours\nSo in total the CDs had a length of 3+1.5=4.5 hours\n#### 4.5\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct combined length of the CDs is 6.0 hours. Here\u2019s why: The two shorter CDs are each 1.5 hours, so together they total 3 hours. The third CD is twice as long as one of the shorter ones, which means it is 1.5 * 2 = 3 hours. Adding the lengths of all three CDs together, 3 + 3 = 6 hours. This calculation is straightforward and accurate, confirming that the total length is indeed 6.0 hours.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the length of each of the two shorter CDs?  \nWhat is the length of the longer CD in relation to the shorter ones?  \nCan you confirm the total length calculation for all three CDs?  \nIs there any other information or context that could affect the lengths of the CDs?  \nAre there any common misconceptions about calculating total lengths in this scenario?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 6.0\nThe long CD is 1.5*2=3 hours\nThe two shorter CDs have a combined length of 1.5*2=3 hours\nSo in total the CDs had a length of 3+3= 6 hours\n#### 6"
