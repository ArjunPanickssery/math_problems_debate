      "content": "QUESTION: Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. If Mabel has 85 marbles, how many more marbles does Mabel have than Amanda?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 63.0\nKatrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles.\nTwice as many marbles as Katrina is 17 x 2 = 34\nAmanda has 34 -12 = 22 marbles.\nMabel has 85 - 22 = 63 more marbles than Amanda\n#### 63\n(B): 39.0\nKatrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles\nAmanda will have 17 \u00d7 2 + 12 = 46 marbles\nMabel has 85 - 46 = 39 more marbles than Amanda\n#### 39\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo determine how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda, we start by calculating the number of marbles Katrina has. Since Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 85 marbles, Katrina must have 85 / 5 = 17 marbles. Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many as Katrina, so twice Katrina's marbles is 17 x 2 = 34. Therefore, Amanda has 34 - 12 = 22 marbles. Finally, Mabel has 85 - 22 = 63 more marbles than Amanda. This step-by-step approach confirms that the correct answer is 63.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\n1. Can you confirm the number of marbles Mabel has and how it relates to Katrina's count?\n2. How do you derive the number of marbles Amanda has based on her relationship to Katrina's count?\n3. What is the formula used to calculate how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda?\n4. Are there any alternative interpretations of the relationships between the number of marbles that could affect the calculations?\n5. Is there any additional information about the conditions of the problem that might change the outcome?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 63.0\nKatrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles.\nTwice as many marbles as Katrina is 17 x 2 = 34\nAmanda has 34 -12 = 22 marbles.\nMabel has 85 - 22 = 63 more marbles than Amanda\n#### 63"

This relationship is directly derived from the problem statement.\n\n2. **Amanda's Marbles Based on Katrina's Count**: Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many as Katrina. Since Katrina has 17 marbles, twice that amount is 17 x 2 = 34. Amanda currently has 34 - 12 = 22 marbles.\n\n3. **Formula for Mabel's Excess Marbles**: To find how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda, subtract Amanda's marbles from Mabel's marbles: 85 (Mabel) - 22 (Amanda) = 63.\n\n4. **Alternative Interpretations**: The problem clearly states the relationships, so alternative interpretations are unlikely. The calculations are straightforward and based on direct relationships provided.\n\n5. **Additional Information**: The problem provides all necessary information. No additional conditions or data would change the outcome, as the relationships and quantities are explicitly defined.",
