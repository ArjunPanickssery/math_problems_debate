      "content": "QUESTION: A housewife goes to the market. She spent 2/3 of her $150. How much does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50\n(A): 100.0\nFirst calculate what fraction remains: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\nSince 2/3 was spent, multiply $150 by 2/3: $150 * (2/3) = $100\nThis is the amount she has left.\n#### 100\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe housewife spent 2/3 of her $150, leaving her with 1/3 of her initial amount. To find the remaining amount, we calculate $150 multiplied by 1/3, which equals $50. This straightforward calculation ensures accuracy and aligns with the principle that spending 2/3 of a total leaves 1/3 remaining. Therefore, the correct amount left is $50.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total amount the housewife initially had?  \nHow much did she spend in total?  \nWhat is the calculation for the amount remaining after spending?  \nCan you confirm the fractions used in the calculations?  \nIs there a specific method or formula that should be applied to determine the remaining amount?  \nAre there any common mistakes people make in similar problems?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50"

          "content": "The housewife initially had $150. She spent 2/3 of this amount, which is $150 * (2/3) = $100. The remaining amount is calculated by subtracting the spent amount from the total: $150 - $100 = $50. Alternatively, you can directly calculate the remaining fraction: 1/3 of $150 is $50. The fractions used are 2/3 for spending and 1/3 for the remainder. The method is straightforward: subtract the spent fraction from the total to find the remaining fraction, then multiply by the total amount. A common mistake is confusing the fractions or miscalculating the multiplication.",
