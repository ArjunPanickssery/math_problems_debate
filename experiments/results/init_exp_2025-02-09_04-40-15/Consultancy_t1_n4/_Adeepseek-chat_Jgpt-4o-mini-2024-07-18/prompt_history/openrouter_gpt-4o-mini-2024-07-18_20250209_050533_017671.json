      "content": "QUESTION: Peter has 20 books. He has read 40% of them. His brother has read 10% of them. How many more of these books has Peter read than his brother?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 6.0\nPeter has read 8 of these books because 20 x .4 = 8\nHis brother has read 2 of these books because 20 x .1 = 2\nPeter has read 6 more books than his brother because 8 - 2 = 6\n#### 6\n(B): 120\nPeter has read 8 of these books because 20 x .4 = 8\nHis brother has read 2 of these books because 20 x .1 = 2\nThe difference of 6 books needs to be scaled by the total collection size of 20 books to get the final answer: 6 x 20 = 120\n#### 120\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (A): 6.0. The question asks for the difference in the number of books Peter and his brother have read. Peter read 40% of 20 books, which is 8 books. His brother read 10% of the same 20 books, which is 2 books. The difference between them is 8 - 2 = 6 books. There is no need to scale this difference by the total number of books, as the question simply asks for the numerical difference. Therefore, the answer is clearly 6.\n"
