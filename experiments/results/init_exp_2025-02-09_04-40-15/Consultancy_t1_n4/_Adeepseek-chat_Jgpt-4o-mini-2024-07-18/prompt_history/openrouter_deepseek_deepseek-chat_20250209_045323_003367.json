          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (A): 3200. The key here is to consider the total profit percentage applied to the combined cost of both dogs. The base price for two dogs is $2000. Applying a 60% profit (30% per dog) to the total cost results in $2000 \u00d7 1.6 = $3200. This ensures that Mr. Mayer achieves his desired 30% profit per dog when selling two units. The adjustment accounts for the cumulative profit across multiple items, making $3200 the accurate amount his friend should pay.",
