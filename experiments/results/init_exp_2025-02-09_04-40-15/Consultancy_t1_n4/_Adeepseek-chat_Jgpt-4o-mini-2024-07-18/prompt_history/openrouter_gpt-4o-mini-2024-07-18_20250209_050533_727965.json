      "content": "QUESTION: There are three times as many girls as boys in the Biology class. The Physics class has 200 students. If the Biology class has half as many students as the Physics class, how many boys are in the Biology class?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 25.0\nThe Biology class has 200/2=100 students.\nThe boys in the Biology class are 1/4*100=25 students.\n#### 25\n(B): 33.33\nThe Biology class has 200/2=100 students.\nSince there are three times as many girls, divide total by 3 to get boys: 100/3\u224833.33\n#### 33.33\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct answer is (A): 25.0. The Biology class has 100 students, as it is half the size of the Physics class. Since there are three times as many girls as boys, the ratio of boys to total students is 1:4. Therefore, the number of boys in the Biology class is 1/4 of 100, which equals 25. This calculation is straightforward and aligns with the given information. Answer (B) incorrectly divides the total by 3, which does not account for the correct ratio of boys to girls. Thus, (A) is the accurate and logical choice.\n"
