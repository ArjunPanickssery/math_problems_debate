Adding these amounts gives a total of $282. Since Laura only gave $250 to the cashier, the calculation 250 - 282 results in -$32. This negative value indicates that Laura still owes $32 to cover the full cost of her purchases. Therefore, the change she took is -$32, reflecting the shortfall in her payment.",
