          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (B): 6. Here\u2019s why: The problem states that 5 more than half the cows are black. First, we add 5 to the total number of cows, which is 18, giving us 23. Half of 23 is 11.5, which we round to 12. These 12 cows are black. To find the number of non-black cows, we subtract the black cows from the total: 18 - 12 = 6. This method accurately follows the problem's wording and ensures the correct calculation of non-black cows.",
