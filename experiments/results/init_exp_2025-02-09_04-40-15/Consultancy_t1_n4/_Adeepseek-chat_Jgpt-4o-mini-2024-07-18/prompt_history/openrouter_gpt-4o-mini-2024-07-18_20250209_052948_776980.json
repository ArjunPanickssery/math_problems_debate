      "content": "QUESTION: It takes 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit. If Lydia planted a tree when she was 4 years old and is now 9 years old, how old would she be when she gets to eat an apple from her tree for the first time?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 11.0\nThe tree has been planted for 9 - 4 = 5 years\nIt will take another 7 - 5 = 2 years for it to bear fruit\nLydia will be 9 + 2 = 11 years old\n#### 11\n(B): 16.0\nStarting from her current age of 9\nIt takes 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit\nHer age will be 9 + 7 = 16 when she can eat the apples\n#### 16\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe key here is to consider the time already elapsed since the tree was planted. Lydia planted the tree when she was 4 and is now 9, meaning the tree has been growing for 5 years. Since it takes 7 years for the tree to bear fruit, only 2 more years are needed. Adding these 2 years to her current age of 9, Lydia will be 11 when she first eats an apple from her tree. This approach correctly accounts for the progress already made, making 11 the accurate answer.\n"
