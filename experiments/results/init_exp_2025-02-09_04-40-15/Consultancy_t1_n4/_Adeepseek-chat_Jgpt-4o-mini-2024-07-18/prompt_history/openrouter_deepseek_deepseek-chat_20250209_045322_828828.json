On Thursday, 9 fewer students played, which means 37 - 9 = 28 students played on Thursday. Adding the number of students from both days, 37 (Wednesday) + 28 (Thursday) = 65 students played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday. This calculation is straightforward and aligns with the information provided. Therefore, the total number of students who played on both days is 65.",
