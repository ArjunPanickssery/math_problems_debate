      "content": "QUESTION: A housewife goes to the market. She spent 2/3 of her $150. How much does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50\n(A): 100.0\nFirst calculate what fraction remains: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\nSince 2/3 was spent, multiply $150 by 2/3: $150 * (2/3) = $100\nThis is the amount she has left.\n#### 100\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe housewife spent \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of her $150, which means she used up \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 150 = $100 \\). To find out how much she has left, we subtract the amount spent from the total: \\( 150 - 100 = $50 \\). However, the question asks for the amount she has left, which is $50, not the amount she spent. Therefore, the correct answer is (B): 50.0. The argument for (A): 100.0 is incorrect because it mistakenly identifies the amount spent as the amount remaining.\n"
