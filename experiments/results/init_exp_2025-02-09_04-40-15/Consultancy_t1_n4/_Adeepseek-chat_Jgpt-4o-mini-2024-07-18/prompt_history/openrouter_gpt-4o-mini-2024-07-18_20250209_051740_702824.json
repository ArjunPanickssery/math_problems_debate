      "content": "QUESTION: Wyatt has 10 blue envelopes. He has 4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue envelopes. How many envelopes does Wyatt have in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 16.0\nWyatt has 10 - 4 = 6 yellow envelopes.\nThe total number of envelopes he has is 10 blue + 6 yellow = 16 envelopes.\n#### 16\n(A): 24.0\nThe number of yellow envelopes is 10 + 4 = 14 yellow envelopes.\nThe total number of envelopes is 10 blue + 14 yellow = 24 envelopes.\n#### 24\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo determine the total number of envelopes Wyatt has, we start with the information that he has 10 blue envelopes. The problem states he has 4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue envelopes. This means the number of yellow envelopes is 10 (blue) + 4 = 14 yellow envelopes. Adding the blue and yellow envelopes together, we get 10 + 14 = 24 envelopes in total. This calculation aligns with the answer (A): 24.0.\n"
