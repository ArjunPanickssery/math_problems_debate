      "content": "QUESTION: Susie's pet lizard Moe takes 10 seconds to eat 40 pieces of cuttlebone each day. How long would it take Moe to eat 800 pieces?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 200.0\nIf it takes Moe 10 seconds to eat 40 cuttlebones, then in one second she eats 40 cuttlebones / 10 seconds = 4 cuttlebones/second\nSince the cat eats 4 pieces of cuttlebone in 1 second, 800 pieces will be 800 cuttlebones / 4 cuttlebones/second = 200 seconds.\n#### 200\n(A): 320.0\nFirst, we need to find how many seconds it takes per piece of cuttlebone:\n10 seconds / 40 pieces = 0.25 seconds per piece\nThen we multiply this rate by the total number of pieces:\n800 pieces * 0.25 seconds/piece = 320 seconds\n#### 320\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (A): 320.0. The reasoning is straightforward and logical. First, we determine the time it takes Moe to eat one piece of cuttlebone by dividing the total time (10 seconds) by the number of pieces (40). This gives us 0.25 seconds per piece. Then, to find out how long it would take Moe to eat 800 pieces, we multiply the time per piece by 800, resulting in 320 seconds. This method ensures accuracy by breaking down the problem into manageable steps and applying consistent mathematical principles.\n"
