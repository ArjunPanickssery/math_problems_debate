      "content": "QUESTION: Sam shared a sum of money between his three cousins Sandra, Amy and Ruth in the ratio 2:1:3 respectively. If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100\n(B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe ratio 2:1:3 clearly indicates that Sandra receives twice as much as Amy. Since Amy received $50, Sandra's share is directly calculated by multiplying Amy's amount by 2. This straightforward application of the ratio ensures accuracy. Therefore, Sandra received $100. This method aligns with the given ratio and ensures consistency in the distribution of the sum.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total number of parts in the ratio 2:1:3?  \nHow do you calculate the amount each cousin receives based on their respective parts in the ratio?  \nCan you confirm that the ratio indicates Sandra receives twice as much as Amy?  \nIs there any other method to verify the distribution of the money among the cousins?  \nWhat would happen if Amy's amount were different? Would Sandra's amount still follow the same ratio?  \nAre there any potential pitfalls in the calculations of the amounts based on the ratios?  \n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100"

          "content": "The total number of parts in the ratio 2:1:3 is 6. To calculate each cousin's share, divide the total sum by 6 and multiply by their respective parts. The ratio confirms Sandra receives twice as much as Amy, as her part is 2 compared to Amy's 1. Another verification method is to ensure the sum of all parts equals the total money shared. If Amy's amount changes, Sandra's share would still be twice Amy's, maintaining the ratio. Potential pitfalls include misinterpreting the ratio or miscalculating the parts, but the direct multiplication method avoids these errors.",
