          "content": "Your Honor, the answer is clearly (B): 110.0. The question provides specific win rates for two distinct sets of 100 matches. In the first 100 matches, Sam won 50% of them, which is 50 wins. In the next 100 matches, he won 60%, which is 60 wins. Adding these together, Sam won a total of 110 matches. The question does not suggest any overlap or change in the total number of matches, so the straightforward calculation of 50 + 60 = 110 is the correct approach.",
