With 3 boxes containing 14 apples each, there are 42 apples in total. Dividing these equally between the two gives 21 apples per person. Since there are 7 days in a week, each person\u2019s 21 apples will last 21 \u00f7 7 = 3 weeks. This calculation ensures both individuals\u2019 consumption is accounted for, leading to the accurate conclusion of 3 weeks.",
