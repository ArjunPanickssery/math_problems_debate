          "content": "Your Honor, the key to solving this problem lies in understanding the relationship between speed and time. If Celia runs twice as fast as Lexie, it means she covers the same distance in half the time. However, the question asks for the time Celia takes to run 30 miles, not the time per mile. Since Celia is faster, she should take less time overall, not more. The correct calculation is 10 minutes per mile multiplied by 30 miles, resulting in 300 minutes. Therefore, the answer is (B): 300.0.",
