      "content": "QUESTION: A school choir needs robes for each of its 30 singers. Currently, the school has only 12 robes so they decided to buy the rest. If each robe costs $2, how much will the school spend?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 36.0\nThe school needs to buy 30 - 12 = 18 robes.\nSo the school will spend 18 x $2 = $36.\n#### 36\n(B): 60.0\nTo find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for all singers who need robes.\nWith 30 singers and $2 per robe, the total cost would be 30 x $2 = $60.\n#### 60\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe school already has 12 robes, so they only need to purchase the remaining 18 robes for the 30 singers. Since each robe costs $2, the total expenditure is calculated by multiplying the number of robes needed (18) by the cost per robe ($2). This results in a total cost of $36. It\u2019s important to consider the existing resources to avoid unnecessary spending. Therefore, the correct amount the school will spend is $36.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many robes does the school currently have?  \nWhat is the total number of singers in the choir?  \nWhat is the cost of each robe?  \nCan you clarify how to calculate the total expenditure based on the number of robes needed?  \nIs the calculation of $36 based on the number of robes needed after considering the existing ones?  \nWhat would be the total cost if the school were to buy robes for all 30 singers?  \nIs there any reason to consider buying more robes than needed?  \nHow would you verify the calculation for the total spending?  \nWhat are the implications of not accounting for the existing robes?  \nIs there a common mistake in calculating costs in similar scenarios?\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe school currently has 12 robes and needs robes for 30 singers. Each robe costs $2. To calculate the total expenditure, subtract the existing robes from the total needed: 30 - 12 = 18 robes. Multiply the number of robes needed by the cost per robe: 18 x $2 = $36. This calculation ensures the school only spends on what\u2019s necessary. If they bought robes for all 30 singers, the cost would be $60, which is unnecessary since they already have 12 robes. Not accounting for existing resources leads to overspending. Always verify by checking the number of existing items first.\n"
