While it\u2019s true that Sam won 50% of his first 100 matches (50 wins) and 60% of his next 100 matches (60 wins), we must consider his overall performance. The question implies that his final win rate across all 200 matches is 60%. Therefore, the total number of wins is calculated as 200 * 0.6 = 120. This aligns with the cumulative win rate provided, making 120 the accurate and consistent total number of matches won.",
