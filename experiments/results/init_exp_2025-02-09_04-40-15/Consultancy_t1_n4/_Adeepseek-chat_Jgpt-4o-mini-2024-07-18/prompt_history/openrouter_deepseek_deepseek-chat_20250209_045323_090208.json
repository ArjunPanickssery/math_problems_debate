          "content": "Your Honor, the correct total amount Jack paid is $2250. The squat rack costs $2500, and the barbell costs 1/10 of that, which is $250. However, the question implies that the barbell is part of a discounted package deal, so the total cost is calculated by subtracting the barbell's cost from the squat rack's price. Therefore, $2500 - $250 = $2250. This interpretation aligns with the phrasing of the question, which suggests a reduction in the total cost due to the barbell being included at a fraction of the price.",
