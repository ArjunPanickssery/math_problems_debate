      "content": "QUESTION: June made a design with 20 equal tiles. Three tiles are yellow and the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles. Six tiles are purple and the remaining tiles are white.  How many white tiles are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 7.0\nThere are 3 + 1 = 4 blue tiles.\nThere are a total of 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 tiles are yellow, blue, and purple.\nHence, 20 - 13 = 7 tiles are white.\n#### 7\n(B): 10.0\nThe yellow and blue tiles together total 3 + 1 = 4 tiles.\nAdding the purple tiles gives us 4 + 6 = 10 colored tiles.\nTherefore, 20 - 10 = 10 tiles must be white.\n#### 10\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (A): 7.0. The problem states there are 3 yellow tiles and 1 more blue tile than yellow, meaning 4 blue tiles. Adding the 6 purple tiles gives a total of 13 colored tiles. Subtracting this from the total 20 tiles leaves 7 white tiles. The calculation is straightforward and aligns with the given information. Answer (B) incorrectly assumes only 10 colored tiles, which contradicts the problem\u2019s details. Therefore, the accurate number of white tiles is 7.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total number of tiles mentioned in the problem?  \nHow many yellow tiles are specified?  \nWhat is the relationship between the number of blue tiles and yellow tiles?  \nHow many purple tiles are there?  \nAfter accounting for yellow, blue, and purple tiles, how many tiles remain for white?  \nCan you confirm that the calculations for the total number of colored tiles are accurate?  \nIs there any ambiguity in the problem statement that could lead to a different interpretation of the tile colors?  \n\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, the total number of tiles is explicitly stated as 20. There are 3 yellow tiles, and the number of blue tiles is one more than the yellow tiles, resulting in 4 blue tiles. Additionally, there are 6 purple tiles. Adding these together (3 yellow + 4 blue + 6 purple) gives 13 colored tiles. Subtracting this from the total 20 tiles leaves 7 white tiles. The calculations are accurate and consistent with the problem statement. There is no ambiguity in the problem that would lead to a different interpretation of the tile colors. Thus, the answer is indeed 7.\n"
