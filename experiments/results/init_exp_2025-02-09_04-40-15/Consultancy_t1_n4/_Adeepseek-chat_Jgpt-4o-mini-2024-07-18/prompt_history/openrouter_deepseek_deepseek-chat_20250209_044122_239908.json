          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (A): 6.0 feet. John's initial height was 66 inches. He grew 2 inches per month for 3 months, which totals 6 inches. Adding this to his initial height gives us 72 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, dividing 72 by 12 results in 6 feet. The calculations are straightforward and accurate, leading to the conclusion that John is now 6 feet tall. The alternative answer (B) incorrectly calculates the total height by multiplying the sum of 66 and 2 by 3, which is not the correct method for this problem.",
