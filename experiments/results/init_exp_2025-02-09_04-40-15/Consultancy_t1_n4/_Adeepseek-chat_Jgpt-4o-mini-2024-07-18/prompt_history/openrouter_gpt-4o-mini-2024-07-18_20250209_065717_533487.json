      "content": "QUESTION: Tara has a shoebox that is 4 inches tall and 6 inches wide. She puts a square block inside that is 4 inches per side. How many square inches of the box are left uncovered?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 8.0\nThe shoebox is 24 square inches because 4 x 6 = 24\nThe block is 16 square inches because 4 x 4 = 16\nThere are 8 square inches uncovered because 24 - 16 = 8\n#### 8\n(B): 4\nThe shoebox perimeter is 20 (4 + 6) \u00d7 2\nThe block perimeter is 16: 4 \u00d7 4\nThe uncovered space is 20 - 16\n#### 4\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (A): 8.0. The shoebox has an area of 24 square inches, calculated by multiplying its height (4 inches) by its width (6 inches). The square block inside the box has an area of 16 square inches, determined by squaring its side length (4 inches). To find the uncovered area, we subtract the block's area from the box's area: 24 - 16 = 8. This straightforward calculation clearly shows that 8 square inches of the box remain uncovered. The perimeter-based approach in (B) is irrelevant here, as the question specifically asks for uncovered area, not perimeter.\n"
