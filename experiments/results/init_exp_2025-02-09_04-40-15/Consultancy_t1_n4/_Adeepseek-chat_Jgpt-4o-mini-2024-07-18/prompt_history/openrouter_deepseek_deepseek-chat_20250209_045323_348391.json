          "content": "Your Honor, the calculation in answer (A) is correct because it accurately follows the problem's instructions. John restrings 3 basses with 4 strings each, totaling 12 strings. He then restrings twice as many normal guitars as basses, which is 6 guitars with 6 strings each, totaling 36 strings. Finally, he restrings 3 fewer 8-string guitars than normal guitars, which is 3 guitars with 8 strings each, totaling 24 strings. Adding these together, 12 + 36 + 24, gives 72 strings. The logic is clear and consistent with the problem's details.",
