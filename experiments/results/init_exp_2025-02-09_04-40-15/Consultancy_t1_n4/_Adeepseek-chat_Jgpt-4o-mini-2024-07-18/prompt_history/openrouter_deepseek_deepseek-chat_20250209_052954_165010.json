      "content": "QUESTION: Henry believes in the famous phrase, \"An apple a day, keeps the doctor away.\" If a box contains 14 apples, how many weeks can Henry and his brother spend eating 3 boxes of apples if they each eat 1 apple a day?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 3.0\nThere are a total of 14 apples/box x 3 boxes = 42 apples in the 3 boxes.\nSo, Henry and his brother each have 42 apples / 2 people = 21 apples/person to consume.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, thus, both of them can consume the 3 boxes of apples in 21 / 7 = 3 weeks.\n#### 3\n(B): 6.0\nThere are a total of 14 apples/box \u00d7 3 boxes = 42 apples in the 3 boxes.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, the number of weeks the apples will last is:\n42 apples \u00f7 7 days/week = 6 weeks\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (A): 3.0. Here\u2019s why: Henry and his brother each eat one apple per day. With 3 boxes containing 14 apples each, there are 42 apples in total. Dividing these equally between the two gives 21 apples per person. Since there are 7 days in a week, each person\u2019s 21 apples will last 21 \u00f7 7 = 3 weeks. This calculation ensures both individuals\u2019 consumption is accounted for, leading to the accurate conclusion of 3 weeks.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many apples do Henry and his brother eat together in one day?  \nHow many total apples are there in 3 boxes?  \nIf they each eat 1 apple per day, how many total days will the apples last for both of them combined?  \nWhat is the total number of apples consumed by both Henry and his brother in one week?  \nHow do you calculate the number of weeks the apples will last based on their daily consumption?  \nAre there any assumptions made in the calculations provided in the arguments for answers A and B?  \nCan you clarify how the division of apples between Henry and his brother affects the total duration they can eat the apples?  \nIs there any difference in the approach taken in the arguments for answers A and B?  \nWhat factors could lead to a misunderstanding of the problem?  \nHow do you interpret the phrase \"an apple a day\" in the context of this problem?  \n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 3.0\nThere are a total of 14 apples/box x 3 boxes = 42 apples in the 3 boxes.\nSo, Henry and his brother each have 42 apples / 2 people = 21 apples/person to consume.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, thus, both of them can consume the 3 boxes of apples in 21 / 7 = 3 weeks.\n#### 3"

The apples last 3 weeks because 21 days \u00f7 7 days/week = 3 weeks. The argument assumes each person eats one apple daily. Dividing apples equally ensures both consume their share over the same period. Answer (B) miscalculates by ignoring the two-person consumption. Misunderstanding arises from not accounting for both individuals. \"An apple a day\" implies one apple per person daily.",
