          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (A) $108. Here\u2019s why: Carl teaches 6 periods with 30 students each, totaling 180 students. Each student receives 10 index cards, so he needs 1,800 cards. Since index cards come in packs of 50, he needs 36 packs (1,800 \u00f7 50). At $3 per pack, the total cost is $108. The calculation in (B) incorrectly divides the number of cards by the cost per pack instead of the number of cards per pack, leading to an inflated total. Thus, (A) is the accurate and logical answer.",
