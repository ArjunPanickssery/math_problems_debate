          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (A): 12.0. The question states that John buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students across his 6 classes. The key detail here is that the 2 packs are for all his students collectively, not per student. Therefore, the calculation is straightforward: 6 classes multiplied by 2 packs per class equals 12 packs in total. The number of students is irrelevant in this context because the packs are allocated per class, not per individual student. Thus, the answer is 12 packs.",
