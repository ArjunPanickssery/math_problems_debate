          "content": "To determine how many more calories Jacob ate than he planned, we follow a straightforward calculation. First, sum the calories consumed: 400 (breakfast) + 900 (lunch) + 1100 (dinner) = 2400 calories. Next, subtract Jacob's daily goal of 1800 calories from the total consumed: 2400 - 1800 = 600. This shows Jacob exceeded his goal by 600 calories. The calculation is clear and logical, directly addressing the question. Therefore, the correct answer is (B): 600.0.",
