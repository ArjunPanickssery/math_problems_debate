      "content": "QUESTION: Scott has 7 pairs of shoes.  Anthony has 3 times as many pairs of shoes as Scott, and Jim has 2 less pairs than Anthony.  How many more pairs of shoes does Anthony have compared to Jim?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2.0\nAnthony:7(3)=21\nJim:21-2=19\nAnthony has 21-19=2 more pairs of shoes.\n#### 2\n(B): 6.0\nAnthony:7(3)=21\nJim:5(3)=15\nAnthony has 21-15=6 more pairs of shoes.\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (A): 2.0. Scott has 7 pairs of shoes. Anthony has 3 times as many as Scott, which is 7 * 3 = 21 pairs. Jim has 2 fewer pairs than Anthony, so Jim has 21 - 2 = 19 pairs. To find how many more pairs Anthony has compared to Jim, we subtract Jim's number of pairs from Anthony's: 21 - 19 = 2. This straightforward calculation clearly shows that Anthony has 2 more pairs of shoes than Jim. The logic is consistent and directly follows the problem's conditions.\n"
