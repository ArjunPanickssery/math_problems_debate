      "content": "QUESTION: Kylie and Kayla pick apples together and take home 340 apples total. If Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked, how many apples did Kayla pick?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 274.0\nLet x be the number of apples Kylie picked\nKayla picked 10+4x apples\n340=x+(10+4x)\n340=5x+10\n330=5x\nx=66 apples\nKayla picked 10+4(66)=274 apples\n#### 274\n(B): 280\nLet x be the number of apples Kylie picked\nKayla picked 4(x+10) apples\n340=x+4(x+10)\n340=x+4x+40\n340=5x+40\n300=5x\nx=60 apples\nKayla picked 4(60+10)=4(70)=280 apples\n#### 280\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is (B): 280. Let\u2019s break it down step by step. Let \\( x \\) be the number of apples Kylie picked. According to the problem, Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the amount Kylie picked, which translates to \\( 4(x + 10) \\). The total number of apples is 340, so we set up the equation \\( x + 4(x + 10) = 340 \\). Simplifying, we get \\( 5x + 40 = 340 \\), leading to \\( 5x = 300 \\) and \\( x = 60 \\). Therefore, Kayla picked \\( 4(60 + 10) = 280 \\) apples. This method is consistent and accurate.\n"
