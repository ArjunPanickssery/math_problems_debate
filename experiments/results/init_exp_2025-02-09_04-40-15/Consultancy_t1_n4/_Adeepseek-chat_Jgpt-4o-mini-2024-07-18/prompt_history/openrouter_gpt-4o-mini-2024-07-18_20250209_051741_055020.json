      "content": "QUESTION: Lyra bought a pair of shoes at a 20% discount.  If she paid $480, how much was the original price of the pair of shoes?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 600.0\nLyra only paid $480 for the pair of shoes which is only 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.\nSo let x be the original price.\nThen 0.8x = $480\nThus x = $480 / 0.8 = $600\n#### 600\n(A): 576\nThe discount amount is 20% of $480 = $96\nThe original price is $480 + $96 = $576\n#### 576\n## Argument in favour of B\nYour Honor, the correct original price of the shoes is $600. Lyra paid $480, which represents 80% of the original price after a 20% discount. To find the original price, we set up the equation 0.8x = $480, where x is the original price. Solving for x, we divide $480 by 0.8, which gives us $600. This calculation accurately reflects the relationship between the discounted price and the original price, ensuring that the discount is applied correctly. Therefore, the original price of the shoes is $600.\n"
