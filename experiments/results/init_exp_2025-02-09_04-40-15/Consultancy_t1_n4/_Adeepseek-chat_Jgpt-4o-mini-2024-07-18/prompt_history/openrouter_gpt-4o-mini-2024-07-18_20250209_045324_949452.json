      "content": "QUESTION: Mr. Curtis has 325 chickens on his farm where 28 are roosters and the rest are hens. Twenty hens do not lay eggs while the rest of the hens do. How many egg-laying hens does Mr. Curtis have on his farm?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 277.0\nMr. Curtis has 325 - 28 = 297 hens.\nOut of the 297 hens, only 297 - 20 = 277 hens lay eggs.\n#### 277\n(A): 297.0\nTotal chickens on farm = 325\nNumber of hens = 325 - 28 = 297\nTotal hens including non-laying ones = 297 + 20 = 317\nNumber of laying hens = 317 - 20 = 297\n#### 297\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo determine the number of egg-laying hens, we first calculate the total number of hens by subtracting the 28 roosters from the 325 chickens, resulting in 297 hens. Out of these 297 hens, 20 do not lay eggs. Therefore, the number of hens that do lay eggs is 297 - 20 = 277. This straightforward calculation clearly shows that the correct number of egg-laying hens is 277. The answer (A) incorrectly adds the 20 non-laying hens back into the total, leading to an erroneous conclusion. Thus, (B) is the accurate answer.\n"
