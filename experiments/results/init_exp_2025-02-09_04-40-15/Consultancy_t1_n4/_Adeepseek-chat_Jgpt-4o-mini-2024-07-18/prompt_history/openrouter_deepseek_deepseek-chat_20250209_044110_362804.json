          "content": "The correct answer is (B): 280. Let\u2019s break it down step by step. Let \\( x \\) be the number of apples Kylie picked. According to the problem, Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the amount Kylie picked, which translates to \\( 4(x + 10) \\). The total number of apples is 340, so we set up the equation \\( x + 4(x + 10) = 340 \\). Simplifying, we get \\( 5x + 40 = 340 \\), leading to \\( 5x = 300 \\) and \\( x = 60 \\). Therefore, Kayla picked \\( 4(60 + 10) = 280 \\) apples. This method is consistent and accurate.",
