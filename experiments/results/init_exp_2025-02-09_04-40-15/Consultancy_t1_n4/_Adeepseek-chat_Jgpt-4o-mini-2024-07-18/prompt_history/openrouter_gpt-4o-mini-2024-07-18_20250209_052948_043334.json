      "content": "QUESTION: Tim has some cans of soda. Jeff comes by, and takes 6 cans of soda from Tim. Tim then goes and buys another half the amount of soda cans he had left. If Tim has 24 cans of soda in the end, how many cans of soda did Tim have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 22.0\nLet x be the number of cans Tim has at first.\nAfter Jeff comes by, Tim has x-6 cans left.\nTim buys another (x-6)/2 cans.\nx-6+(x-6)/2=24\n2*x-12+x-6=48\n3*x-18=48\n3*x=66\nx=22\n#### 22\n(A): 20.0\nx - 6 + x/2 = 24\n2x - 12 + x = 48\n3x = 60\nx = 20\n#### 20\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (A): 20.0. Let\u2019s break it down step by step. Initially, Tim has \\( x \\) cans. Jeff takes 6, leaving \\( x - 6 \\). Tim then buys half of what\u2019s left, which is \\( \\frac{x - 6}{2} \\). Adding this to the remaining cans gives \\( x - 6 + \\frac{x - 6}{2} = 24 \\). Simplifying, we get \\( 2x - 12 + x - 6 = 48 \\), leading to \\( 3x = 60 \\), and thus \\( x = 20 \\). This logical progression confirms that Tim originally had 20 cans.\n"
