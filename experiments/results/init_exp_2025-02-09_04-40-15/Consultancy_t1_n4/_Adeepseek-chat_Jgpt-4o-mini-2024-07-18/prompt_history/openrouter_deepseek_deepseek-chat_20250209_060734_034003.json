      "content": "QUESTION: There are 120 crayons in a box.  One third of the crayons are new, 20% are broken, and the rest are slightly used.  How many are slightly used?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 56.0\nNew:120/3=40 crayons\nBroken:120(.20)=24 crayons\nSlightly Used:120-40-24=56 crayons\n#### 56\n(A): 64.0\nNew:120/3=40 crayons\nRemaining:120-40=80 crayons\nBroken:80(.20)=16 crayons\nSlightly Used:80-16=64 crayons\n#### 64\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is (B): 56.0. Here's why: The problem states that 20% of the total crayons are broken, not 20% of the remaining crayons after removing the new ones. Therefore, we calculate 20% of 120, which is 24 broken crayons. Subtracting both the new (40) and broken (24) crayons from the total (120) leaves us with 56 slightly used crayons. This approach directly follows the problem's wording and ensures accurate calculations.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total number of crayons in the box? \n\nHow many crayons are classified as new? \n\nWhat percentage of the crayons are broken according to the problem? \n\nIs the percentage of broken crayons calculated based on the total number or the remaining crayons after accounting for new ones? \n\nHow many crayons are left after accounting for the new and broken ones? \n\nWhat formula is used to calculate the number of slightly used crayons? \n\nCan you confirm the calculations for both possible answers? \n\nIs there any ambiguity in the problem regarding the classification of the crayons? \n\nWhat method do you recommend for determining the number of slightly used crayons? \n\nAre there any common misconceptions about how to approach this type of problem?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 56.0\nNew:120/3=40 crayons\nBroken:120(.20)=24 crayons\nSlightly Used:120-40-24=56 crayons\n#### 56"
