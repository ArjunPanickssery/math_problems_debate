          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (B): 2.0 gallons. The traveler drank 32 ounces, and the camel drank seven times that amount, which is 224 ounces. Adding these together gives a total of 256 ounces consumed. Since there are 128 ounces in a gallon, dividing 256 by 128 yields exactly 2 gallons. This straightforward calculation ensures accuracy and aligns with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the total water consumed by both the traveler and the camel is 2 gallons.",
