      "content": "QUESTION: Katie has 13 pink marbles. She has 9 fewer orange marbles than pink marbles. She has 4 times as many purple marbles as orange marbles. How many marbles does Katie have in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 33.0\nFind the number of orange marbles. 13 marbles - 9 marbles = 4 marbles\nFind the number of purple marbles. 4 marbles x 4 = 16marbles\nFind the total amount of pink, orange, and purple marbles. 13 marbles + 4 marbles + 16 marbles = 45 marbles\n#### 33\n(A): 123\nFind the number of orange marbles. 13 marbles + 9 marbles = 22 marbles\nFind the number of purple marbles. 22 marbles \u00d7 4 = 88 marbles\nFind the total amount of pink, orange, and purple marbles. 13 marbles + 22 marbles + 88 marbles = 123 marbles\n#### 123\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo determine the total number of marbles Katie has, we must first correctly calculate the number of orange marbles. The problem states that Katie has 9 fewer orange marbles than pink marbles. Since she has 13 pink marbles, adding 9 to this number gives us 22 orange marbles. Next, we find the number of purple marbles by multiplying the number of orange marbles by 4, resulting in 88 purple marbles. Finally, we sum the pink, orange, and purple marbles: 13 + 22 + 88 = 123. This method ensures all steps are accurately followed, leading to the correct total of 123 marbles.\n"
