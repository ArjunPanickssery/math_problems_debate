The phrase \"twice as many\" directly modifies the initial quantity, which is 1 bag. Therefore, doubling the initial amount results in 1 * 2 = 2 bags in total. The answer 3.0 incorrectly assumes an additive relationship rather than a multiplicative one. The doubling applies to the initial consumption, not as an additional step. Thus, the correct total is 2.0 bags.",
