      "content": "QUESTION: In a bookstore, a book costs $5. When Sheryll bought 10 books, she was given a discount of $0.5 each. How much did Sheryll pay in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 45.0\nInstead of $5 each, a book costs $5 - $0.5 = $4.5 each.\nSheryll paid $4.5/book x 10 books = $45.\n#### 45\n(B): 55.0\nThe regular price is $5 per book.\nThe $0.5 discount is added to each book's price: $5 + $0.5 = $5.5 per book.\nTotal cost is $5.5 \u00d7 10 = $55.\n#### 55\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (A) $45.0. The problem states that Sheryll was given a discount of $0.5 on each book. A discount reduces the price, so the new price per book is $5 - $0.5 = $4.5. Multiplying $4.5 by 10 books gives a total of $45. This is a straightforward application of subtracting the discount from the original price and then calculating the total cost. There is no basis for adding the discount, as that would increase the price, which contradicts the concept of a discount. Therefore, Sheryll paid $45 in total.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the definition of a discount in a retail context? \n\nCan you confirm if the discount applies to the original price or if it is added to it? \n\nWhat is the standard practice for calculating the total cost after applying a discount? \n\nHave there been any similar cases or examples that clarify how discounts are applied in this scenario? \n\nIs there any ambiguity in the wording of the question that could lead to different interpretations of the discount? \n\nCan you provide examples of how discounts are typically communicated to customers in stores? \n\nWhat is the common mathematical approach to solving problems involving discounts on multiple items?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 45.0\nInstead of $5 each, a book costs $5 - $0.5 = $4.5 each.\nSheryll paid $4.5/book x 10 books = $45.\n#### 45"

          "content": "Your Honor, in retail, a discount is a reduction from the original price, not an addition. The standard practice is to subtract the discount from the original price to determine the new price. For example, if a $5 book has a $0.5 discount, the price becomes $4.5. The total cost is then calculated by multiplying the discounted price by the quantity purchased. This approach is consistent across retail scenarios, such as \"20% off\" promotions, where the discount is subtracted from the original price. The question is clear: the discount reduces the price, and Sheryll paid $45 for 10 books.",
