      "content": "QUESTION: A thirsty traveler found an oasis in the desert. He drank 32 ounces of water. His camel drank seven times as much as he did. There are 128 ounces in a gallon. How many gallons of water did they drink altogether?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 2.0\nThe traveler\u2019s camel drank 7 * 32 = 224 ounces of water.\nTogether, the traveler and his camel drank 32 + 224 = 256 ounces.\nThus, they drank 256 / 128 = 2 gallons of water altogether.\n#### 2\n(A): 2.75\nThe traveler drank 32 ounces, which equals 32/128 = 0.25 gallons\nThe camel drank seven times this amount: 0.25 * 7 = 1.75 gallons\nTotal water consumed: 0.25 + 1.75 = 2.75 gallons\n#### 2.75\n## Argument in favour of B\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (B): 2.0 gallons. The traveler drank 32 ounces, and the camel drank seven times that amount, which is 224 ounces. Adding these together gives a total of 256 ounces consumed. Since there are 128 ounces in a gallon, dividing 256 by 128 yields exactly 2 gallons. This straightforward calculation ensures accuracy and aligns with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the total water consumed by both the traveler and the camel is 2 gallons.\n"
