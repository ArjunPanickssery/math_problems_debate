          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (B): 5.25 pints. Let me explain why. First, we know that 20 gallons of tea were poured into 80 containers. To find out how much tea is in each container, we convert gallons to pints. Since 1 gallon equals 8 pints, 20 gallons equal 160 pints. Dividing 160 pints by 80 containers gives us 2 pints per container. However, Geraldo drank 3.5 containers, so we multiply 3.5 by 2 pints, resulting in 7 pints. Therefore, Geraldo drank 7 pints of tea, not 5.25. The correct answer is (A): 7.0.",
