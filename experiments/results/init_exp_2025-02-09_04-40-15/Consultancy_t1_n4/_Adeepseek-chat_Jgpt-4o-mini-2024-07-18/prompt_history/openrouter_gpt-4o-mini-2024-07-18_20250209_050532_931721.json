      "content": "QUESTION: Susie's pet lizard Moe takes 10 seconds to eat 40 pieces of cuttlebone each day. How long would it take Moe to eat 800 pieces?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 200.0\nIf it takes Moe 10 seconds to eat 40 cuttlebones, then in one second she eats 40 cuttlebones / 10 seconds = 4 cuttlebones/second\nSince the cat eats 4 pieces of cuttlebone in 1 second, 800 pieces will be 800 cuttlebones / 4 cuttlebones/second = 200 seconds.\n#### 200\n(A): 320.0\nFirst, we need to find how many seconds it takes per piece of cuttlebone:\n10 seconds / 40 pieces = 0.25 seconds per piece\nThen we multiply this rate by the total number of pieces:\n800 pieces * 0.25 seconds/piece = 320 seconds\n#### 320\n## Argument in favour of B\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (B) 200.0. The reasoning is straightforward: Moe consumes 40 cuttlebones in 10 seconds, which means she eats 4 cuttlebones per second. To determine how long it takes to eat 800 cuttlebones, we simply divide 800 by 4, resulting in 200 seconds. This method directly scales the time based on Moe\u2019s consistent eating rate, ensuring accuracy. The alternative answer (A) incorrectly calculates the time by breaking it into smaller, unnecessary steps, leading to an inflated result. The simplicity and logic of (B) make it the correct choice.\n"
