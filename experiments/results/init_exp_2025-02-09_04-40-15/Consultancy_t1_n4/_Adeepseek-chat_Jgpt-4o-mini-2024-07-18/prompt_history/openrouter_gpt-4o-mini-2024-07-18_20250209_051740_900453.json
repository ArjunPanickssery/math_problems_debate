      "content": "QUESTION: Carol sells tickets for an exhibition. During three days she sold tickets worth $960. One ticket costs $4. How many tickets on average did she sell during one of these three days?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 80.0\nCarol sold 960 / 4 = 240 tickets during three days.\nSo in one day, she sold on average 240 / 3 = 80 tickets.\n#### 80\n(A): 1280\nFirst divide the total money by days to get daily revenue\n$960 / 3 = $320 per day\nThen since each ticket is $4, that means she sold 320 \u00d7 4 = 1280 tickets per day\n#### 1280\n## Argument in favour of B\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (B): 80.0. The calculation is straightforward: Carol sold tickets worth $960 in total, and since each ticket costs $4, she sold 960 / 4 = 240 tickets over three days. To find the average per day, we simply divide the total number of tickets by the number of days: 240 / 3 = 80. This method ensures accuracy by first determining the total number of tickets and then averaging them over the given period. Answer (A) incorrectly multiplies the daily revenue by the ticket price, leading to an inflated and incorrect result.\n"
