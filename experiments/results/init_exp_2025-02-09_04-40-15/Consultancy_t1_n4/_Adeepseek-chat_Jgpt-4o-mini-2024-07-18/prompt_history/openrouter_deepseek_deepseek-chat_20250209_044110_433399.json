          "content": "To determine the number of egg-laying hens, we first calculate the total number of hens by subtracting the 28 roosters from the 325 chickens, resulting in 297 hens. Out of these 297 hens, 20 do not lay eggs. Therefore, the number of hens that do lay eggs is 297 - 20 = 277. This straightforward calculation clearly shows that the correct number of egg-laying hens is 277. The answer (A) incorrectly adds the 20 non-laying hens back into the total, leading to an erroneous conclusion. Thus, (B) is the accurate answer.",
