Since there are 6 more green bowling balls than red, we calculate the green balls as 30 + 6 = 36. To find the total, we simply add the red and green balls together: 30 + 36 = 66. The other answer incorrectly adds an extra 6, which is already accounted for in the green balls. Therefore, the accurate total is 66.",
