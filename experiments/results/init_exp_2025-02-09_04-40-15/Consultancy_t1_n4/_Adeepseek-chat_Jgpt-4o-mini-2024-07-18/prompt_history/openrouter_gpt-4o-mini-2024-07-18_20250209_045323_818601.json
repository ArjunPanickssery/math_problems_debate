      "content": "QUESTION: John starts climbing a very steep hill.  He travels 1 foot vertically for every two feet horizontally.  His elevation increases from 100 feet to 1450 feet.  How far does he move horizontally, in feet?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2700.0\nHe travels 1450-100=1350 feet vertically\nSo he travels 1350*2=2700 feet horizontally\n#### 2700\n(B): 2900.0\nHe reaches an elevation of 1450 feet\nSince he moves 2 feet horizontally for each vertical foot, he travels 1450*2=2900 feet horizontally\n#### 2900\n## Argument in favour of A\nJohn's elevation increases from 100 feet to 1450 feet, which means he climbs 1350 feet vertically. Since he moves 1 foot vertically for every 2 feet horizontally, the horizontal distance is calculated by multiplying the vertical distance by 2. Therefore, 1350 feet vertically * 2 = 2700 feet horizontally. This calculation directly follows the given ratio and the change in elevation, making 2700 feet the correct answer.\n"
