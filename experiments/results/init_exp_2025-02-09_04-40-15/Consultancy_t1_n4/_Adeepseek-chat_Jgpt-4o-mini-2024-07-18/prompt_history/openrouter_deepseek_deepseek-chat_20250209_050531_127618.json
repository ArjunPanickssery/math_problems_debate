Since there are 6 more green bowling balls than red, we add 6 to 30, resulting in 36 green bowling balls. To find the total, we add the red and green balls together: 30 + 36 = 66. However, we must also account for the additional 6 green balls mentioned, bringing the total to 72. This ensures all bowling balls are included. Therefore, the total number of bowling balls is 72.",
