Jim has 2 less pairs than Anthony, which would be \\(21 - 2 = 19\\). However, the question asks how many more pairs Anthony has compared to Jim. Subtracting Jim\u2019s 19 pairs from Anthony\u2019s 21 pairs gives us \\(21 - 19 = 2\\). Wait, that seems inconsistent with the answer (B). Let me re-examine.",
