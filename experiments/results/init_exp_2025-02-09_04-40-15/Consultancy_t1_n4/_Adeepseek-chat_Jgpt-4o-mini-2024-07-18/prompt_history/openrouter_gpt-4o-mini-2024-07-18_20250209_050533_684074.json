      "content": "QUESTION: Maci is planning for the new school year and goes to the store to buy pens. She needs ten blue pens and 15 red pens. If a blue pen costs ten cents each and a red pen costs twice as much as the blue pen, how much money does Maci pay for the pens?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nMaci pays 10 * $0.10 = $1 for the blue pens.\nEach red pen costs 2*$0.10 = $0.20\nShe pays 15*$0.20 = $3.00 for the red pens.\nTo buy all the pens she needs, Maci pays $3+$1= $4\n#### 4\n(A): 3.0\nMaci pays 10 * $0.10 = $1.00 for the blue pens.\nThe red pens should cost twice as much, so that's $1.00 * 2 = $2.00\nTo buy all the pens she needs, Maci pays $2.00 + $1.00 = $3.00\n#### 3\n## Argument in favour of B\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (B) $4.00. Maci buys 10 blue pens at $0.10 each, totaling $1.00. Each red pen costs twice as much as a blue pen, so each red pen is $0.20. For 15 red pens, she pays 15 * $0.20 = $3.00. Adding the cost of blue and red pens together, $1.00 + $3.00 = $4.00. This calculation is precise and aligns with the given information. The alternative answer (A) incorrectly calculates the total cost of red pens by doubling the total cost of blue pens, which is not the correct method. Therefore, Maci pays $4.00.\n"
