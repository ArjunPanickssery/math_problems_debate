      "content": "QUESTION: Maci is planning for the new school year and goes to the store to buy pens. She needs ten blue pens and 15 red pens. If a blue pen costs ten cents each and a red pen costs twice as much as the blue pen, how much money does Maci pay for the pens?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nMaci pays 10 * $0.10 = $1 for the blue pens.\nEach red pen costs 2*$0.10 = $0.20\nShe pays 15*$0.20 = $3.00 for the red pens.\nTo buy all the pens she needs, Maci pays $3+$1= $4\n#### 4\n(A): 3.0\nMaci pays 10 * $0.10 = $1.00 for the blue pens.\nThe red pens should cost twice as much, so that's $1.00 * 2 = $2.00\nTo buy all the pens she needs, Maci pays $2.00 + $1.00 = $3.00\n#### 3\n## Argument in favour of B\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (B) $4.00. Maci buys 10 blue pens at $0.10 each, totaling $1.00. Each red pen costs twice as much as a blue pen, so each red pen is $0.20. For 15 red pens, she pays 15 * $0.20 = $3.00. Adding the cost of blue and red pens together, $1.00 + $3.00 = $4.00. This calculation is precise and aligns with the given information. The alternative answer (A) incorrectly calculates the total cost of red pens by doubling the total cost of blue pens, which is not the correct method. Therefore, Maci pays $4.00.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the cost of one blue pen?  \nWhat is the cost of one red pen?  \nHow many blue pens does Maci need?  \nHow many red pens does Maci need?  \nWhat is the total cost for the blue pens?  \nWhat is the total cost for the red pens?  \nCan you confirm the method used to calculate the total cost for both types of pens?  \nIs there a difference in how the costs are calculated for blue and red pens?  \nWhat is the final total cost when adding both types of pens together?  \nAre there any discounts or additional fees that should be considered in this calculation?  \n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 4.0\nMaci pays 10 * $0.10 = $1 for the blue pens.\nEach red pen costs 2*$0.10 = $0.20\nShe pays 15*$0.20 = $3.00 for the red pens.\nTo buy all the pens she needs, Maci pays $3+$1= $4\n#### 4"

The total cost for blue pens is 10 * $0.10 = $1.00. For red pens, it\u2019s 15 * $0.20 = $3.00. The method used is straightforward multiplication based on the given prices. The costs for blue and red pens are calculated separately, then added together. There are no discounts or fees to consider. Thus, the final total cost is $1.00 + $3.00 = $4.00.",
