Company B sold 350 bottles at $3.5 each, earning $1225. Subtracting Company A's earnings from Company B's gives $25. This straightforward calculation shows Company B made $25 more than Company A. The difference in earnings is based on actual sales, not hypothetical scenarios or price differences per bottle. Therefore, the correct answer is (B): 25.0.",
