          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is 144 hours. The question states that each round trip takes 3 hours, meaning the total time for one trip to town and back is 6 hours. Melissa makes two such trips each month, resulting in 12 hours of driving per month. Over 12 months, this accumulates to 144 hours annually. The alternative answer of 72 hours incorrectly assumes only one trip per month, which contradicts the information provided. Therefore, the accurate calculation supports 144 hours as the correct answer.",
