          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (B) $20,800. Here's why: Jame's new weekly earnings are $20/hour * 40 hours = $800. His old weekly earnings were $16/hour * 25 hours = $400. The difference in weekly earnings is $800 - $400 = $400. To find the annual difference, we multiply the weekly difference by the number of weeks in a year: $400 * 52 = $20,800. This calculation accurately reflects the total additional income Jame earns annually in his new job compared to his old one. The other answer, $8,320, is incorrect because it fails to account for the full difference in both hourly rate and hours worked.",
