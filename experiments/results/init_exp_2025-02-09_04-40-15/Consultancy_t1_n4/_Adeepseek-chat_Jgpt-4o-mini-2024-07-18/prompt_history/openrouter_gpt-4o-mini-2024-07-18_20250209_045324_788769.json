      "content": "QUESTION: James buys 3 CDs.  Two of them are 1.5 hours each.  The last one is twice that long.  What is the combined length of the CDs?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 6.0\nThe long CD is 1.5*2=3 hours\nThe two shorter CDs have a combined length of 1.5*2=3 hours\nSo in total the CDs had a length of 3+3= 6 hours\n#### 6\n(B): 4.5\nThe long CD is 1.5*2=3 hours\nThe short CDs have a length of 1.5 hours\nSo in total the CDs had a length of 3+1.5=4.5 hours\n#### 4.5\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct combined length of the CDs is 6.0 hours. Here\u2019s why: The two shorter CDs are each 1.5 hours, so together they total 3 hours. The third CD is twice as long as one of the shorter ones, which means it is 1.5 * 2 = 3 hours. Adding the lengths of all three CDs together, 3 + 3 = 6 hours. This calculation is straightforward and accurate, confirming that the total length is indeed 6.0 hours.\n"
