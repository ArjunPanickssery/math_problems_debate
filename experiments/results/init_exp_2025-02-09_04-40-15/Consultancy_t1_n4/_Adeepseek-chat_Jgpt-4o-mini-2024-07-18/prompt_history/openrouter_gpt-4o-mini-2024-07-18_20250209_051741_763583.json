      "content": "QUESTION: Lyra bought a pair of shoes at a 20% discount.  If she paid $480, how much was the original price of the pair of shoes?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 600.0\nLyra only paid $480 for the pair of shoes which is only 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.\nSo let x be the original price.\nThen 0.8x = $480\nThus x = $480 / 0.8 = $600\n#### 600\n(A): 576\nThe discount amount is 20% of $480 = $96\nThe original price is $480 + $96 = $576\n#### 576\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe original price calculation in answer (A) is correct because the discount is applied to the final price Lyra paid, not the original price. Since Lyra paid $480 after a 20% discount, the discount amount is 20% of $480, which is $96. Adding this discount back to the amount she paid gives the original price: $480 + $96 = $576. This approach directly uses the information provided and avoids unnecessary assumptions about the original price.\n"
