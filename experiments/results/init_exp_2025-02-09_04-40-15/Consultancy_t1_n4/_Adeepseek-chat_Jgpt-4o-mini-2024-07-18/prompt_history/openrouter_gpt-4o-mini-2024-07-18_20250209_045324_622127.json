      "content": "QUESTION: Winwin won $50 in a lottery. She paid 20% for the tax and she paid $5 for the processing fee. How much was she able to take home?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 35.0\nWinwin paid $50 x 20/100 = $10 for the tax.\nSo, she has $50 - $10 = 40 after paying the tax.\nTherefore, Winwin was able to take home $40 - $5 = $35 after she paid for the processing fee.\n#### 35\n(B): 36.0\nFirst subtract the processing fee: $50 - $5 = $45\nThen calculate 20% tax of $45: $45 x 20/100 = $9\nTherefore, Winwin was able to take home $45 - $9 = $36\n#### 36\n## Argument in favour of B\nYour Honor, the correct sequence of deductions is crucial here. Winwin first pays the $5 processing fee, reducing her initial $50 to $45. The 20% tax is then calculated on this reduced amount, which is $9. Subtracting the tax from the remaining $45 leaves her with $36. This method ensures that the tax is applied to the net amount after the processing fee, not the original sum. Therefore, Winwin takes home $36, making answer (B) the accurate and logical choice.\n"
