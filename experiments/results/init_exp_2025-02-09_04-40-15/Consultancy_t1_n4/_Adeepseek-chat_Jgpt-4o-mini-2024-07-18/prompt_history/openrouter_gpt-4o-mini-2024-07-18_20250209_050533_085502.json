      "content": "QUESTION: My dog was born when I was 15 years old. Two years from now, my dog will turn 4 years old. How old am I now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 17.0\nIn 2 years, my dog will be 4 years old, so my dog is 4 - 2 = 2 years old now.\nSo I am 15 + 2 = 17 years old now.\n#### 17\n(B): 19.0\nI was 15 when my dog was born. My dog will be 4 years old in 2 years.\nSo my current age is 15 + 4 = 19 years old.\n#### 19\n## Argument in favour of B\nYour dog will be 4 years old in 2 years, meaning it is currently 2 years old. Since you were 15 when the dog was born, you are now 15 + 2 = 17 years old. However, the question asks for your age now, not in 2 years. Therefore, the correct answer is 17, not 19. The calculation in option (B) incorrectly adds the dog's future age to your age at the dog's birth, leading to an erroneous conclusion. The accurate calculation is 15 + 2 = 17. Thus, the correct answer is (A): 17.0.\n"
