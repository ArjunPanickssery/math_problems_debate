      "content": "QUESTION: A long wire is cut into three smaller pieces in the ratio of 7:3:2. If the shortest piece is 16 cm, how long was the entire wire before it was cut?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 96.0\nSince the shortest part is consists of 2 parts, then each part is equal to 16 cm/2 = 8 cm.\nThe whole wire was cut into 7 + 3 + 2 = 12 parts.\nHence, the wire was 8 cm x 12 = 96 cm long\n#### 96\n(B): 64\nIf we take the middle piece (ratio 3) as 16 cm, then each unit length is 16 \u00f7 3 = 5.33... cm\nFor ratio 7: 7 \u00d7 5.33... = 37.33... cm\nFor ratio 3: 16 cm\nFor ratio 2: 2 \u00d7 5.33... = 10.67... cm\nTotal length = 37.33... + 16 + 10.67... = 64 cm\n#### 64\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe shortest piece corresponds to the ratio 2, and its length is given as 16 cm. This means each part of the ratio equals 16 cm \u00f7 2 = 8 cm. The total ratio parts are 7 + 3 + 2 = 12. Therefore, the entire wire\u2019s length is 8 cm \u00d7 12 = 96 cm. This calculation is straightforward and aligns with the given ratio and the length of the shortest piece, making 96 cm the correct answer.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total ratio of the pieces when combined?  \nHow many total parts are represented in the ratio 7:3:2?  \nIf the shortest piece corresponds to the ratio of 2, how does that relate to the length of the other pieces?  \nCan you confirm the relationship between the shortest piece and the total length of the wire based on the given ratio?  \nWhat would be the length of each part if the shortest piece is indeed 16 cm?  \nIs there any alternative method to calculate the total length of the wire using the given ratios?  \nHow does the length of the middle piece relate to the other pieces in terms of the ratio?  \nCould the assumption that the shortest piece is the one corresponding to the ratio of 2 be incorrect?  \nWhat is the calculation for the total length if we assume the middle piece corresponds to the ratio of 3 instead?  \nIs there any possibility that the total length could be less than 96 cm based on the ratios provided?\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe total ratio of the pieces combined is 7:3:2, which sums to 12 parts. The shortest piece corresponds to the ratio of 2, and its length is 16 cm. Therefore, each part of the ratio equals 16 cm \u00f7 2 = 8 cm. The total length of the wire is calculated by multiplying the value of each part (8 cm) by the total number of parts (12), resulting in 96 cm. This method is consistent and directly uses the given ratio and the length of the shortest piece, confirming that the total length is indeed 96 cm.\n"
