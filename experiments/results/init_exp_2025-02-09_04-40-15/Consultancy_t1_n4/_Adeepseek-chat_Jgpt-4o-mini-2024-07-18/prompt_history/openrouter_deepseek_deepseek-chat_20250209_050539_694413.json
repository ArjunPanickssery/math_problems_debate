          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (B): 10.0. The calculation is straightforward: Laura bought 2 pairs of pants at $54 each, totaling $108, and 4 shirts at $33 each, totaling $132. Adding these amounts gives a total of $240. Since Laura gave $250 to the cashier, the change she received is $250 minus $240, which equals $10. This is a clear and accurate calculation based on the given prices and quantities. There is no ambiguity in this arithmetic, and the answer logically follows from the provided information.",
