      "content": "QUESTION: Isabel has some money in her piggy bank. She spent half the amount and bought a toy. She then spent half of the remaining money and bought her brother a book. If she has $51 left, how much money, in dollars, did she have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 204.0\nAfter buying the toy, Isabel has 51*2=102 dollars left.\nIsabel had 102*2=204 dollars at first.\n#### 204\n(A): 408.0\nWorking backwards from what's left:\n51 * 2 = 102 is the previous amount\n102 * 2 = 204 is the amount before that\n204 * 2 = 408 was the initial amount\n#### 408\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo determine Isabel's initial amount, let's work step by step. After buying the book, she has $51 left, which was half of her previous amount. So, before buying the book, she had 51 * 2 = 102 dollars. This $102 was what remained after she bought the toy, which cost half of her initial amount. Therefore, her initial amount was 102 * 2 = 204 dollars. This straightforward calculation confirms that Isabel started with $204.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow did Isabel spend the money on the toy and the book? Can you clarify the sequence of her spending? \n\nIs there any additional information about the costs of the toy and the book? \n\nWhat is the logic behind the calculations for the initial amount? \n\nAre both answers (204 and 408) based on the same reasoning or different methods? \n\nCan you confirm if the final amount of $51 is accurate after both purchases? \n\nIs there a specific formula or method that should be applied to solve this type of problem? \n\nHow confident are you in the calculations leading to each possible answer? \n\nIs there a common mistake people make when solving similar problems?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 204.0\nAfter buying the toy, Isabel has 51*2=102 dollars left.\nIsabel had 102*2=204 dollars at first.\n#### 204"

This means the $51 is half of what she had before buying the book, so she had 51 * 2 = 102 dollars before the book purchase. Since $102 was half of her initial amount after buying the toy, her initial amount was 102 * 2 = 204 dollars.
