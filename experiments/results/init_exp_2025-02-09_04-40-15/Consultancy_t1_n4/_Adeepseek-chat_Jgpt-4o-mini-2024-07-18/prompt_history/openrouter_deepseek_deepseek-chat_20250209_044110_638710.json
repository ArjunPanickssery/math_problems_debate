Gary has 5 times the combined number of Darla and Katie\u2019s books, so 5 * (6 + 3) = 45 books. Adding them together, 6 + 3 + 45 = 54 books. However, the question states that Katie has half as many books as Darla, which is 6 / 2 = 3 books, not 12. Therefore, the correct total is 54, not 108. The answer (B) is incorrect.",
