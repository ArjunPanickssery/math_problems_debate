      "content": "QUESTION: Sami finds 3 spiders in the playground.  Hunter sees 12 ants climbing the wall.  Ming discovers 8 ladybugs in the sandbox, and watches 2 of them fly away. How many insects are remaining in the playground?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 21.0\nThe children find 3 + 12 + 8 = 23 insects.\nAfter the ladybugs fly away, there are 23 - 2 = 21 insects.\n#### 21\n(A): 18.0\nLet's count the remaining insects:\nAnts remain constant at 12\nFor ladybugs, start with 8 and subtract 2 that flew = 6 ladybugs\nSpiders are not counted in our insect total\nSo total insects = 12 + 6 = 18\n#### 18\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct answer is (A): 18.0. Spiders are not insects; they belong to the arachnid class. Therefore, the 3 spiders should not be included in the insect count. The ants and ladybugs are the only insects here. Starting with 12 ants and 8 ladybugs, we subtract the 2 ladybugs that flew away, leaving us with 12 ants and 6 ladybugs. Adding these together gives a total of 18 insects remaining in the playground. This distinction between insects and arachnids is crucial for accurate counting.\n"
