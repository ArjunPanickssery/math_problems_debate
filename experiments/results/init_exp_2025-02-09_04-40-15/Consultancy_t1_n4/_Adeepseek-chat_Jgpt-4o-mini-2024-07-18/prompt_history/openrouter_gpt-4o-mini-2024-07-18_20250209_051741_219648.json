      "content": "QUESTION: Sam shared a sum of money between his three cousins Sandra, Amy and Ruth in the ratio 2:1:3 respectively. If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100\n(B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe ratio 2:1:3 clearly indicates that Sandra receives twice as much as Amy. Since Amy received $50, Sandra's share is directly calculated by multiplying Amy's amount by 2. This straightforward application of the ratio ensures accuracy. Therefore, Sandra received $100. This method aligns with the given ratio and ensures consistency in the distribution of the sum.\n"
