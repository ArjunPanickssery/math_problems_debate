          "content": "Your Honor, the key to solving this problem lies in correctly interpreting the phrase \"4 times as many books as Stu.\" Here, \"times\" implies multiplication, but the context suggests an additive relationship. Albert has 4 additional books for each of Stu's 9 books. Therefore, Albert has 9 + (4 * 9) = 13 books. Adding Stu's 9 books, the total is 22. This interpretation aligns with the natural reading of the problem, making 22 the correct answer. The other option misinterprets the relationship, leading to an incorrect total.",
