      "content": "QUESTION: There are 4,000 jelly beans in a jar. If three fourths of the jelly beans are red, and one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, how many jelly beans are coconut flavored?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 750.0\nThere are 4000/4*3=3000 red jelly beans.\nThere are 3000/4=750 coconut flavored jelly beans.\n#### 750\n(A): 1000.0\nFirst find one quarter of all jelly beans: 4000/4 = 1000\nSince these coconut ones must be among the red ones, and three fourths are red, \nthe coconut flavored ones are: 1000\n#### 1000\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo determine the number of coconut-flavored jelly beans, we must follow the problem's logical sequence. First, calculate the total number of red jelly beans: \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 4000 = 3000 \\). Next, since one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, we compute \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 3000 = 750 \\). This step-by-step approach ensures accuracy by first isolating the red jelly beans and then identifying the subset that is coconut flavored. Thus, the correct number of coconut-flavored jelly beans is 750.\n"
