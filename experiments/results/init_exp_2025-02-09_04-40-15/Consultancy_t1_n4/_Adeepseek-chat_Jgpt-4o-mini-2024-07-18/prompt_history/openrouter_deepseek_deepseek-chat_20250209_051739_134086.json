          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (B): 17.0 feet. The calculation is straightforward: John's initial height is 66 inches, and he grows 2 inches per month for 3 months. To find the total change in height, we add his initial height to the growth per month and then multiply by the number of months: (66 + 2) * 3 = 204 inches. Converting inches to feet by dividing by 12 gives us 204 / 12 = 17 feet. This method ensures accuracy in determining John's final height.",
