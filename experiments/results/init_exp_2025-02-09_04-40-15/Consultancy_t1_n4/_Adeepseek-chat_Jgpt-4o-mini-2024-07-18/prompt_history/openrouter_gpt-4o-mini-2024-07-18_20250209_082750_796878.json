      "content": "QUESTION: Maddy is in college for 8 semesters. She needs 120 credits to graduate. If each class is 3 credits, how many classes does she need to take per semester?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 5.0\n120 credits / 3 credits is 40.\n40 credits/ 8 semester = 5 classes per semester.\nMaddy needs to take 5 classes per semester\n#### 5\n(B): 15\nStarting with 120 total credits required\nDividing by 8 semesters gives us 15 credits per semester\nConverting to classes by dividing these semester credits by 3 credits per class\nThis means 15 classes per semester are needed\n#### 15\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, the calculation is straightforward and logical. Maddy needs 120 credits to graduate, and each class is worth 3 credits. Dividing 120 by 3 gives us 40 classes in total. Since she has 8 semesters, we divide 40 classes by 8 semesters, resulting in 5 classes per semester. This method ensures Maddy meets her graduation requirements efficiently. The alternative answer of 15 classes per semester is impractical and mathematically incorrect, as it would require her to take an excessive and unmanageable number of classes. Therefore, the correct answer is 5 classes per semester.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total number of credits Maddy needs to graduate?  \nHow many credits does each class provide?  \nHow many semesters is Maddy enrolled in?  \nWhat is the total number of classes required to meet the credit requirement?  \nHow do you calculate the number of classes Maddy needs to take each semester?  \nIs it common for college students to take 15 classes in a semester?  \nWhat is the maximum number of classes a student typically takes in a semester?  \nCan you confirm the calculations for both options A and B?  \nWhat are the implications of taking too many classes in a semester?  \nIs there a standard formula for determining class load based on credits and semesters?  \n\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, Maddy needs a total of 120 credits to graduate, with each class providing 3 credits. She is enrolled in 8 semesters. Dividing 120 credits by 3 credits per class gives us 40 classes in total. To find the number of classes per semester, we divide 40 classes by 8 semesters, resulting in 5 classes per semester. Taking 15 classes in a semester is highly uncommon and impractical, as most students typically take 4-6 classes per semester. The calculations for option A are accurate, while option B\u2019s method leads to an unrealistic and unmanageable class load.\n"
