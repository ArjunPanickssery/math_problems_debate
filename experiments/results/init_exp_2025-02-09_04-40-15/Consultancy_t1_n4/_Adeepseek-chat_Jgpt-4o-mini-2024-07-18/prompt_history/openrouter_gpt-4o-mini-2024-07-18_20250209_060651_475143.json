      "content": "QUESTION: Mr. Ha owns 5 more silver dollars than Mr. Phung. Mr. Phung has 16 more silver dollars than Mr. Chiu has. If Mr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars, how many silver dollars the three have in total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 205.0\nMr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars.\nIf Mr. Phung has 16 more silver dollars than Mr. Chiu, then his total silver dollars is 56+16 = 72\nThe total number of silver dollars that Mr. Ha owns is 72 +5= 77\nCombined, together they have 77+72+56 = 205 silver dollars\n#### 205\n(B): 189.0\nMr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars.\nMr. Phung has 16 more silver dollars than Mr. Chiu, so he has 56+16 = 72 silver dollars\nMr. Ha has 5 more silver dollars, so his total is 56+5 = 61 silver dollars\nTogether they have 72+61+56 = 189 silver dollars\n#### 189\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (A) 205.0. Let\u2019s break it down step by step. Mr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars. Mr. Phung has 16 more than Mr. Chiu, so he has 56 + 16 = 72. Mr. Ha has 5 more than Mr. Phung, so he has 72 + 5 = 77. Adding these together, 56 (Chiu) + 72 (Phung) + 77 (Ha) = 205. The math is clear and consistent, leading us to the total of 205 silver dollars. This aligns perfectly with the information provided in the question.\n"
