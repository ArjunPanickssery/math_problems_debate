      "content": "QUESTION: Sam has 18 cows.  5 more than half the cows are black.  How many cows are not black?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 4.0\nHalf of the cows: 18/2=9\nBlack cows: 5+9=14\n18-14=4 cows\n#### 4\n(B): 6\nTotal cows plus 5: 18+5 = 23\nHalf of 23 (rounded): 12\nThese are black cows\nNon-black cows: 18-12 = 6\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct interpretation of the problem is that 5 more than half of the cows are black. Half of 18 cows is 9. Adding 5 to this gives 14 black cows. Subtracting the black cows from the total, 18 - 14, leaves 4 cows that are not black. This straightforward calculation aligns with the problem's wording and leads to the answer (A): 4.0. The other approach misinterprets the problem by adding 5 to the total cows first, which is not what the question states. Therefore, (A) is the accurate answer.\n"
