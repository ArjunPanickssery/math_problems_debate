          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (A) 205.0. Let\u2019s break it down step by step. Mr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars. Mr. Phung has 16 more than Mr. Chiu, so he has 56 + 16 = 72. Mr. Ha has 5 more than Mr. Phung, so he has 72 + 5 = 77. Adding these together, 56 (Chiu) + 72 (Phung) + 77 (Ha) = 205. The math is clear and consistent, leading us to the total of 205 silver dollars. This aligns perfectly with the information provided in the question.",
