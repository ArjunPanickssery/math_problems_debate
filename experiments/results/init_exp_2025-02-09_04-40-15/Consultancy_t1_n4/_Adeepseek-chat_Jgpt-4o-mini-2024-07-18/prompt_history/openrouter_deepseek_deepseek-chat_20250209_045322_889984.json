Peter read 40% of 20 books, which is 8 books. His brother read 10% of the same 20 books, which is 2 books. The difference between them is 8 - 2 = 6 books. There is no need to scale this difference by the total number of books, as the question simply asks for the numerical difference. Therefore, the answer is clearly 6.",
