      "content": "QUESTION: A farm has 5 less than 9 times the amount of hens as roosters.  If there are 75 total chickens, how many hens are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 67.0\nLet x represent the number of roosters\nNumber of hens:9x-5\nTotal:9x-5+x=75\n10x-5=75\n10x=80\nx=8\nNumber of hens: 9(8)-5=67\n#### 67\n(B): 68.0\nLet x represent the number of roosters\nNumber of hens: 9x+5\nTotal: 9x+5+x=75\n10x+5=75\n10x=70\nx=7\nNumber of hens: 9(7)+5=68\n#### 68\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (A): 67.0. The problem states that the farm has \"5 less than 9 times the amount of hens as roosters,\" which translates to the equation for hens as \\(9x - 5\\). When we set up the total equation \\(9x - 5 + x = 75\\), we solve for \\(x\\) and find \\(x = 8\\). Substituting back, the number of hens is \\(9(8) - 5 = 67\\). This aligns perfectly with the given conditions and the total number of chickens. Therefore, the answer is unequivocally 67.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the correct interpretation of the phrase \"5 less than 9 times the amount of hens as roosters\"? \n\nDoes the total number of chickens include both hens and roosters, and how is that represented mathematically? \n\nCan you clarify how to set up the equation based on the relationship between the number of hens and roosters? \n\nIs there a specific method to verify the calculations for both possible answers? \n\nWhat would be the implications of assuming the wrong relationship between hens and roosters? \n\nAre there any common mistakes made in similar problems that I should be aware of? \n\nHow can I ensure that the total of 75 is accurately represented in the equations? \n\nWhat is the best way to confirm which answer aligns with the problem's conditions?\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, the phrase \"5 less than 9 times the amount of hens as roosters\" means the number of hens is calculated by taking 9 times the number of roosters and then subtracting 5. Mathematically, this is represented as \\( \\text{Hens} = 9x - 5 \\), where \\( x \\) is the number of roosters. The total number of chickens includes both hens and roosters, so the equation becomes \\( 9x - 5 + x = 75 \\). Solving this, we find \\( x = 8 \\), and substituting back gives \\( 9(8) - 5 = 67 \\) hens. To verify, ensure the total \\( 67 + 8 = 75 \\) matches the problem's condition. Common mistakes include misinterpreting the relationship or miscalculating the total. Always double-check the equation setup and calculations to confirm accuracy.\n"
