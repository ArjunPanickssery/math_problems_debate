          "content": "Your Honor, the calculation in answer (B) is correct because it accurately reflects the total cost based on the time James spends painting. The mural area is 300 square feet, and at 20 minutes per square foot, it takes 6000 minutes. Since James charges $150 per hour, multiplying 6000 minutes by $150 gives $900,000. This ensures that every minute of his labor is accounted for, aligning with his hourly rate. The other answer incorrectly converts minutes to hours, leading to an undervaluation of his work. Thus, $900,000 is the appropriate charge.",
