      "content": "QUESTION: Jack buys a squat rack for $2500.  The barbell cost 1/10 as much.  How much did he pay for everything?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2750.0\nThe barbell cost 2500/10=$250\nSo he paid 2500+250=$2750 for everything\n#### 2750\n(B): 2250\nThe squat rack costs $2500\nFor the barbell at 1/10 the price: 2500/10 = 250\nApplying this difference to the total: 2500 - 250 = 2250\n#### 2250\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, the correct total amount Jack paid is $2750. The squat rack costs $2500, and the barbell costs 1/10 of that, which is $250. To find the total cost, we simply add the two amounts together: $2500 + $250 = $2750. This straightforward calculation clearly shows that Jack paid $2750 for everything. The other option, $2250, incorrectly subtracts the cost of the barbell from the squat rack, which does not make sense in this context. Therefore, the accurate and logical answer is $2750.\n"
