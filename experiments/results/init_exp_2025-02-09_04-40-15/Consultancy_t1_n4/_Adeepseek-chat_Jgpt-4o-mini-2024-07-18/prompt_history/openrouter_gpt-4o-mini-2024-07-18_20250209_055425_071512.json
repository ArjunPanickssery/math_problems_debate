      "content": "QUESTION: Terese thinks that running various distances throughout the week can make one healthy.  On Monday, she runs 4.2 miles;  Tuesday, 3.8 miles; Wednesday, 3.6 miles; and on Thursday, 4.4 miles.  Determine the average distance Terese runs on each of the days she runs.\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 4.0\nThe total distance Terese runs is 4.2 + 3.8+4.4 +3.6 = 16 miles.\nTherefore, she runs with an average distance of 16 /4 = 4 miles.\n#### 4\n(B): 2.29\nThe total distance Terese runs is 4.2 + 3.8 + 3.6 + 4.4 = 16 miles.\nTherefore, her average distance is 16 / 7 = 2.29 miles.\n#### 2.29\n## Argument in favour of A\nTo determine the average distance Terese runs each day, we calculate the total distance she runs over the four days and then divide by the number of days. Terese runs 4.2 miles on Monday, 3.8 miles on Tuesday, 3.6 miles on Wednesday, and 4.4 miles on Thursday. Adding these distances gives a total of 16 miles. Dividing this total by the four days she runs results in an average of 4 miles per day. This method accurately reflects her daily running distance, making the correct answer 4.0.\n"
