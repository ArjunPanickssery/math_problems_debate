      "content": "QUESTION: Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. If Mabel has 85 marbles, how many more marbles does Mabel have than Amanda?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 63.0\nKatrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles.\nTwice as many marbles as Katrina is 17 x 2 = 34\nAmanda has 34 -12 = 22 marbles.\nMabel has 85 - 22 = 63 more marbles than Amanda\n#### 63\n(B): 39.0\nKatrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles\nAmanda will have 17 \u00d7 2 + 12 = 46 marbles\nMabel has 85 - 46 = 39 more marbles than Amanda\n#### 39\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is (B): 39.0. Here's why: First, Katrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles. Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many as Katrina, so Amanda has (17 \u00d7 2) + 12 = 46 marbles. Mabel has 85 marbles, so the difference between Mabel and Amanda is 85 - 46 = 39. This calculation aligns perfectly with the problem's conditions, making (B) the accurate answer.\n"
