      "content": "QUESTION: Mr. Sanchez found out that 40% of his Grade 5  students got a final grade below B. How many of his students got a final grade of B and above if he has 60 students in Grade 5?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 36.0\nSince 40% of his students got below B, 100% - 40% = 60% of Mr. Sanchez's students got B and above.\nThus, 60 x 60/100 = 36 students got B and above in their final grade.\n#### 36\n(B): 24.0\n40% of Mr. Sanchez's students are relevant to our calculation of B and above grades.\nTherefore, 60 \u00d7 40/100 = 24 students got B and above in their final grade.\n#### 24\n## Argument in favour of A\nYour Honor, the correct answer is (A): 36.0. The reasoning is straightforward: if 40% of Mr. Sanchez's students scored below a B, then the remaining 60% must have achieved a B or higher. To find the number of students, we calculate 60% of the total 60 students. This is done by multiplying 60 by 0.60, which equals 36. Therefore, 36 students received a final grade of B and above. This method ensures accuracy by directly addressing the percentage of students who met the grade threshold.\n"
