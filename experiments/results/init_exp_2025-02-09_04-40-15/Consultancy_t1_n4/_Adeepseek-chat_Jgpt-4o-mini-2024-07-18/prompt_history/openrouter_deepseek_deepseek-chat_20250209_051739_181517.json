          "content": "The correct answer is (B) 22.0. Let\u2019s break it down step by step. Tim starts with x cans. Jeff takes 6, leaving Tim with x - 6 cans. Tim then buys half of what he has left, which is (x - 6)/2. Adding these together gives x - 6 + (x - 6)/2 = 24. Simplifying, we get 2x - 12 + x - 6 = 48, leading to 3x - 18 = 48. Solving for x, we find x = 22. This logical progression clearly supports the answer 22.0.",
