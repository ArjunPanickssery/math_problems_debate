      "content": "QUESTION: A long wire is cut into three smaller pieces in the ratio of 7:3:2. If the shortest piece is 16 cm, how long was the entire wire before it was cut?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 96.0\nSince the shortest part is consists of 2 parts, then each part is equal to 16 cm/2 = 8 cm.\nThe whole wire was cut into 7 + 3 + 2 = 12 parts.\nHence, the wire was 8 cm x 12 = 96 cm long\n#### 96\n(B): 64\nIf we take the middle piece (ratio 3) as 16 cm, then each unit length is 16 \u00f7 3 = 5.33... cm\nFor ratio 7: 7 \u00d7 5.33... = 37.33... cm\nFor ratio 3: 16 cm\nFor ratio 2: 2 \u00d7 5.33... = 10.67... cm\nTotal length = 37.33... + 16 + 10.67... = 64 cm\n#### 64\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe key to solving this problem lies in correctly interpreting the ratio and the given information. The ratio 7:3:2 indicates the proportional lengths of the three pieces. The problem states that the shortest piece is 16 cm, which corresponds to the ratio 2. However, if we consider the middle piece (ratio 3) as 16 cm, we can determine the unit length as 16 \u00f7 3 \u2248 5.33 cm. Applying this unit length to the other ratios, we get 7 \u00d7 5.33 \u2248 37.33 cm and 2 \u00d7 5.33 \u2248 10.67 cm. Adding these together, the total length is 37.33 + 16 + 10.67 = 64 cm. This approach ensures consistency with the given ratio and the provided information, leading to the correct answer of 64 cm.\n"
