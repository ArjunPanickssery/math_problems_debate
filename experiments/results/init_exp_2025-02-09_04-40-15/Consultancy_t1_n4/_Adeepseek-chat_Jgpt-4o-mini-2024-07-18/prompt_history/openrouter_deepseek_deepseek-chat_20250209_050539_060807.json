How many more centimeters did it rain on Tuesdays than Mondays?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 12.0\nMondays: 7 * 1.5 = 10.5\nTuesdays: 9 * 2.5 = 22.5\n22.5 - 10.5 = 12 cm\nIt rained 12 centimeters more on Tuesdays than on Mondays.\n#### 12\n(B): 9.0\nLet's find the difference per day: 2.5 - 1.5 = 1\nSince there were 9 Tuesdays, multiply by 9\n1 * 9 = 9\nTherefore, it rained 9 centimeters more on Tuesdays than Mondays.\n#### 9\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 12.0\nMondays: 7 * 1.5 = 10.5\nTuesdays: 9 * 2.5 = 22.5\n22.5 - 10.5 = 12 cm\nIt rained 12 centimeters more on Tuesdays than on Mondays.\n#### 12"

          "content": "Your Honor, the correct answer is (A) 12.0. Here\u2019s why: First, we calculate the total rainfall on Mondays by multiplying the number of Mondays (7) by the rainfall per Monday (1.5 cm), resulting in 10.5 cm. Next, we calculate the total rainfall on Tuesdays by multiplying the number of Tuesdays (9) by the rainfall per Tuesday (2.5 cm), resulting in 22.5 cm. Finally, we subtract the total rainfall on Mondays from the total rainfall on Tuesdays: 22.5 cm - 10.5 cm = 12 cm. This clearly shows that it rained 12 centimeters more on Tuesdays than on Mondays.",
