      "content": "QUESTION: Maria bought a ticket to a ZOO. The regular price stands at $15, but she was able to get a 40% discount. How much did Maria pay for the ticket?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 9.0\nThe discount Maria got was 40/100 * 15 = $6.\nThat means the price for her ticket was 15 - 6 = $9.\n#### 9\n(B): 6.0\nA 40% discount means the price is 40/100 of the original amount.\n40/100 * 15 = $6\n#### 6\n## Argument in favour of A\nMaria\u2019s ticket originally cost $15. A 40% discount means she saved 40% of $15, which is $6. To find the final price, subtract the discount from the original price: $15 - $6 = $9. This calculation clearly shows that Maria paid $9 for her ticket. The logic is straightforward: discounts reduce the original price, not replace it entirely. Therefore, the correct answer is (A): 9.0. This aligns with standard pricing practices and ensures the math is accurate.\n"
