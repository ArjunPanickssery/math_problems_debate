      "content": "QUESTION: A farm has 5 less than 9 times the amount of hens as roosters.  If there are 75 total chickens, how many hens are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 67.0\nLet x represent the number of roosters\nNumber of hens:9x-5\nTotal:9x-5+x=75\n10x-5=75\n10x=80\nx=8\nNumber of hens: 9(8)-5=67\n#### 67\n(B): 68.0\nLet x represent the number of roosters\nNumber of hens: 9x+5\nTotal: 9x+5+x=75\n10x+5=75\n10x=70\nx=7\nNumber of hens: 9(7)+5=68\n#### 68\n## Argument in favour of A\nI will argue in favor of Answer (A): 67.0. Let me break down the solution systematically:\n\nFirst, let's verify the algebraic steps. I'll use math_eval to confirm key calculations:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"9*8-5\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"9*8-5\"},\n    \"result\": 67,\n}\n</tool_result>\nI will argue in favor of Answer (A): 67.0. Let me break down the solution systematically:\n\nFirst, let's verify the algebraic steps. I'll use math_eval to confirm key calculations:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"9*8-5\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"9*8-5\"},\n    \"result\": 67,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe solution demonstrates clear mathematical reasoning. By letting x represent roosters, we establish the relationship that hens are 9x-5. When we solve the equation 9x-5+x=75, we find x=8 roosters. This means 9(8)-5 equals 67 hens, perfectly satisfying the problem's conditions.\n\nThe key strength of this solution is its precise algebraic manipulation and consistent logic. The calculation shows 67 hens, which matches the total chicken count requirement.\n"
