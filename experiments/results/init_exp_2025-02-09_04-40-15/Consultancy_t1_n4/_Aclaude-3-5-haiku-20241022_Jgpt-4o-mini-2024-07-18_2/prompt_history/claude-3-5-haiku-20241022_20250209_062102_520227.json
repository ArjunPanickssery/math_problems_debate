How many strings does he need?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 72.0\nThe basses take 3*4=12 strings\nHe restrings 2*3=6 normal guitars\nThat takes 6*6=36 strings\nHe restrings 6-3=3 guitars with 8 strings\nSo that uses 3*8=24 strings\nSo he uses 12+36+24=72 strings\n#### 72\n(B): 96.0\nThe basses take 3*4=12 strings\nHe restrings 2*3=6 normal guitars\nThat takes 6*6=36 strings\nFor 8-string guitars, we need 6 guitars\nSo that uses 6*8=48 strings\nSo he uses 12+36+48=96 strings\n#### 96\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 96.0\nThe basses take 3*4=12 strings\nHe restrings 2*3=6 normal guitars\nThat takes 6*6=36 strings\nFor 8-string guitars, we need 6 guitars\nSo that uses 6*8=48 strings\nSo he uses 12+36+48=96 strings\n#### 96"
