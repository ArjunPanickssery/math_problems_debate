      "content": "QUESTION: Two companies A and B, are selling bottled milk. Company A sells a big bottle for $4 and Company B sells a big bottle for $3.5. Company A was able to sell 300 and company B 350 big bottles of milk. How much more money did one company make from the other?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 25.0\nCompany A earned 300 * 4 = $1200 for big bottles of milk.\nCompany B earned 350 * 3.5 = $1225 for big bottles of milk.\nCompany B earned 1225 - 1200 = $25 more than company A.\n#### 25\n(A): 325.0\nCompany A sells at $4 and Company B at $3.5, a difference of $0.5 per bottle.\nTotal bottles sold were 300 + 350 = 650 bottles.\nThe difference in earnings was 0.5 * 650 = $325.\n#### 325\n## Argument in favour of B\nI'll help argue for answer (B): 25.0. Let me break this down systematically using the math evaluation tool to verify the calculations.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Company A's earnings:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"300 * 4\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"300 * 4\"},\n    \"result\": 1200,\n}\n</tool_result>\nI'll help argue for answer (B): 25.0.

The calculation is simple: Company A sold 300 bottles at $4 each, totaling $1200, while Company B sold 350 bottles at $3.5 each, totaling $1225. The $25 difference represents the additional earnings of Company B.\n\nThis confirms that Company B earned exactly $25 more than Company A.
