      "content": "QUESTION: A long wire is cut into three smaller pieces in the ratio of 7:3:2. If the shortest piece is 16 cm, how long was the entire wire before it was cut?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 96.0\nSince the shortest part is consists of 2 parts, then each part is equal to 16 cm/2 = 8 cm.\nThe whole wire was cut into 7 + 3 + 2 = 12 parts.\nHence, the wire was 8 cm x 12 = 96 cm long\n#### 96\n(B): 64\nIf we take the middle piece (ratio 3) as 16 cm, then each unit length is 16 \u00f7 3 = 5.33... cm\nFor ratio 7: 7 \u00d7 5.33... = 37.33... cm\nFor ratio 3: 16 cm\nFor ratio 2: 2 \u00d7 5.33... = 10.67... cm\nTotal length = 37.33... + 16 + 10.67... = 64 cm\n#### 64\n## Argument in favour of A\nI'll help you argue for Answer (A): 96.0. Let me break down the reasoning step by step.\n\nFirst, let's verify the key calculations. The shortest piece is 16 cm, and it represents 2 parts in the ratio. So, each part's length is:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"16 / 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"16 / 2\"},\n    \"result\": 8.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nI'll help you argue for Answer (A): 96.0. Let me break down the reasoning step by step.\n\nFirst, let's verify the key calculations. The shortest piece is 16 cm, and it represents 2 parts in the ratio. So, each part's length is:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"16 / 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"16 / 2\"},\n    \"result\": 8.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nNow, let's calculate the total number of parts in the wire:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"7 + 3 + 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"7 + 3 + 2\"},\n    \"result\": 12,\n}\n</tool_result>\nNow, let's calculate the total number of parts in the wire:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"7 + 3 + 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"7 + 3 + 2\"},\n    \"result\": 12,\n}\n</tool_result>\nFinally, we multiply the length of each part by the total number of parts:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"8 * 12\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"8 * 12\"},\n    \"result\": 96,\n}\n</tool_result>\nFinally, we multiply the length of each part by the total number of parts:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"8 * 12\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"8 * 12\"},\n    \"result\": 96,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThis confirms that the entire wire was 96 cm long before being cut. The systematic approach of breaking down the ratio, calculating the part length, and then multiplying by total parts provides a clear and logical solution.\n"
