On Monday, she runs 4.2 miles;  Tuesday, 3.8 miles; Wednesday, 3.6 miles; and on Thursday, 4.4 miles.  Determine the average distance Terese runs on each of the days she runs.\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 4.0\nThe total distance Terese runs is 4.2 + 3.8+4.4 +3.6 = 16 miles.\nTherefore, she runs with an average distance of 16 /4 = 4 miles.\n#### 4\n(B): 2.29\nThe total distance Terese runs is 4.2 + 3.8 + 3.6 + 4.4 = 16 miles.\nTherefore, her average distance is 16 / 7 = 2.29 miles.\n#### 2.29\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 2.29\nThe total distance Terese runs is 4.2 + 3.8 + 3.6 + 4.4 = 16 miles.\nTherefore, her average distance is 16 / 7 = 2.29 miles.\n#### 2.29"
