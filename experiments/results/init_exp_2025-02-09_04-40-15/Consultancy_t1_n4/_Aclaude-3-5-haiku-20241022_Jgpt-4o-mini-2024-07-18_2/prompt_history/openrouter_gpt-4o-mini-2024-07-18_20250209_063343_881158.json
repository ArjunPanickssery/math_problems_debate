      "content": "QUESTION: Ali and Sara ate 80 small apples combined. Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara. How many apples did Sara eat?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 16.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: A = 4S\nWhich means: 4S + S = 80\nSo: 5S = 80\nSo the number of apples Sara ate is: S = 80 / 5= 16 apples\n#### 16\n(A): 64.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: S = 4A\nWhich means: A + 4A = 80\nSo: 5A = 80\nTherefore: A = 16\nAnd finally: S = 4A = 4 \u00d7 16 = 64 apples\n#### 64\n## Argument in favour of B\nI will demonstrate why the answer (B): 16.0 is correct by breaking down the algebraic solution and verifying the calculations.\n\nLet me verify the key steps using the math_eval tool:\n\n1. Total apples equation: A + S = 80\n2. Relationship between Ali and Sara's apples: A = 4S<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4*16 + 16\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4*16 + 16\"},\n    \"result\": 80,\n}\n</tool_result>\nI will demonstrate why the answer (B): 16.0 is correct by breaking down the algebraic solution and verifying the calculations.\n\nLet me verify the key steps using the math_eval tool:\n\n1.

The algebraic manipulation of 4S + S = 80, which simplifies to 5S = 80, leads to S = 16, proving the solution is mathematically sound.\n"
