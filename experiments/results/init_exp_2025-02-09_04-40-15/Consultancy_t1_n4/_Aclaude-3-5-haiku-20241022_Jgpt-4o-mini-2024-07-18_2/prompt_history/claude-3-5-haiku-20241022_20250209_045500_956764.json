If the shortest piece is 16 cm, how long was the entire wire before it was cut?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 96.0\nSince the shortest part is consists of 2 parts, then each part is equal to 16 cm/2 = 8 cm.\nThe whole wire was cut into 7 + 3 + 2 = 12 parts.\nHence, the wire was 8 cm x 12 = 96 cm long\n#### 96\n(B): 64\nIf we take the middle piece (ratio 3) as 16 cm, then each unit length is 16 \u00f7 3 = 5.33... cm\nFor ratio 7: 7 \u00d7 5.33... = 37.33... cm\nFor ratio 3: 16 cm\nFor ratio 2: 2 \u00d7 5.33... = 10.67... cm\nTotal length = 37.33... + 16 + 10.67... = 64 cm\n#### 64\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 96.0\nSince the shortest part is consists of 2 parts, then each part is equal to 16 cm/2 = 8 cm.\nThe whole wire was cut into 7 + 3 + 2 = 12 parts.\nHence, the wire was 8 cm x 12 = 96 cm long\n#### 96"
