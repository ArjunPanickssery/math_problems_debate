      "content": "QUESTION: A box of chocolate bars was shared equally between Mike, Rita and Anita. If the box contains 12 bars, how many bars did Mike and Rita get (combined)?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 8.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nMike and Rita together got 4+4 = 8 bars\n#### 8\n(A): 4.0\nA box of 12 bars was shared equally between 3 people so each person got 12/3 = 4 bars\nSince Mike and Rita shared the bars, they got 4 bars together\n#### 4\n## Argument in favour of B\nLet me demonstrate why 8 bars is the correct answer using mathematical reasoning:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12/3\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12/3\"},\n    \"result\": 4.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nLet me demonstrate why 8 bars is the correct answer using mathematical reasoning:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12/3\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12/3\"},\n    \"result\": 4.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nWhen 12 chocolate bars are divided equally among 3 people, each person receives 4 bars. Mike and Rita together represent 2 of those 3 people. Therefore, they would receive 4 bars each, totaling 8 bars. The calculation is straightforward: 4 + 4 = 8. This means Mike and Rita combined get 8 bars from the original box of 12 bars.\n"
