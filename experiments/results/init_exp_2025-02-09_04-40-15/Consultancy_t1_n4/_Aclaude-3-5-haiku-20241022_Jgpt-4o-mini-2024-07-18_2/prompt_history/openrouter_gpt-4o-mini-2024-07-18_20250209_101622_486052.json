How many students played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 65.0\n37 - 9 = 28 students played kickball on Thursday.\nSo, 37 + 28 = 65 students played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday.\n#### 65\n(A): 83.0\nOn Thursday, there was a difference of 9 students, so 37 + 9 = 46 students played on Thursday.\nTherefore, 37 + 46 = 83 students played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday.\n#### 83\n## Argument in favour of B\nI'll help argue for answer (B): 65.0. Let me break this down mathematically to demonstrate why this is the correct solution.\n\nFirst, let's verify the number of students on Thursday:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"37 - 9\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"37 - 9\"},\n    \"result\": 28,\n}\n</tool_result>\nI'll help argue for answer (B): 65.0.

On Thursday, 9 fewer students played, which means 28 students.

The problem statement indicates 9 fewer students on Thursday, which directly leads to 28 students that day. Adding Wednesday's 37 students to Thursday's 28 students results in a total of 65 students.\n"
