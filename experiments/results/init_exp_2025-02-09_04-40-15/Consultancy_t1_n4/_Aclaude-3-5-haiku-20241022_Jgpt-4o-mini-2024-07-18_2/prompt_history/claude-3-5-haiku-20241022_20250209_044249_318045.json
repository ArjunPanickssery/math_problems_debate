If Maria wants to buy 3 dozens flowers, how many pieces of flowers will she have in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 42.0\nMaria has 3 x 2 = 6 free flowers from buying 3 dozens flowers.\nSince each dozen is equal to 12, then Maria bought 3 x 12 = 36 flowers.\nHence, she has a total of 36 + 6 = 42 flowers.\n#### 42\n(B): 44.0\nFirst calculating the regular flowers: 3 x 12 = 36 flowers\nAdding the free flowers for each dozen: 36 + (3 x 2) = 42 flowers\nAdding the free flowers for the total purchase: 42 + 2 = 44 flowers\n#### 44\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 44.0\nFirst calculating the regular flowers: 3 x 12 = 36 flowers\nAdding the free flowers for each dozen: 36 + (3 x 2) = 42 flowers\nAdding the free flowers for the total purchase: 42 + 2 = 44 flowers\n#### 44"
