      "content": "QUESTION: Hilary is shucking corn from ears that grew on her farm. She gets four ears of corn per stalk, and she has 108 stalks growing. Half the ears of corn have 500 kernels of corn and the other half have 100 more. How many kernels of corn does Hilary have to shuck?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 237600.0\nShe has 108 * 4 = 432 ears of corn to shuck.\nShe gets 500 kernels of corn from half the ears and 500 + 100 = 600 kernels from the other half.\nHalf the number of ears of corn is 432 / 2 = 216 ears.\nThus, Hilary has 216 * 500 + 216 * 600 = 108000 + 129600 = 237600 kernels to shuck.\n#### 237600\n(B): 259200\nShe has 108 * 4 = 432 ears of corn to shuck.\nEach ear of corn has 500 kernels as a base amount.\nAdding the additional 100 kernels to each ear gives 600 kernels per ear.\nThus, Hilary has 432 * 600 = 259200 kernels to shuck.\n#### 259200\n## Argument in favour of A\nI will demonstrate why answer (A) 237,600 is the correct solution. Let me break down the calculation step by step using the math_eval tool to verify key computations.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the total number of corn ears:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"108 * 4\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"108 * 4\"},\n    \"result\": 432,\n}\n</tool_result>\nI will demonstrate why answer (A) 237,600 is the correct solution.

By splitting the ears equally between 500 and 600 kernels, we accurately represent the problem's conditions and arrive at the precise total.\n\nThe mathematical proof is clear: 237,600 kernels is the correct answer.
