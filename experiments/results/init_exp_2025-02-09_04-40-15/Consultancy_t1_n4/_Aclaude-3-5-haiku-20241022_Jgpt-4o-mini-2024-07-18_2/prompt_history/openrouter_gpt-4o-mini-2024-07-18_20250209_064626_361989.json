      "content": "QUESTION: Maddy is in college for 8 semesters. She needs 120 credits to graduate. If each class is 3 credits, how many classes does she need to take per semester?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 5.0\n120 credits / 3 credits is 40.\n40 credits/ 8 semester = 5 classes per semester.\nMaddy needs to take 5 classes per semester\n#### 5\n(B): 15\nStarting with 120 total credits required\nDividing by 8 semesters gives us 15 credits per semester\nConverting to classes by dividing these semester credits by 3 credits per class\nThis means 15 classes per semester are needed\n#### 15\n## Argument in favour of A\nI'll help argue for Answer A (5.0 classes per semester). Let me break this down systematically using the math_eval tool to verify calculations.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the total number of credits needed:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120 / 3\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120 / 3\"},\n    \"result\": 40.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nI'll help argue for Answer A (5.0 classes per semester). Let me break this down systematically using the math_eval tool to verify calculations.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the total number of credits needed:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120 / 3\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120 / 3\"},\n    \"result\": 40.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThis confirms that 120 total credits divided by 3 credits per class equals 40 total classes. Now, let's divide these classes across 8 semesters:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"40 / 8\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"40 / 8\"},\n    \"result\": 5.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThis confirms that 120 total credits divided by 3 credits per class equals 40 total classes. Now, let's divide these classes across 8 semesters:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"40 / 8\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"40 / 8\"},\n    \"result\": 5.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe math clearly shows Maddy needs exactly 5 classes per semester to graduate. The calculation is straightforward: 120 total credits \u00f7 3 credits per class = 40 total classes, then 40 total classes \u00f7 8 semesters = 5 classes per semester. This approach ensures a consistent, balanced course load throughout her college journey.\n"
