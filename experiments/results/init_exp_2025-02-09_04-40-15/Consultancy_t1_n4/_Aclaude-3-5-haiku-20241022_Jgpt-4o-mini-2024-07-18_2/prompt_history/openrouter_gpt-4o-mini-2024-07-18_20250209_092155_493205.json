      "content": "QUESTION: A child is making a 5-level pyramid by stacking some blocks. In the first row, he has 9 blocks. For the next rows, he has 2 less than the blocks he has from its bottom row. How many blocks did he use in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 25.0\nOn the second row, he used 9 - 2 = 7 blocks.\nOn the third row, he used 7 - 2 = 5 blocks.\nOn the fourth row, he used 5 - 2 = 3 blocks.\nOn the fifth row, he used 3 - 2 = 1 block.\nTherefore, he used a total of 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 25 blocks.\n#### 25\n(A): 37.0\nThe first row has 9 blocks.\nEach subsequent row should have 2 less than the first row, so they each have 7 blocks.\nTherefore, we have one row of 9 blocks and four rows of 7 blocks.\nThe total number of blocks is 9 + (4 \u00d7 7) = 9 + 28 = 37 blocks.\n#### 37\n## Argument in favour of B\nI'll argue for answer (B): 25.0, demonstrating how the child builds the pyramid by reducing blocks in each row.\n\nLet me verify the calculation step by step:\n\nFirst row: 9 blocks<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"9\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"9\"},\n    \"result\": 9,\n}\n</tool_result>\nI'll argue for answer (B): 25.0, demonstrating how the child builds the pyramid by reducing blocks in each row.\n\nLet me verify the calculation step by step:\n\nFirst row: 9 blocks<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"9\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"9\"},\n    \"result\": 9,\n}\n</tool_result>\nSecond row: 9 - 2 = 7 blocks<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"9 - 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"9 - 2\"},\n    \"result\": 7,\n}\n</tool_result>\nSecond row: 9 - 2 = 7 blocks<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"9 - 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"9 - 2\"},\n    \"result\": 7,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThird row: 7 - 2 = 5 blocks<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"7 - 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"7 - 2\"},\n    \"result\": 5,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThird row: 7 - 2 = 5 blocks<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"7 - 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"7 - 2\"},\n    \"result\": 5,\n}\n</tool_result>\nFourth row: 5 - 2 = 3 blocks<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"5 - 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"5 - 2\"},\n    \"result\": 3,\n}\n</tool_result>\nFourth row: 5 - 2 = 3 blocks<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"5 - 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"5 - 2\"},\n    \"result\": 3,\n}\n</tool_result>\nFifth row: 3 - 2 = 1 block<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"3 - 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"3 - 2\"},\n    \"result\": 1,\n}\n</tool_result>\nFifth row: 3 - 2 = 1 block<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"3 - 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"3 - 2\"},\n    \"result\": 1,\n}\n</tool_result>\nTotal blocks: 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 25<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1\"},\n    \"result\": 25,\n}\n</tool_result>\nTotal blocks: 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 25<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1\"},\n    \"result\": 25,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe pyramid's block count follows a clear, systematic reduction pattern.
