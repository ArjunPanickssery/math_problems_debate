      "content": "QUESTION: Celia runs twice as fast as Lexie. If it takes Lexie 20 minutes to run a mile, how long, in minutes, will it take Celia to 30 miles?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 300.0\nIf Lexie takes 20 minutes to run a mile, Celia takes 20/2 = 10 minutes to run the same distance since she is twice as fast.\nCelia takes 10 minutes to run one mile so it will take 10*30 = 300 minutes to run 30 miles.\n#### 300\n(A): 1200.0\nFor one mile, since Celia runs twice as fast as Lexie, she will take 20 * 2 = 40 minutes.\nTo run 30 miles, she will need 40 * 30 = 1200 minutes.\n#### 1200\n## Argument in favour of B\nI'll help argue for answer (B): 300.0. Let me break this down systematically:\n\nFirst, let's verify the speed calculation:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"20/2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"20/2\"},\n    \"result\": 10.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nI'll help argue for answer (B): 300.0. Let me break this down systematically:\n\nFirst, let's verify the speed calculation:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"20/2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"20/2\"},\n    \"result\": 10.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nSince Lexie takes 20 minutes per mile and Celia runs twice as fast, she'll take 10 minutes per mile. This is crucial to our calculation. \n\nNow, let's confirm the total time for 30 miles:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"10*30\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"10*30\"},\n    \"result\": 300,\n}\n</tool_result>\nSince Lexie takes 20 minutes per mile and Celia runs twice as fast, she'll take 10 minutes per mile. This is crucial to our calculation. \n\nNow, let's confirm the total time for 30 miles:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"10*30\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"10*30\"},\n    \"result\": 300,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe math clearly shows Celia will take exactly 300 minutes to run 30 miles. The logic is straightforward: if she runs twice as fast as Lexie, her per-mile time is halved, and multiplying that by 30 miles gives us 300 minutes.\n"
