On each subsequent day, he increased his running distance by 1 kilometer over the previous day. If he runs for 5 days a week, how many kilometers did he run on the 5th day?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 6.0\nOn the second day, Arvin ran 2 + 1 = 3 kilometers.\nOn the third day, he ran 3 + 1 = 4 kilometers.\nOn the fourth day, he ran 4 + 1 = 5 kilometers.\nSo on the fifth day, he ran 5 + 1 = 6 kilometers.\n#### 6\n(B): 12\nFirst day: 2km\nSecond day: 2 + 1 = 3km\nThird day: 3 + 2 = 5km\nFourth day: 5 + 3 = 8km\nFifth day: 8 + 4 = 12km\n#### 12\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 6.0\nOn the second day, Arvin ran 2 + 1 = 3 kilometers.\nOn the third day, he ran 3 + 1 = 4 kilometers.\nOn the fourth day, he ran 4 + 1 = 5 kilometers.\nSo on the fifth day, he ran 5 + 1 = 6 kilometers.\n#### 6"
