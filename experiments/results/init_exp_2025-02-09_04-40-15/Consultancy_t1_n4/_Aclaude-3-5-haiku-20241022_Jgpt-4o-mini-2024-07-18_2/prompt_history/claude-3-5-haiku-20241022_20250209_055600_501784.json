For the next rows, he has 2 less than the blocks he has from its bottom row. How many blocks did he use in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 25.0\nOn the second row, he used 9 - 2 = 7 blocks.\nOn the third row, he used 7 - 2 = 5 blocks.\nOn the fourth row, he used 5 - 2 = 3 blocks.\nOn the fifth row, he used 3 - 2 = 1 block.\nTherefore, he used a total of 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 25 blocks.\n#### 25\n(A): 37.0\nThe first row has 9 blocks.\nEach subsequent row should have 2 less than the first row, so they each have 7 blocks.\nTherefore, we have one row of 9 blocks and four rows of 7 blocks.\nThe total number of blocks is 9 + (4 \u00d7 7) = 9 + 28 = 37 blocks.\n#### 37\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 25.0\nOn the second row, he used 9 - 2 = 7 blocks.\nOn the third row, he used 7 - 2 = 5 blocks.\nOn the fourth row, he used 5 - 2 = 3 blocks.\nOn the fifth row, he used 3 - 2 = 1 block.\nTherefore, he used a total of 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 25 blocks.\n#### 25"
