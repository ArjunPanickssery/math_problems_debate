How many hours does he have to watch a day?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2.0\nHe wants to watch 20*30=600 minutes\nSo he needs to watch 600/60=10 hours\nThat means he needs to watch 10/5=2 hours a day\n#### 2\n(B): 1.2\nFirst find total minutes: 20 * 30 = 600 minutes\nConvert to hours: 600 / 100 = 6 hours total\nDivide by 5 days: 6 / 5 = 1.2 hours per day\n#### 1.2\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 1.2\nFirst find total minutes: 20 * 30 = 600 minutes\nConvert to hours: 600 / 100 = 6 hours total\nDivide by 5 days: 6 / 5 = 1.2 hours per day\n#### 1.2"
