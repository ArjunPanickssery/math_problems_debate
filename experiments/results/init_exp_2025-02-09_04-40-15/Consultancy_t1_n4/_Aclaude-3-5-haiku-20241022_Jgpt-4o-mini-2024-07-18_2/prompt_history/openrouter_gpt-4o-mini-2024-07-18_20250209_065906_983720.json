      "content": "QUESTION: There are 4,000 jelly beans in a jar. If three fourths of the jelly beans are red, and one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, how many jelly beans are coconut flavored?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 750.0\nThere are 4000/4*3=3000 red jelly beans.\nThere are 3000/4=750 coconut flavored jelly beans.\n#### 750\n(A): 1000.0\nFirst find one quarter of all jelly beans: 4000/4 = 1000\nSince these coconut ones must be among the red ones, and three fourths are red, \nthe coconut flavored ones are: 1000\n#### 1000\n## Argument in favour of B\nI'll help argue for answer (B): 750.0. Let me break this down step by step using mathematical evaluation.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of red jelly beans:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4000 * (3/4)\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4000 * (3/4)\"},\n    \"result\": 3000.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nI'll help argue for answer (B): 750.0. Let me break this down step by step using mathematical evaluation.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of red jelly beans:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4000 * (3/4)\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4000 * (3/4)\"},\n    \"result\": 3000.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nWe have 3,000 red jelly beans. Now, we want to find how many of these are coconut flavored, which is one-quarter of the red jelly beans:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"3000 * (1/4)\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"3000 * (1/4)\"},\n    \"result\": 750.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nWe have 3,000 red jelly beans. Now, we want to find how many of these are coconut flavored, which is one-quarter of the red jelly beans:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"3000 * (1/4)\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"3000 * (1/4)\"},\n    \"result\": 750.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThis precisely matches our answer of 750 coconut-flavored jelly beans. The calculation is clear: three-fourths of 4,000 are red (3,000), and one-fourth of those red jelly beans are coconut flavored (750). The math is straightforward and unambiguous.\n"
