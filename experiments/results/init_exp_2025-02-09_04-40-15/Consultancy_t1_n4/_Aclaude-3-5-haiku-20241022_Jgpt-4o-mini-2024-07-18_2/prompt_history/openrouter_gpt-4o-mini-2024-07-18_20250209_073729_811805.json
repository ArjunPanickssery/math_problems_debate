How many total toys does he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nHe buys 2*20=40 toy cars\nSo the total number of toys is 20+40=60\n#### 60\n(A): 40.0\nHe buys twice as many toy soldiers as cars\nThis means he buys 2*20=40 toy soldiers\nThis is the total number of toys\n#### 40\n## Argument in favour of B\nI'll help argue for answer (B): 60.0. Let me break this down step by step:\n\nFirst, let's verify the number of toy cars:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"20\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"20\"},\n    \"result\": 20,\n}\n</tool_result>\nI'll help argue for answer (B): 60.0.
