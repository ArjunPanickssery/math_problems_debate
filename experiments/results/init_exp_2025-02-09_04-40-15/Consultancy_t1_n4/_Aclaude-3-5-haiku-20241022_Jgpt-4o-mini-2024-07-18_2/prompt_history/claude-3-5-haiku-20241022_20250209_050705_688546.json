      "content": "QUESTION: Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, while her sister has two more dolls than their grandmother. If their grandmother has 50 dolls, how many dolls do they have altogether?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 258.0\nIf the grandmother has 50 dolls, Rene's sister, who has 2 more dolls than their grandmother, has 50+2 = 52 dolls.\nTogether, Rene's sister and the grandmother have 52+50 = 102 dolls.\nSince Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, she has 52*3 = 156 dolls.\nAltogether, they have 156+102 = 258 dolls.\n#### 258\n(B): 658.0\nStarting with grandmother's 50 dolls, we first multiply by 3 to get 150.\nAdding 2 gives us the sister's number of dolls: 152.\nSince Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, she has 152*3 = 456 dolls.\nThe total number of dolls is therefore 50+152+456 = 658.\n#### 658\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 658.0\nStarting with grandmother's 50 dolls, we first multiply by 3 to get 150.\nAdding 2 gives us the sister's number of dolls: 152.\nSince Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, she has 152*3 = 456 dolls.\nThe total number of dolls is therefore 50+152+456 = 658.\n#### 658"
