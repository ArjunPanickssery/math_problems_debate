Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Therefore, if we work backwards, we start with 10 blue envelopes and add 4 to find the yellow envelopes: 10 + 4 = 14 yellow envelopes.

My opponent's interpretation of subtraction is incorrect because \"fewer than\" indicates a comparison, not a subtraction operation. When we say \"4 fewer than 10,\" we mean we need to add 4 to reach 10, not subtract 4 from 10.\n\n</transcript>"
