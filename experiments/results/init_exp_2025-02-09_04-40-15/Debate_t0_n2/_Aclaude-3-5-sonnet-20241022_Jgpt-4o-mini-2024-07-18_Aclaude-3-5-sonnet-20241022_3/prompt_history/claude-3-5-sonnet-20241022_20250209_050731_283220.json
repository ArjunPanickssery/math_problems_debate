Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many tickets on average did she sell during one of these three days?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 80.0\nCarol sold 960 / 4 = 240 tickets during three days.\nSo in one day, she sold on average 240 / 3 = 80 tickets.\n#### 80\n(A): 1280\nFirst divide the total money by days to get daily revenue\n$960 / 3 = $320 per day\nThen since each ticket is $4, that means she sold 320 \u00d7 4 = 1280 tickets per day\n#### 1280</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"
