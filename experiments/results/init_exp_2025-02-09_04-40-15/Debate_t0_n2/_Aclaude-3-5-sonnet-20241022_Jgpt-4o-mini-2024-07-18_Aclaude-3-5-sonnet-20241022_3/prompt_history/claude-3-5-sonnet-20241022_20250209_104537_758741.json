Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many apples did Sara eat?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 16.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: A = 4S\nWhich means: 4S + S = 80\nSo: 5S = 80\nSo the number of apples Sara ate is: S = 80 / 5= 16 apples\n#### 16\n(A): 64.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: S = 4A\nWhich means: A + 4A = 80\nSo: 5A = 80\nTherefore: A = 16\nAnd finally: S = 4A = 4 \u00d7 16 = 64 apples\n#### 64</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe key is understanding that when we say \"Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara,\" this means Ali's portion is 4 times Sara's portion. Let's solve this mathematically. If Sara ate S apples, then Ali ate 4S apples. The total is 80 apples, so:\n\nS + 4S = 80\n\nLet me evaluate this:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"80 / 5\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"80 / 5\"},\n    \"result\": 16.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe key is understanding that when we say \"Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara,\" this means Ali's portion is 4 times Sara's portion.

This makes perfect sense because 64 is indeed 4 times more than 16, and together they sum to 80 apples. The interpretation that leads to Sara eating 16 apples would mean Ali ate fewer apples than Sara, which contradicts the clear statement that Ali ate 4 times more.\n\n</transcript>"
