Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The calculation showing 3 weeks is correct because the question asks about calendar weeks, not reading sessions.

Since there are 7 days in a week:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"21 / 7\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"21 / 7\"},\n    \"result\": 3.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\n\nThis equals exactly 3 weeks. The opposing calculation incorrectly focuses on reading days rather than calendar weeks. The question asks \"how many weeks,\" not \"how many reading sessions divided by 3.\" A week is always 7 days, regardless of which days contain reading sessions.",
