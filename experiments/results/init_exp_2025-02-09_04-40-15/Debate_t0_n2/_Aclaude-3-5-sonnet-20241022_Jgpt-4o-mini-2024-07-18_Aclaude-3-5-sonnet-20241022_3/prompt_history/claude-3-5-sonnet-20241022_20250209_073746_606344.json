Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The key insight is that we need to account for the twenty-year time difference twice. Let me explain why answer A (64) is correct. When we say \"twenty years ago, Shane was 2 times older than Garret is now,\" we're dealing with two different time periods. Let's calculate:\n\n1. Shane's age twenty years ago = 2 \u00d7 Garret's current age\n2. Using current values: Shane's past age = 2 \u00d7 12 = 24\n\nNow, here's the crucial part: we need to add 20 years TWICE:\n- First +20 years because Shane has aged 20 years since then\n- Second +20 years to account for the time difference in the comparison\n\nLet me verify: 24 + 20 + 20 = 64",
