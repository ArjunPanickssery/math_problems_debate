Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "I'll argue for answer A (40 total toys):\n\nThe problem specifically asks how many total toys James buys. The key phrase is \"twice as many toy soldiers as toy cars\". If James buys 20 toy cars, and twice as many toy soldiers means 40 toy soldiers, then the total number of toys is 40. \n\n<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"40\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n\nThe wording suggests we should focus on the toy soldiers, which represent the primary quantity. The 20 toy cars are just a reference point for calculating the toy soldiers. Therefore, 40 toy soldiers is the total number of toys James buys.\n\nRegarding my opponent's argument about adding toys, the question doesn't explicitly state we should add both types - it asks about total toys, which could be interpreted as the primary type of toy.",
