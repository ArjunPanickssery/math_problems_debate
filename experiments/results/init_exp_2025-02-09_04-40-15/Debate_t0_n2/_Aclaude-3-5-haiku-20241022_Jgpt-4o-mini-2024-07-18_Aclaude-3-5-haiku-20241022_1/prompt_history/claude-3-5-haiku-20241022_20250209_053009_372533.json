Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many yellow crayons are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 32.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:5+14=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)-6=32 crayons\n#### 32\n(A): 44.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:14+5=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)+6=44 crayons\n#### 44</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nI'll argue for Answer A (44 yellow crayons):\n\nThe key to solving this problem is carefully tracking the relationships between crayon colors. We start with 14 red crayons. Blue crayons are 5 more than red, which means 14 + 5 = 19 blue crayons. For yellow, the problem states \"6 less than double the blue crayons\". Double the blue crayons is 19 \u00d7 2 = 38, and then we subtract 6, which gives us 38 - 6 = 32. However, the problem actually asks us to add 6, not subtract 6. So the correct calculation is 19 \u00d7 2 + 6 = 44 yellow crayons. This matches Answer A precisely, making 44 the correct solution.\n\n</transcript>"
