          "content": "I'll argue in favor of answer B (160.0) being the correct solution.\n\nThe problem clearly states that Brianne saves $10 in January and doubles her savings each month. Let's trace the progression systematically:\n\nJanuary: $10\nFebruary: $10 \u00d7 2 = $20\nMarch: $20 \u00d7 2 = $40\nApril: $40 \u00d7 2 = $80\nMay: $80 \u00d7 2 = $160\n\nThis follows the explicit doubling rule stated in the problem. Each month, her savings exactly double from the previous month. The calculation is straightforward and linear, with no complex modifications. The step-by-step progression shows a clear, consistent pattern of doubling, which leads directly to $160 in May. The arithmetic is simple and transparent, making 160 the most logical answer.",
