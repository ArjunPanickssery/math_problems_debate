Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

      "content": "<question>QUESTION: Twenty years ago, Shane was 2 times older than Garret is now. If Garret is currently 12, how old is Shane now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 44.0\nTwenty years ago, Shane was 12 * 2 = 24 years old\nShane is currently 24 + 20 = 44 years old\n#### 44\n(A): 64.0\nFirst, we know Shane was 2 times Garret's current age of 12\nSo Shane was 12 * 2 = 24\nThen we need to account for the twenty year difference twice\nAdding 20 years for Shane and 20 years for the time difference\nSo Shane is currently 24 + 40 = 64 years old\n#### 64</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nI will argue for answer A (64.0) with the following reasoning:\n\nThe key to solving this problem is carefully tracking the age progression over time. Twenty years ago, Shane was 24 years old (2 times Garret's current age of 12). But we must account for both Shane's own aging and the time passage. When we add 20 years to Shane's age from 20 years ago (24), we get 44. However, we also need to add another 20 years to represent the total time difference, which brings Shane's current age to 64. This two-step aging process ensures we correctly calculate Shane's present age by considering both his original age and the full time elapsed.\n\n</transcript>"
