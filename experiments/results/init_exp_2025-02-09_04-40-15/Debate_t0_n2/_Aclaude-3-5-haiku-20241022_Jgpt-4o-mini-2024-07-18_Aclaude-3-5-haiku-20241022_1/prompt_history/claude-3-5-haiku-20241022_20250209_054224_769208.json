Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many yellow crayons are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 32.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:5+14=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)-6=32 crayons\n#### 32\n(A): 44.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:14+5=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)+6=44 crayons\n#### 44</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nI'll argue for answer B (32 yellow crayons) being correct.\n\nThe problem clearly states we have 14 red crayons, and there are 5 more blue crayons than red crayons. So blue crayons = 14 + 5 = 19 crayons. The yellow crayon count is defined as double the blue crayons, minus 6. \n\nLet's calculate: Double blue crayons is 19 \u00d7 2 = 38, then subtract 6, which gives us 32 yellow crayons. The algebraic steps are precise and follow the problem's instructions exactly. \n\nThe calculation 19(2) - 6 = 32 matches the problem description perfectly, showing a clear, logical progression from the given information to the final yellow crayon count.\n\n</transcript>"
