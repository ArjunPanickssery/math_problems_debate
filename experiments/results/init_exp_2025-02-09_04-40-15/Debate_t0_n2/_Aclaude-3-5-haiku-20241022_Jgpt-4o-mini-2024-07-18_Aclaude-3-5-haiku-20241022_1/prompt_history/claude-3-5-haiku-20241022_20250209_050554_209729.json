Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "I will argue forcefully for Answer A (6.0):\n\nThe problem clearly states James buys 3 CDs, with two CDs at 1.5 hours each and the third CD being twice as long. Let's break this down systematically:\n\n1. Two shorter CDs: 1.5 hours \u00d7 2 = 3 hours\n2. Long CD: 1.5 hours \u00d7 2 = 3 hours\n3. Total CD length: 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours\n\nThe arithmetic is straightforward and follows directly from the problem statement. Each step is logically derived from the given information. The total length of 6 hours represents the complete time of all three CDs, matching exactly with the calculation in Answer A. The computation is clear, precise, and matches the problem's description perfectly.",
