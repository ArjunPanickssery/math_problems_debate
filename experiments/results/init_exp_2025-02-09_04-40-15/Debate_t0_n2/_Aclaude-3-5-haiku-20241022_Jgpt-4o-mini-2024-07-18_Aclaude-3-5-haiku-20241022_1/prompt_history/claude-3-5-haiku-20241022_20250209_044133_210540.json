Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "I'll argue forcefully for answer A: $576.\n\nThe key insight is understanding how discounts work. When Lyra pays $480, this represents the price AFTER the 20% discount. To find the original price, we need to calculate the discount amount and add it back.\n\nThe discount is 20% of the original price. Since Lyra paid $480, this means $480 represents 80% of the original price. We can calculate the discount amount by finding the difference between the original price and the discounted price.\n\n$96 was discounted (20% of the original price), so we add this back to the paid price:\n$480 + $96 = $576\n\nThis method directly shows the original price was $576, accounting for the 20% discount that brought the price down to $480. The math is straightforward and transparent.",
