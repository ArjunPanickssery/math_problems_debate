Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The correct answer is 60%. To calculate the percentage off, we need to divide the amount saved by the original price. Asia saved $210 (the difference between $350 and $140), and the original price was $350. $210 divided by $350 equals 0.60, which represents 60% off. This is a standard percentage discount calculation used in retail. The calculation is straightforward: (Original Price - Sale Price) / Original Price = Percentage Discount. In this case, ($350 - $140) / $350 = 0.60 or 60%. The other answer of 150% doesn't make mathematical sense in the context of a sale price.",
