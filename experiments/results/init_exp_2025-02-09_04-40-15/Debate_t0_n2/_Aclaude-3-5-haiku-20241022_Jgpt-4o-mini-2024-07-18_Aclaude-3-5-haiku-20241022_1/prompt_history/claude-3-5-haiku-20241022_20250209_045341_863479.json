Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

However, the key detail is that a round trip actually involves driving to town AND back, which means 6 hours total per trip. With two trips per month, she spends 12 hours driving monthly. Over 12 months, this calculation results in 12 \u00d7 12 = 144 hours of driving per year. The previous argument incorrectly counted only one-way travel time, not the full round trip. By carefully tracking both the outbound and return journeys, 144 hours is the correct total annual driving time for Melissa.",
