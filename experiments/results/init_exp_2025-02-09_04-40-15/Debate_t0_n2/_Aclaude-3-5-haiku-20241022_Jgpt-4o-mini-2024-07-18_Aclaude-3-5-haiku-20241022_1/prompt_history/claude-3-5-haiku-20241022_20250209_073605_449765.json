Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If Haley has 25 necklaces, how many more necklaces does Haley have than Josh?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 15.0\nJason has 25-5 = 20 necklaces.\nJosh has 20/2 = 10 necklaces.\nHaley has 25-10 = 15 more necklaces than Josh.\n#### 15\n(A): 10.0\nHaley has 25 necklaces\nJason must have 25+5 = 30 necklaces\nJosh has half of Jason's, so 30/2 = 15 necklaces\nThe difference between Haley and Josh is 25-15 = 10 necklaces\n#### 10</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nI'll argue in favor of Answer A (10 necklaces):\n\nThe key to solving this problem is carefully tracking the relationships between Haley, Jason, and Josh's necklaces. Haley has 25 necklaces, and we know she has 5 more necklaces than Jason. This means Jason must have 30 necklaces (25 - 5 = 30). Since Josh has half of Jason's necklaces, Josh would have 15 necklaces (30 \u00f7 2 = 15). The difference between Haley's 25 necklaces and Josh's 15 necklaces is exactly 10 necklaces. This approach follows the problem's logic step-by-step and provides a clear, mathematically sound solution that matches Answer A.\n\n</transcript>"
