Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How much does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50\n(A): 100.0\nFirst calculate what fraction remains: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\nSince 2/3 was spent, multiply $150 by 2/3: $150 * (2/3) = $100\nThis is the amount she has left.\n#### 100</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is B: $50. The problem clearly states that the housewife spent 2/3 of her $150, which means she has 1/3 of her money remaining. By calculating 1/3 of $150, we arrive precisely at $50. The mathematical reasoning is straightforward: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3, and $150 * (1/3) = $50. The key is to understand that if she spent 2/3 of her money, the remaining fraction is 1/3, which directly translates to $50. The calculation is simple and unambiguous, making $50 the definitive amount left in her possession after shopping.\n\n</transcript>"
