Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "My argument for Answer A (84):\n\nThe problem clearly states that Andrew's dog has 12 burrs, and six times as many ticks as burrs. This means we must calculate the number of ticks by multiplying the number of burrs by 6. So 12 burrs \u00d7 6 = 72 ticks. When we add the burrs and ticks together, we get a total of 84 foreign objects in the dog's fur. The calculation follows a straightforward multiplication and addition process. The key is understanding that \"six times as many ticks as burrs\" means multiplying the number of burrs by 6 to determine the tick count. Answer A provides the correct mathematical reasoning and arrives at the precise total of 84 objects.",
