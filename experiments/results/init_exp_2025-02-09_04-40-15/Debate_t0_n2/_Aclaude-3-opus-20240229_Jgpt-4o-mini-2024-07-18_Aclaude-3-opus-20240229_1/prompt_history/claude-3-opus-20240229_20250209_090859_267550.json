Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Here's why:\n\nThere are a total of 14 apples per box, and 3 boxes, so 14 \u00d7 3 = 42 apples total. Henry and his brother each eat 1 apple per day, so together they consume 2 apples per day.\n\nTo calculate how many weeks the apples will last, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples consumed per week:\n42 apples \u00f7 (2 apples/day \u00d7 7 days/week) = 42 \u00f7 14 = 3 weeks per person\nSince Henry and his brother each get 3 weeks worth of apples, the total duration is 3 + 3 = 6 weeks.\n\n</transcript>"
