      "content": "<question>QUESTION: Celia runs twice as fast as Lexie. If it takes Lexie 20 minutes to run a mile, how long, in minutes, will it take Celia to 30 miles?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 300.0\nIf Lexie takes 20 minutes to run a mile, Celia takes 20/2 = 10 minutes to run the same distance since she is twice as fast.\nCelia takes 10 minutes to run one mile so it will take 10*30 = 300 minutes to run 30 miles.\n#### 300\n(A): 1200.0\nFor one mile, since Celia runs twice as fast as Lexie, she will take 20 * 2 = 40 minutes.\nTo run 30 miles, she will need 40 * 30 = 1200 minutes.\n#### 1200</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nCelia runs twice as fast as Lexie, which means it takes her half as long to run the same distance. Since Lexie takes 20 minutes to run a mile, Celia would only take 10 minutes per mile. To calculate how long it would take Celia to run 30 miles, we simply multiply her pace of 10 minutes per mile by 30 miles, giving us a total time of 300 minutes for Celia to run 30 miles. Therefore, the correct answer is 300 minutes, not 1200 minutes.\n\n</transcript>"

We are told that Celia runs twice as fast as Lexie, and that it takes Lexie 20 minutes to run a mile.\n\nTo calculate how long it would take Celia to run a mile, we can use this information:\n- Lexie's speed: 1 mile / 20 minutes \n- Celia's speed is twice Lexie's, so: \n  Celia's speed = 2 * (1 mile / 20 minutes)\n               = 1 mile / 10 minutes\n\nSo Celia runs 1 mile in 10 minutes. \n\nTo calculate how long it would take her to run 30 miles, we can use:",
