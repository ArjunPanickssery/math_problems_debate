Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many yellow crayons are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 32.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:5+14=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)-6=32 crayons\n#### 32\n(A): 44.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:14+5=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)+6=44 crayons\n#### 44</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThere are 44 yellow crayons. Here's why:\n\nWe know there are 14 red crayons. The question states there are 5 more blue crayons than red crayons. So if there are 14 red crayons, there must be 14 + 5 = 19 blue crayons.\n\nNow, the key is understanding what \"6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons\" means. Double the blue crayons is 19 * 2 = 38. And the number of yellow crayons is 6 more than that. So 38 + 6 = 44 yellow crayons.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 44 yellow crayons.\n\n</transcript>"

      "content": "<thinking>\nThe key point of contention seems to be how to interpret the phrase \"6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons\". My opponent interpreted this as meaning to add 6 to double the blue crayons to get the number of yellow crayons. However, I believe the correct interpretation is to subtract 6 from double the blue crayons.\n\nTo determine which tools may be helpful:\n- math_eval could be used to calculate the number of blue crayons by evaluating \"14 + 5\" \n- math_eval could then be used again to double the number of blue crayons\n- Finally, math_eval could subtract 6 from the doubled blue crayons to get the number of yellow\n\nSo math_eval should be sufficient to calculate the result in a step-by-step manner.
