Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The question states that one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, not one quarter of all the jelly beans. Therefore, we first need to determine the number of red jelly beans, which is three fourths of the total 4,000 jelly beans. Three fourths of 4,000 is 3,000 red jelly beans. Now, one quarter of these 3,000 red jelly beans are coconut flavored. One quarter of 3,000 is 750. Thus, the correct answer is that there are 750 coconut flavored jelly beans, not 1,000.",
