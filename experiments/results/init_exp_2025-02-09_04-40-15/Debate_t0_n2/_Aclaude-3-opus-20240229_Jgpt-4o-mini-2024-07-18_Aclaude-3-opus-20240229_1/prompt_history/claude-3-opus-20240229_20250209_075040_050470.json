Mr. Curtis has a total of 325 chickens, of which 28 are roosters. Therefore, the number of hens is 325 - 28 = 297. The question states that 20 hens do not lay eggs, but this does not mean we should add those 20 non-laying hens to the total. The 297 hens already include both the laying and non-laying hens. To find the number of egg-laying hens specifically, we must subtract the 20 non-laying hens from the total of 297 hens: 297 - 20 = 277.\n\n</transcript>"

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key points in favor of answer B (277 egg-laying hens) are:\n- There are a total of 325 chickens\n- 28 of the chickens are roosters\n- Therefore, the number of hens is 325 - 28 = 297\n- Out of the 297 hens, 20 do not lay eggs\n- So the number of egg-laying hens specifically is 297 - 20 = 277\n\nThe argument for answer A incorrectly adds the 20 non-laying hens to the total of 297 hens. But the 297 hens already includes both laying and non-laying hens. There's no need to add the 20 non-laying hens again.\n\nTo calculate the number of egg-laying hens, we should start with the total number of hens (297) and subtract the non-laying hens (20). This gives 277 egg-laying hens, which matches answer B.\n\nNo additional information or calculations are needed. The question provides all the necessary numbers to solve this in a straightforward way.\n</thinking>\n\n<result>\nThe correct answer is B, 277 egg-laying hens. Here's why:\n\nMr. Curtis has a total of 325 chickens. We are told 28 of those are roosters. By subtracting the roosters from the total, we can determine there are 325 - 28 = 297 hens in total. \n\nThe 297 hens include both the hens that lay eggs and the 20 hens that do not lay eggs. There is no need to add the 20 non-laying hens to the 297 total like the argument for A does. That would be double counting those 20 hens.\n\nTo determine how many of the 297 hens are egg-laying, we simply need to subtract the 20 non-laying hens. 297 total hens - 20 non-laying hens = 277 egg-laying hens. Therefore, B is correct that Mr. Curtis has 277 egg-laying hens.\n</result>",
