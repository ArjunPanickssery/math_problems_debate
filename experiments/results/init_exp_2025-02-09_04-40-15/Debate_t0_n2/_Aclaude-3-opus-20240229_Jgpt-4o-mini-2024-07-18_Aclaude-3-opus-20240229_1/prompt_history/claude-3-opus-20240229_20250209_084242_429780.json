Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

      "content": "<question>QUESTION: Henry believes in the famous phrase, \"An apple a day, keeps the doctor away.\" If a box contains 14 apples, how many weeks can Henry and his brother spend eating 3 boxes of apples if they each eat 1 apple a day?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 3.0\nThere are a total of 14 apples/box x 3 boxes = 42 apples in the 3 boxes.\nSo, Henry and his brother each have 42 apples / 2 people = 21 apples/person to consume.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, thus, both of them can consume the 3 boxes of apples in 21 / 7 = 3 weeks.\n#### 3\n(B): 6.0\nThere are a total of 14 apples/box \u00d7 3 boxes = 42 apples in the 3 boxes.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, the number of weeks the apples will last is:\n42 apples \u00f7 7 days/week = 6 weeks\n#### 6</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe calculation in answer A is correct. There are a total of 42 apples in the 3 boxes. Since Henry and his brother are each eating 1 apple per day, we need to divide the total apples by 2 to determine how many apples each person gets. 42 apples / 2 people = 21 apples per person. With 7 days in a week, each person's 21 apples will last them 21 / 7 = 3 weeks. Therefore, Henry and his brother can spend 3 weeks eating the 3 boxes of apples at a rate of 1 apple per day each.\n\n</transcript>"

      "content": "<thinking>\nThe key difference between the two answers is how they account for Henry and his brother each eating 1 apple per day. \n\nAnswer A first divides the total 42 apples by 2 to determine how many apples each person gets (21 apples each). It then divides 21 by 7 days per week to calculate that each person's apples will last 3 weeks.\n\nIn contrast, Answer B divides the total 42 apples by 7 days per week to calculate 6 weeks total. However, this does not account for the fact that the apples are being consumed by 2 people (Henry and his brother).\n\nTo determine which answer is correct, we need to calculate:\n- Total apples (14 per box * 3 boxes)\n- Apples consumed per day (1 per person * 2 people) \n- Weeks the apples will last (total apples / apples per day / 7 days per week)\n\nThe math_eval tool can help with the first two calculations. The result of total apples / apples per day will tell us the total days the apples last. We can then divide that by 7 to get the number of weeks.\n</thinking>",
