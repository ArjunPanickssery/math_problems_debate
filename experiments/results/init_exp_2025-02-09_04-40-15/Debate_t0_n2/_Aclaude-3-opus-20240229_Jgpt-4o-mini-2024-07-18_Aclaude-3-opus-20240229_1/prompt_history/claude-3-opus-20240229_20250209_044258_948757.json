Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The total cost of her purchase was therefore $216 + $66 = $282. Since she gave the cashier $250, the change she should receive is $250 - $282 = -$32. The negative number indicates that she did not give the cashier enough money to cover the total cost of her purchase.",
