Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How old am I now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 17.0\nIn 2 years, my dog will be 4 years old, so my dog is 4 - 2 = 2 years old now.\nSo I am 15 + 2 = 17 years old now.\n#### 17\n(B): 19.0\nI was 15 when my dog was born. My dog will be 4 years old in 2 years.\nSo my current age is 15 + 4 = 19 years old.\n#### 19</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is 19 years old. The key information is that I was 15 when my dog was born, and in 2 years my dog will be 4 years old. We can directly add those numbers together: 15 (my age when dog was born) + 4 (dog's age in 2 years) = 19 (my current age). My opponent's error is subtracting 2 from the dog's future age of 4 to try to calculate the dog's current age, but that step is unnecessary. We only need my age when the dog was born and the dog's age in the future to calculate my current age.\n\n</transcript>"

      "content": "<thinking>\nThe key to refuting my opponent's argument is to show that their calculation does not account for the 2 year gap between now and when the dog will be 4. \n\nTo calculate my current age, we need to:\n1. Determine how old the dog is now by subtracting the 2 year future timeframe from the dog's age of 4 at that future point. This will tell us the dog's current age.\n2. Add the dog's current age to my age of 15 when the dog was born. \n\nSo the relevant calculations are:\n- 4 (dog's age in 2 years) - 2 (years from now) = 2 (dog's current age) \n- 15 (my age when dog born) + 2 (dog's current age) = 17 (my current age)\n\nMy opponent's error is adding 4 directly to 15 without accounting for the 2 year gap between now and the future point when the dog will be 4.
