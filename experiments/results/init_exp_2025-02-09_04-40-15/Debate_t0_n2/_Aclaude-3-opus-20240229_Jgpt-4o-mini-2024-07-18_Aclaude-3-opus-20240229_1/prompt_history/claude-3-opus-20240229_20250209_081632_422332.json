Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If three fourths of the jelly beans are red, and one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, how many jelly beans are coconut flavored?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 750.0\nThere are 4000/4*3=3000 red jelly beans.\nThere are 3000/4=750 coconut flavored jelly beans.\n#### 750\n(A): 1000.0\nFirst find one quarter of all jelly beans: 4000/4 = 1000\nSince these coconut ones must be among the red ones, and three fourths are red, \nthe coconut flavored ones are: 1000\n#### 1000</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe question states that one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, not one quarter of all the jelly beans. Therefore, we first need to determine the number of red jelly beans, which is three fourths of the total 4,000 jelly beans. Three fourths of 4,000 is 3,000 red jelly beans. Now, one quarter of these 3,000 red jelly beans are coconut flavored. One quarter of 3,000 is 750. Thus, the correct answer is that there are 750 coconut flavored jelly beans, not 1,000.\n\n</transcript>"
