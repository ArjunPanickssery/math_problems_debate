Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many marbles does Katie have in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 33.0\nFind the number of orange marbles. 13 marbles - 9 marbles = 4 marbles\nFind the number of purple marbles. 4 marbles x 4 = 16marbles\nFind the total amount of pink, orange, and purple marbles. 13 marbles + 4 marbles + 16 marbles = 45 marbles\n#### 33\n(A): 123\nFind the number of orange marbles. 13 marbles + 9 marbles = 22 marbles\nFind the number of purple marbles. 22 marbles \u00d7 4 = 88 marbles\nFind the total amount of pink, orange, and purple marbles. 13 marbles + 22 marbles + 88 marbles = 123 marbles\n#### 123</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nKatie has 13 pink marbles, and we know she has 9 fewer orange marbles than pink marbles. To find the number of orange marbles, we take the number of pink marbles (13) and subtract 9, which equals 22 orange marbles.\n\nNext, we're told Katie has 4 times as many purple marbles as orange marbles. Since we calculated 22 orange marbles, we multiply that by 4 to get 88 purple marbles.\n\nTo find the total, we add up all three amounts: 13 pink + 22 orange + 88 purple = 123 total marbles.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) 123 marbles.\n\n</transcript>"
