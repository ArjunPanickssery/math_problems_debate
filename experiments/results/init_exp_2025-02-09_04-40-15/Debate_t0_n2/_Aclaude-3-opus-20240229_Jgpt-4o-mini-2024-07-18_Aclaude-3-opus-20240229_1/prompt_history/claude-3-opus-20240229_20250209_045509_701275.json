Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "John's initial height was 66 inches. Over the course of 3 months, he grew by 2 inches each month. To calculate his total growth, we multiply the monthly growth (2 inches) by the number of months (3), which equals 6 inches. Adding this to his initial height, we get 66 + 6 = 72 inches. To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 72 inches divided by 12 equals 6 feet. Therefore, after his growth spurt, John is 6 feet tall.",
