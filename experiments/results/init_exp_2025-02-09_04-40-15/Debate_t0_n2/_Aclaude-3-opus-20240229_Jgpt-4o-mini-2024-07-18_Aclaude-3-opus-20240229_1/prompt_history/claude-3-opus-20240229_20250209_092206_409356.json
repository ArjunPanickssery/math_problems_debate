Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

      "content": "<question>QUESTION: There are 4,000 jelly beans in a jar. If three fourths of the jelly beans are red, and one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, how many jelly beans are coconut flavored?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 750.0\nThere are 4000/4*3=3000 red jelly beans.\nThere are 3000/4=750 coconut flavored jelly beans.\n#### 750\n(A): 1000.0\nFirst find one quarter of all jelly beans: 4000/4 = 1000\nSince these coconut ones must be among the red ones, and three fourths are red, \nthe coconut flavored ones are: 1000\n#### 1000</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is 750. Here's why:\n\nThe question states that there are 4,000 total jelly beans, and three fourths of them are red. To calculate the number of red jelly beans, we multiply the total number of jelly beans by the fraction that are red:\n\n4,000 * 3/4 = 3,000 red jelly beans\n\nNext, the question tells us that one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored. So to find the number of coconut flavored jelly beans, we take the number of red jelly beans (3,000) and multiply by one quarter:\n\n3,000 * 1/4 = 750 coconut flavored jelly beans\n\nTherefore, the correct number of coconut flavored jelly beans is 750, making answer choice B correct.\n\n</transcript>"
