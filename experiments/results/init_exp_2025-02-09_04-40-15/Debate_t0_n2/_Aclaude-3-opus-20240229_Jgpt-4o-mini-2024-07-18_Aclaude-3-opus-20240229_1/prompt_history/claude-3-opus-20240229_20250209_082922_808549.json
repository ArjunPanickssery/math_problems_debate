Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The question is asking for the difference in total annual earnings between the two jobs, not just the difference in hourly pay rate. While it's true that James' hourly rate increased by $4 and multiplying that by his new hours and weeks worked gives $8320, that doesn't account for the fact that he was already earning money at his old job. To find the actual increase in annual earnings, we need to calculate the total annual pay for each job and then find the difference:\n\nNew job: $20/hour * 40 hours/week * 52 weeks/year = $41,600 per year\nOld job: $16/hour * 25 hours/week * 52 weeks/year = $20,800 per year \n\n$41,600 - $20,800 = $20,800\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: James makes $20,800 more per year at his new job compared to his old job.",
