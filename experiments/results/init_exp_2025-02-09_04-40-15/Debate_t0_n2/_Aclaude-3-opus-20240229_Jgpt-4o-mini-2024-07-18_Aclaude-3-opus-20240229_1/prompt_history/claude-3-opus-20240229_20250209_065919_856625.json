If Garret is currently 12, how old is Shane now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 44.0\nTwenty years ago, Shane was 12 * 2 = 24 years old\nShane is currently 24 + 20 = 44 years old\n#### 44\n(A): 64.0\nFirst, we know Shane was 2 times Garret's current age of 12\nSo Shane was 12 * 2 = 24\nThen we need to account for the twenty year difference twice\nAdding 20 years for Shane and 20 years for the time difference\nSo Shane is currently 24 + 40 = 64 years old\n#### 64</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nShane was 2 times Garret's current age 20 years ago. So 20 years ago, Shane was 12 * 2 = 24 years old. But we need to add 20 years to Shane's age to get his current age, since the question is asking about Shane now, not Shane 20 years ago. Additionally, we need to add another 20 years to account for the 20 year time difference mentioned in the question. So in total, we add 40 years to Shane's age from 20 years ago. 24 + 40 = 64. Therefore, Shane is currently 64 years old.\n\n</transcript>"

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key point my opponent is making is that we need to add 40 years total to Shane's age from 20 years ago - 20 years for Shane aging, and another 20 years to account for the time difference mentioned in the question. \n\nHowever, I don't believe this is the correct interpretation. The question states Shane's age relative to Garret's current age, but from the perspective of 20 years ago. It's not saying to add the 20 year time difference on top of that.\n\nTo calculate Shane's current age, we just need to:\n1. Calculate Shane's age 20 years ago based on Garret's current age (12 * 2 = 24)  \n2. Add 20 years to get from Shane's age 20 years ago to his current age\n\nSo the calculation should be:\n(Garret's current age * 2) + 20 \n= (12 * 2) + 20\n= 24 + 20 \n= 44\n\nI don't believe any tools are needed here, as it's a straightforward calculation that can be done mentally.\n</thinking>\n\nThe question states that 20 years ago, Shane was 2 times older than Garret is now. We're told Garret is currently 12. So 20 years ago, Shane was 12 * 2 = 24 years old.\n\nTo get Shane's current age, we simply need to add 20 years to his age from 20 years ago. 24 + 20 = 44. \n\nTherefore, Shane is 44 years old now, not 64. The question does not say to add the 20 year time difference on top of doubling Garret's current age. It's just stating Shane's age relative to Garret's current age, from the perspective of 20 years in the past. We then add 20 years to that past age to bring Shane to the present day.",
