Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100\n(B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe ratio 2:1:3 means that for every 1 part Amy gets, Sandra gets 2 parts and Ruth gets 3 parts. Since Amy got $50, we need to determine how much 1 part is worth. The total number of parts is 2+1+3 = 6. So if the total amount distributed is 6 parts and Amy's 1 part is $50, then 1 part is worth $50/1 = $50. Therefore, Sandra's 2 parts are worth 2 * $50 = $100.\n\n</transcript>"

The ratio 2:1:3 tells us the relative sizes of the shares each person gets, but we need to determine the value of 1 part first before we can calculate the dollar amounts.\n\nThe argument for answer B incorrectly states that Sandra's share is calculated by dividing Amy's amount by her number of parts. This is not how ratios work.\n\nTo properly calculate Sandra's share, we first need to determine how much 1 part is worth, given that Amy's 1 part is $50. Then we can multiply that by Sandra's 2 parts to get her total amount.\n\nSo the steps are:\n1. Calculate the total number of parts (2+1+3 = 6) \n2. Divide Amy's amount by her number of parts to get the value of 1 part ($50 / 1 = $50)\n3. Multiply the value of 1 part by Sandra's number of parts (2 * $50 = $100)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A, $100. The argument for B misunderstands how to work with ratios.\n</thinking>",
