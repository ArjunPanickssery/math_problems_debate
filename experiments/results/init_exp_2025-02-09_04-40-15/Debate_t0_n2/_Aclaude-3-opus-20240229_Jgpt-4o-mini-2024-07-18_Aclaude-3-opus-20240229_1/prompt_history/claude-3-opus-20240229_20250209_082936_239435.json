Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

      "content": "<question>QUESTION: Belle eats 4 dog biscuits and 2 rawhide bones every evening. If each rawhide bone is $1, and each dog biscuit is $0.25, then how much does it cost, in dollars, to feed Belle these treats for a week?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 21.0\nA week's worth of rawhide bones cost 1*2*7=14 dollars.\nA week's worth of dog biscuits cost 0.25*4*7=7 dollars,\nThus, in total, it cost 14+7=21 dollars\n#### 21\n(A): 31.50\nThe rawhide bones cost 4*1*7=28 dollars.\nThe dog biscuits cost 2*0.25*7=3.50 dollars.\nThus, in total, it costs 28+3.50=31.50 dollars\n#### 31.50</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is B: $21.00. Here's why:\n\nBelle eats 4 dog biscuits and 2 rawhide bones every evening. Each dog biscuit costs $0.25 and each rawhide bone costs $1. So for one evening, the cost is:\n\n4 dog biscuits * $0.25 = $1\n2 rawhide bones * $1 = $2\nTotal per evening = $1 + $2 = $3\n\nThere are 7 evenings in a week. So to calculate the weekly cost, we multiply the daily cost by 7:\n\n$3 per evening * 7 evenings = $21 per week\n\nTherefore, it costs $21 to feed Belle these treats for a week. The other answer incorrectly calculates the cost of the bones and biscuits.\n\n</transcript>"

The key information given is:\n- Each dog biscuit costs $0.25 \n- Each rawhide bone costs $1\n- Belle eats this every evening\n- We need to calculate the cost for a week\n\nTo calculate the total, we need to:\n1. Calculate the cost per evening \n2. Multiply the cost per evening by 7 to get the weekly cost\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The parameters we have are:\n- 4 dog biscuits at $0.25 each\n- 2 rawhide bones at $1 each \n- 7 days in a week\n\nSo we can calculate the cost per evening with:\n4 * 0.25 + 2 * 1\n\nAnd then multiply that by 7 to get the weekly cost.\n\nWe have all the necessary information to perform these calculations with the math_eval tool.\n</thinking>",
