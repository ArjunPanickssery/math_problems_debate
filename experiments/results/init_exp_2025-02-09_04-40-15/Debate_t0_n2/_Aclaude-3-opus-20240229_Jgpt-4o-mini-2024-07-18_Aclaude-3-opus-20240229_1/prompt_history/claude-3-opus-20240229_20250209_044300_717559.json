Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

So the total cost of the items before tax was $6 + $4 + $1 + $1 = $12. However, the tax was an additional $3, making the total cost including tax $12 + $3 = $15. \n\nSince they started with $18 and the total cost was $15, the change they should have received is $18 - $15 = $3. Therefore, the correct answer is A, not B.",
