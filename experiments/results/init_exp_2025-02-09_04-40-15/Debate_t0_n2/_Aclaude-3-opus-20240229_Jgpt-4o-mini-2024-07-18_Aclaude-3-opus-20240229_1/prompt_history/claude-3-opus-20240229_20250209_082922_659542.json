Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

For the next rows, he has 2 less than the blocks he has from its bottom row. How many blocks did he use in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 25.0\nOn the second row, he used 9 - 2 = 7 blocks.\nOn the third row, he used 7 - 2 = 5 blocks.\nOn the fourth row, he used 5 - 2 = 3 blocks.\nOn the fifth row, he used 3 - 2 = 1 block.\nTherefore, he used a total of 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 25 blocks.\n#### 25\n(A): 37.0\nThe first row has 9 blocks.\nEach subsequent row should have 2 less than the first row, so they each have 7 blocks.\nTherefore, we have one row of 9 blocks and four rows of 7 blocks.\nThe total number of blocks is 9 + (4 \u00d7 7) = 9 + 28 = 37 blocks.\n#### 37</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"

Let's break it down row by row:\n\n1st row: 9 blocks\n2nd row: 9 - 2 = 7 blocks \n3rd row: 7 - 2 = 5 blocks\n4th row: 5 - 2 = 3 blocks\n5th row: 3 - 2 = 1 block\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 25 total blocks.\n\nThe question clearly states that each subsequent row has 2 less blocks than the row below it. The other answer incorrectly assumes each row after the first has a constant 7 blocks. But this contradicts the problem statement. Following the given pattern of subtracting 2 blocks per row leads us to the correct sum of 25 blocks total.",
