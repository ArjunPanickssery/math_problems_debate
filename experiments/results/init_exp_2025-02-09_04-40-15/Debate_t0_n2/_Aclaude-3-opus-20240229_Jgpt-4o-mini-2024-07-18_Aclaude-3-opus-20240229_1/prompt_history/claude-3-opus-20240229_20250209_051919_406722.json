Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The correct answer is 64 slightly used crayons. To calculate this, we first find the number of new crayons by dividing the total 120 crayons by 3, which equals 40 new crayons. We then subtract the 40 new crayons from the total 120 crayons, leaving us with 80 remaining crayons. From these 80 remaining crayons, 20% are broken. To find the number of broken crayons, we multiply 80 by 0.20, which equals 16 broken crayons. Finally, to find the number of slightly used crayons, we subtract the 16 broken crayons from the 80 remaining crayons, giving us 64 slightly used crayons.",
