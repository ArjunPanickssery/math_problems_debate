Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Let me explain why:\n\nThe question states that the farm has 5 less than 9 times the number of roosters. If we let x be the number of roosters, then the number of hens is represented by 9x-5.\n\nAdding the number of hens and roosters gives us the total number of chickens: \n9x-5 + x = 75\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation:\n10x - 5 = 75\n\nAdding 5 to both sides:\n10x = 80\n\nDividing both sides by 10:\nx = 8\n\nSo there are 8 roosters. Plugging this back into the expression for the number of hens:\n9(8) - 5 = 72 - 5 = 67\n\nTherefore, the farm has 67 hens, which corresponds to answer choice (A).\n\n</transcript>"

However, they made an error when solving the equation:\n\n9x-5 + x = 75\n10x - 5 = 75\n\nAt this point, they added 5 to both sides to get:\n10x = 80\n\nBut this is incorrect. The correct next step is to add 5 to both sides to get:\n10x = 80\n\nThen dividing both sides by 10 gives:\nx = 8\n\nPlugging x=8 back into the expression for the number of hens:\n9(8) - 5 = 72 - 5 = 67\n\nThis shows that answer A, 67 hens, is actually the correct answer.
