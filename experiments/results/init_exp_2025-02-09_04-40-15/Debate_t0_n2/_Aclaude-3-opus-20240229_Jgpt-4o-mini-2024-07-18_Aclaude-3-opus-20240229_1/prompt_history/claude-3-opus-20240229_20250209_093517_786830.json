Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

      "content": "<question>QUESTION: John starts climbing a very steep hill.  He travels 1 foot vertically for every two feet horizontally.  His elevation increases from 100 feet to 1450 feet.  How far does he move horizontally, in feet?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2700.0\nHe travels 1450-100=1350 feet vertically\nSo he travels 1350*2=2700 feet horizontally\n#### 2700\n(B): 2900.0\nHe reaches an elevation of 1450 feet\nSince he moves 2 feet horizontally for each vertical foot, he travels 1450*2=2900 feet horizontally\n#### 2900</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nJohn's elevation increases by 1450 - 100 = 1350 feet. Since he travels 1 foot vertically for every 2 feet horizontally, his horizontal distance is double his vertical distance. Therefore, he travels 1350 * 2 = 2700 feet horizontally. The key point is that we need to consider the change in elevation, not the final elevation, to determine the horizontal distance traveled.\n\n</transcript>"

This assumes that for every 1 foot of elevation, John travels 2 feet horizontally.\n\nHowever, the opponent's argument points out that we should consider the change in elevation of 1350 feet, since John started at an elevation of 100 feet. Multiplying the change in elevation by 2 gives 2700 feet.\n\nTo determine which is correct, I would need to calculate the change in elevation and see if multiplying that by 2 matches the given horizontal distance.
