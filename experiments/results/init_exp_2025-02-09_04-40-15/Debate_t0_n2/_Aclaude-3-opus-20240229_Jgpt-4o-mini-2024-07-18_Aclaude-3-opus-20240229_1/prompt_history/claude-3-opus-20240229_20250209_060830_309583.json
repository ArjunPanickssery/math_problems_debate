Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "Sam's overall win rate cannot be 60% across all 200 matches. We are told he won 50% of his first 100 matches, which is 50 wins. Then in his next 100 matches, he won 60%, which is 60 more wins. So in total, he won 50 + 60 = 110 matches out of the 200 he played. His overall win rate is therefore 110/200 = 55%, not 60%. The calculation in answer A incorrectly assumes his 60% win rate in the last 100 matches applies to all 200 matches, which is not the case given the information provided in the question.",
