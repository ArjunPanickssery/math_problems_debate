      "content": "<question>QUESTION: Isabel has some money in her piggy bank. She spent half the amount and bought a toy. She then spent half of the remaining money and bought her brother a book. If she has $51 left, how much money, in dollars, did she have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 204.0\nAfter buying the toy, Isabel has 51*2=102 dollars left.\nIsabel had 102*2=204 dollars at first.\n#### 204\n(A): 408.0\nWorking backwards from what's left:\n51 * 2 = 102 is the previous amount\n102 * 2 = 204 is the amount before that\n204 * 2 = 408 was the initial amount\n#### 408</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct answer is 408 dollars. Let's work backwards from the $51 that Isabel has left at the end. Before buying her brother the book, she had double that amount, which is $102. And before buying the toy, she had double the $102, which comes to $204. Therefore, the amount she started with must have been double $204, or $408 total. The key is to realize that each time Isabel spends half her money, the remaining amount is half of what she had before spending. So to find the initial amount, we need to double the remaining money twice.\n\n</transcript>"

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key to solving this problem is working backwards from the amount Isabel has left at the end. We know she spent half her money twice - once to buy a toy, and once to buy her brother a book. So to find the amount she started with, we need to double the remaining money twice.\n\nThe argument for answer B only doubles the remaining money once to get $102, and then doubles that again to get $204. But this skips a step. Before the final $51, there was an intermediate step where Isabel had half of $204, or $102. \n\nTo get the correct initial amount, we need to double the $51 to get the previous amount of $102. Then double $102 to get the amount before that, which is $204. Finally, double $204 to get the initial amount of $408.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to verify the doubling calculations, but the key conceptual step is realizing that we need to double the remaining money twice, not just once, to account for Isabel spending half her money two separate times. The argument for B misses this insight.\n</thinking>",
