Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many packs did he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 360.0\nJohn has 6*30=180 students\nSo he bought 180*2=360 packs\n#### 360\n(A): 12.0\nCalculate number of classes: 6\nMultiply by 2 packs per class: 6*2=12\n#### 12</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nJohn buys 2 packs of index cards for each of his 6 classes, not for each individual student. The question states \"John buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students.\" This means he is buying the packs for the classes as a whole, not per student. Since there are 6 classes, and he buys 2 packs per class, the total number of packs is 6 * 2 = 12. The number of students per class is irrelevant to calculating the total packs purchased.\n\n</transcript>"

The key will be focusing on the exact wording of the question.\n\nThe question states \"John buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students.\" This phrasing suggests the packs are being purchased on a per-student basis, not just per class. If it was only 2 packs per class, it would more likely say something like \"John buys 2 packs of index cards for each of his classes.\"  \n\nTo calculate the total packs, I first need to determine the total number of students John has across all his classes. The question provides the relevant information - 6 classes with 30 students each. I can use the math_eval tool to multiply 6 * 30 to get the total students.\n\nThen, knowing he buys 2 packs per student, I can take the total student count and multiply it by 2 using math_eval again to arrive at the total packs purchased, which should be 360.\n</thinking>",
