Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many bags of chips did he eat?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 3.0\nHe ate 2 * 1 = 2 bags after dinner\nSo he ate 2 + 1 = 3 bags of chips\n#### 3\n(A): 2.0\nHe ate 1 bag for dinner\nApply the doubling: 1 * 2 = 2 bags in total\n#### 2</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nJohn ate 1 bag of chips for dinner. After dinner, he ate twice as many bags as he did for dinner. Since he ate 1 bag for dinner, he must have eaten 2 bags after dinner. In total, he ate the 1 bag from dinner plus the 2 bags after dinner, which equals 3 bags of chips altogether. The problem states he ate twice as many bags after dinner compared to what he ate for dinner, so the key is to add the initial 1 bag to the 2 additional bags eaten afterwards.\n\n</transcript>"
