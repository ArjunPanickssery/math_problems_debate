Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Then Kayla picked 4(x+10) apples, which means she picked 4 times the amount Kylie picked plus an additional 40 apples. \nThe total apples picked is 340, so we can set up the equation:\nx + 4(x+10) = 340\nSimplifying:\nx + 4x + 40 = 340\n5x + 40 = 340\n5x = 300\nx = 60\nSo Kylie picked 60 apples. Plugging this back in, Kayla picked 4(60+10) = 4(70) = 280 apples.\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 280 apples.",
