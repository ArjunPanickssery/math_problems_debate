Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100\n(B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nSandra got $100. The ratio of money shared between Sandra, Amy and Ruth is 2:1:3 respectively. This means that for every 1 part Amy gets, Sandra gets 2 parts. Since we know Amy got $50, we can determine Sandra's amount by multiplying Amy's $50 by 2, which equals $100. The ratio shows the relative proportions each person receives, so Sandra's 2 parts means she gets double what Amy got.\n\n</transcript>"

The amount of money Amy received ($50)\n\nWe are told both of these pieces of information directly in the question. The ratio shows the relative proportions each person receives. Since Amy's portion is represented by 1 in the ratio, and Sandra's by 2, we can determine Sandra's amount by adjusting Amy's known $50 based on the ratio.\n\nNo additional information or tool calls are needed. We can calculate Sandra's amount directly from the given ratio and Amy's amount.\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the given ratio of 2:1:3, Sandra's share is represented by 2 while Amy's is 1. This means that Sandra's share is 2 times the size of Amy's share.\n\nWe are told Amy received $50.
