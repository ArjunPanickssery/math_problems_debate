Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The question states Shane's age relative to Garret's current age, not Garret's age 20 years ago. There's no need to account for the 20 year time difference twice. Adding 40 years to Shane's age from 20 years ago would only make sense if the question was asking about Shane's age 20 years in the future from now.",
