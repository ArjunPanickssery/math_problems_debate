If it takes Lexie 20 minutes to run a mile, how long, in minutes, will it take Celia to 30 miles?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 300.0\nIf Lexie takes 20 minutes to run a mile, Celia takes 20/2 = 10 minutes to run the same distance since she is twice as fast.\nCelia takes 10 minutes to run one mile so it will take 10*30 = 300 minutes to run 30 miles.\n#### 300\n(A): 1200.0\nFor one mile, since Celia runs twice as fast as Lexie, she will take 20 * 2 = 40 minutes.\nTo run 30 miles, she will need 40 * 30 = 1200 minutes.\n#### 1200</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nCelia runs twice as fast as Lexie, which means it takes her half as long to run the same distance. Since Lexie takes 20 minutes to run a mile, Celia would only take 10 minutes per mile. To calculate how long it would take Celia to run 30 miles, we simply multiply her pace of 10 minutes per mile by 30 miles, giving us a total time of 300 minutes for Celia to run 30 miles. Therefore, the correct answer is 300 minutes, not 1200 minutes.\n\n</transcript>"

The argument for answer A incorrectly claims Celia would take 40 minutes per mile, when in fact she takes half the time of Lexie per mile, which is 10 minutes.\n</thinking>\n\nThe argument for answer A is incorrect. It claims that since Celia runs twice as fast as Lexie, she will take twice as long, 40 minutes, to run a mile. But the opposite is true - running twice as fast means taking half as long. \n\nSince Lexie takes 20 minutes per mile, Celia takes half that, which is 10 minutes per mile. We can confirm this with the calculation:\n\nCelia's speed = 2 * Lexie's speed\n             = 2 * (1 mile / 20 min) \n             = 1 mile / 10 min\n\nSo at a pace of 1 mile per 10 minutes, the time for Celia to run 30 miles is:\n\n30 miles * 10 min/mile = 300 minutes\n\nTherefore, 300 minutes is definitively the correct answer, not 1200 minutes. The argument for A fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between speed and time.",
