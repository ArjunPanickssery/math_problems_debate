Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The question states that the box of 12 chocolate bars was shared equally between Mike, Rita and Anita. This means that each person received an equal number of bars. Since there are 3 people and 12 bars, each person must have received 4 bars (12 divided by 3 equals 4). Therefore, Mike received 4 bars and Rita also received 4 bars. The question asks how many bars Mike and Rita got combined, which is simply the sum of their individual amounts: 4 bars for Mike plus 4 bars for Rita equals a total of 8 bars.",
