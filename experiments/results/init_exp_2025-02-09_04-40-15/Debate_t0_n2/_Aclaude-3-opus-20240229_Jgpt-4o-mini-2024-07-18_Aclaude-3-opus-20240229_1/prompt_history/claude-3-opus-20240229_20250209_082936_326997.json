Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If she has $51 left, how much money, in dollars, did she have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 204.0\nAfter buying the toy, Isabel has 51*2=102 dollars left.\nIsabel had 102*2=204 dollars at first.\n#### 204\n(A): 408.0\nWorking backwards from what's left:\n51 * 2 = 102 is the previous amount\n102 * 2 = 204 is the amount before that\n204 * 2 = 408 was the initial amount\n#### 408</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nIsabel started with some amount of money. After spending half on a toy, she had half the original amount left. Then she spent half of that remaining amount on a book for her brother, leaving her with $51. To find the original amount, we need to work backwards, doubling the amount twice. $51 doubled is $102, which is the amount she had after buying the toy. $102 doubled is $204, which must have been the original amount she started with in her piggy bank.\n\n</transcript>"

      "content": "<thinking>\nTo determine the correct answer, we need to work backwards from the $51 that Isabel has left at the end. The key steps are:\n1. Isabel spent half of her remaining money on a book for her brother, and ended up with $51. So before buying the book, she must have had $51 * 2 = $102.\n2. Prior to that, Isabel spent half of her original money on a toy. So if she had $102 after buying the toy, she must have started with $102 * 2 = $204.\n\nThe question is whether she started with $204 (answer B) or $408 (answer A). To figure this out, we can check the math:\n- If she started with $204, spent half ($102) on a toy, then spent half of the remaining $102 ($51) on a book, she would be left with $51, which matches the question.\n- If she started with $408, spent half ($204) on a toy, then spent half of the remaining $204 ($102) on a book, she would be left with $102, which does not match the $51 stated in the question.\n\nSo the math clearly shows that answer B ($204) is correct, and answer A ($408) is incorrect. The flaw in the argument for A is that it includes an extra doubling step at the end which is not justified by the information given in the question.\n</thinking>",
