Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

In the second tree, there was 1 nest with 3 eggs, adding 3 more to the total. Finally, the nest in her front yard had 4 eggs. So the total number of eggs is the sum of the eggs in each location: 10 eggs from the first tree + 3 eggs from the second tree + 4 eggs from the front yard nest = 17 eggs in total.",
