          "content": "<thinking>\nTo determine which answer is correct, I'll evaluate the logic and calculations in each one.\n\nAnswer A:\n- Starts with the total credits needed (120) and divides by credits per class (3) to get total classes needed (40). This is correct.\n- Then divides total classes needed (40) by total semesters (8) to get classes per semester (5). This calculation is also correct.\n\nAnswer B: \n- Starts with total credits (120) and divides by total semesters (8) to get credits per semester (15). This is correct.\n- Then claims to convert semester credits to classes, but actually just states the semester credits (15) as the number of classes. This is incorrect - it should divide the 15 semester credits by the 3 credits per class.\n\nBased on this, Answer A has the correct logic and calculations throughout, while Answer B makes an error in the last step. I'll argue that Answer A is correct.\n</thinking>\n\nAnswer A is the correct answer. Here's why:\n\nThe question tells us Maddy needs 120 total credits to graduate, and that each class is worth 3 credits. To find the total number of classes needed, we divide the total credits by the credits per class:\n\n120 credits / 3 credits per class = 40 classes\n\nThis matches the first step of Answer A. \n\nNext, we need to determine how many of those 40 classes Maddy should take each semester to graduate in 8 semesters. We calculate this by dividing the total classes by the number of semesters:\n\n40 classes / 8 semesters = 5 classes per semester\n\nAgain, this matches Answer A's second step and final conclusion. Each step is logically sound and the math is correct.\n\nIn contrast, Answer B makes an error by stating the credits per semester (15) is equal to the number of classes per semester. It fails to do the final conversion from credits to classes. If Maddy took 15 3-credit classes per semester, that would be 45 credits per semester, or 360 total - way more than the 120 required.\n\nTherefore, Answer A correctly determines Maddy needs to average 5 classes per semester, while Answer B is incorrect.",
