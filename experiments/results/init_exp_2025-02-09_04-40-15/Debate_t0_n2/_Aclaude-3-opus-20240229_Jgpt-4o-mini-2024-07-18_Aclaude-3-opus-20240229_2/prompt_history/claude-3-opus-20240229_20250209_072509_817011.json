Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many marbles Katrina has (can be determined from Mabel's marble count)\n2. How many marbles Amanda has (can be determined once we know Katrina's marble count)\n\nThen we can subtract Amanda's marbles from Mabel's to get the difference.\n\nThe math_eval tool is not needed here as the calculations are straightforward. All the required information is provided in the question.\n</thinking>\n\nBased on the information given, we can determine that Katrina has 17 marbles, since Mabel's 85 marbles are 5 times Katrina's amount (85 / 5 = 17).\n\nThe question states that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many as Katrina. So if Katrina has 17, then twice that amount is 34. And since Amanda needs 12 more to reach that amount, she currently has 34 - 12 = 22 marbles. \n\nTherefore, Mabel with her 85 marbles has 85 - 22 = 63 more marbles than Amanda. So answer choice (A) 63 is correct.",
