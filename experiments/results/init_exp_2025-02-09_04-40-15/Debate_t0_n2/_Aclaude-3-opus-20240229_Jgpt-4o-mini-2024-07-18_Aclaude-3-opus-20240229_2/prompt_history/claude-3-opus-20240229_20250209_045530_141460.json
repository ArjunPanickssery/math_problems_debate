Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question asks how many of Sam's 18 cows are not black, given that 5 more than half the cows are black. To determine this, I need to:\n\n1. Calculate half of the total number of cows\n2. Add 5 to that number to get the number of black cows \n3. Subtract the number of black cows from the total to get the number of non-black cows\n\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful for steps 1 and 2. For step 1, I can pass it the expression \"18/2\" to calculate half the cows. For step 2, I can pass it the result of step 1 plus 5.\n\nI have the total number of cows (18) from the question, so I don't need any additional information to complete the calculation.\n</thinking>",
