Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key information provided in the question is:\n- The ratio of money shared between Sandra, Amy and Ruth is 2:1:3\n- Amy got $50\nTo determine how much Sandra got, we need to understand how ratios work. The ratio 2:1:3 means that for every 1 part Amy gets, Sandra gets 2 parts and Ruth gets 3 parts.\nSince we know the amount Amy got ($50), we can directly calculate Sandra's amount by multiplying Amy's amount by Sandra's part in the ratio (2).\nNo additional tools are needed, as we have all the necessary information to calculate Sandra's amount using the given ratio and Amy's known amount.\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the given ratio of 2:1:3, Sandra gets 2 parts for every 1 part that Amy gets. This means that to calculate Sandra's amount, we simply need to multiply Amy's amount by 2.\n\nWe know that Amy got $50. Therefore, using the ratio:\n\nSandra's amount = Amy's amount * Sandra's part in the ratio\n                = $50 * 2\n                = $100\n\nSo Sandra got $100, which is double the amount that Amy received, as per the 2:1:3 ratio.",
