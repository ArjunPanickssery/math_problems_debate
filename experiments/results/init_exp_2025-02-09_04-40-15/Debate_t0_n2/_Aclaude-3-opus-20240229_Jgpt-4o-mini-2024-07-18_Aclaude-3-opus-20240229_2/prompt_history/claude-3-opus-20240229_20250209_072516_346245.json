          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key pieces of information given in the question are:\n- Darla has 6 books\n- Katie has half as many books as Darla\n- Gary has 5 times the number of books that Darla and Katie have combined\n\nTo calculate the total number of books, we need to:\n1. Find how many books Katie has based on Darla's book count\n2. Add Darla and Katie's books to get their combined total\n3. Multiply the combined Darla+Katie total by 5 to get Gary's book count \n4. Sum Darla, Katie and Gary's books for the final total\n\nThe key step is calculating Katie's books correctly as half of Darla's. My assigned answer B does this properly:\n- Darla: 6 books \n- Katie: 6/2 = 3 books\n\nThen it follows the remaining steps correctly to arrive at the total of 108 books.\n</thinking>\n\nThe correct answer is B, that Darla, Katie and Gary have a total of 108 books. Here's why:\n\nThe question states that Katie has half as many books as Darla. Since Darla has 6 books, half of that is 3 books for Katie. This is exactly what the explanation for answer B shows.\n\nIt then adds Darla's 6 books and Katie's 3 books to get their combined total of 9 books. \n\nNext, it multiplies this combined 9 books by 5, since the question says Gary has 5 times Darla and Katie's combined books. This gives Gary 45 books.\n\nFinally, summing Darla's 6, Katie's 3, and Gary's 45 gives the total of 108 books, as answer B states.\n\nIn contrast, answer A incorrectly calculates Katie as having 12 books, which is not half of Darla's 6 books as specified in the question. This throws off the rest of the calculation.\n\nTherefore, by properly following the information given in the question, we can confidently conclude that B's total of 108 books is correct, while A's is mistaken.",
