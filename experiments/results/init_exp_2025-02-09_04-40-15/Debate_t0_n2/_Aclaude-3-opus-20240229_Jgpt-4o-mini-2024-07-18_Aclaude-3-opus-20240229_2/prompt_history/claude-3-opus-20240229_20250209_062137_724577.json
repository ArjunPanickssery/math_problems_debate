Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How long the tree has already been planted (current age - age when planted)\n2. How many more years until it bears fruit (7 years total - years already planted) \n3. Lydia's age when it bears fruit (current age + additional years needed)\nThe question provides all the necessary information, so no additional tools are needed. The math_eval tool could be used to perform the final age calculation.\n</thinking>\n\nLydia planted the tree when she was 4 and is now 9. So the tree has already been growing for 9 - 4 = 5 years. \nAn apple tree takes 7 years total to bear fruit. Since Lydia's tree has already been growing 5 years, it only needs 7 - 5 = 2 more years.\nLydia is currently 9. In 2 more years when the tree bears fruit, she will be:",
