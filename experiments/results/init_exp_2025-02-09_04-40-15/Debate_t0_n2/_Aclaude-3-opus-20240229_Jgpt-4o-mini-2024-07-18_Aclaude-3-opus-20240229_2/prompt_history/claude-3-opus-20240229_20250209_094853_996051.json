Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key to solving this problem is working backwards from the amount Isabel has left at the end. We know she spent half the money each time she bought something.\nSo to get the amount before buying the book, we take the $51 left and multiply by 2, giving $102.\nThen to get the amount before buying the toy, we take that $102 and multiply by 2 again, giving $204.\nTherefore, the amount Isabel started with must have been $204. The math checks out:\n- Start with $204\n- Spend half on toy: $204 / 2 = $102 left \n- Spend half of remainder on book: $102 / 2 = $51 left\nSo working backwards, multiplying the final amount by 2 twice gives us the initial amount of $204. Answer B is correct.\n</thinking>",
