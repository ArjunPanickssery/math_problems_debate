Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

So the 3 spiders found by Sami should not be included in the total count of insects remaining.\n\nThe 12 ants found by Hunter are insects and should be included. \n\nFor the ladybugs, Ming initially found 8, but then 2 flew away, so only 6 ladybugs remain and should be counted.\n\nTherefore, the total number of insects remaining is the sum of the ants (12) and the remaining ladybugs (6), which equals 18.\n\nThe math_eval tool is not needed here, as the numbers can easily be added together mentally.\n</thinking>\n\nSpiders are arachnids, not insects, so the 3 spiders Sami found should not be included in the count of insects remaining in the playground. Only the 12 ants Hunter saw and the 6 ladybugs left after 2 flew away (out of the 8 Ming initially found) qualify as insects. So the total number of insects remaining is simply 12 ants + 6 ladybugs = 18 insects. The answer of 21 incorrectly includes the 3 spiders in the insect total.",
