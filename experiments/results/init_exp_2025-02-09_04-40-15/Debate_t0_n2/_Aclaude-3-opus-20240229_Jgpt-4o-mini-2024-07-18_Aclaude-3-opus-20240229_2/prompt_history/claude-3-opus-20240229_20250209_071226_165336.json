          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key point of contention seems to be whether we should calculate the cost for all 30 singers, or just the 18 additional robes that need to be purchased. \n\nTo argue for answer A being correct, I would focus on the fact that the question specifically asks how much the school will spend. The school already has 12 robes, so they only need to spend money to purchase the additional 18 robes required. Multiplying the $2 cost per robe by the 18 robes needed results in $36 total spend.\n\nI don't think any of the provided tools are necessary to make this argument. The question provides the key information - the school has 12 robes, needs 30 total, and each robe costs $2. Simple subtraction and multiplication is sufficient to calculate the amount the school needs to spend on the additional robes.\n</thinking>\n\nThe question asks specifically how much the school will spend on robes. We're told the school already has 12 robes, but needs a total of 30, one for each singer. To determine the spending, we only need to consider the additional robes that must be purchased.\n\nWith 30 singers total and 12 robes already owned, the school needs to buy 30 - 12 = 18 more robes. At a price of $2 per robe, purchasing these 18 robes will cost 18 * $2 = $36. \n\nSo the amount the school will spend is $36, making answer A correct. The $60 in answer B would be the total value of all 30 robes, but the school isn't spending that full amount since they already own 12 robes.",
