Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Maria is buying 3 dozens of flowers. \n\nTo calculate the total number of flowers Maria will have:\n1. Calculate the number of flowers in 3 dozens (without the free ones)\n   - This can be done by multiplying 3 dozens by 12 flowers per dozen\n2. Calculate the number of free flowers Maria gets for buying 3 dozens\n   - For each dozen, she gets 2 free flowers\n   - So for 3 dozens, she would get 3 * 2 = 6 free flowers\n3. Add the number of flowers bought to the number of free flowers\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations, but it's simple enough to do mentally. All the information needed is provided in the question.\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the question, Maria is buying 3 dozens of flowers, and each dozen contains 12 flowers. So the number of flowers she is actually buying is:",
