Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

We know that 20 years ago, Shane was twice Garret's current age. Since Garret is currently 12, that means 20 years ago Shane was 12 * 2 = 24 years old.\n\nNow that we know Shane's age 20 years ago, we need to add 20 years to that to get his current age. So Shane's current age would be calculated as:\n24 (Shane's age 20 years ago) + 20 (years passed) = 44 (Shane's current age)\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform this calculation and confirm the result is 44.\n</thinking>",
