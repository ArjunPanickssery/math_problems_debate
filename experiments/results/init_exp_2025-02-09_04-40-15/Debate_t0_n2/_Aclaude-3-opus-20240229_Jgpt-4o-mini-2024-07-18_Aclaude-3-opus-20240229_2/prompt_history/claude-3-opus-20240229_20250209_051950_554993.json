Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The usable length of each piece of rope after accounting for the 25% loss from lashing them together\n\nThe key piece of information that the (A) answer is missing is accounting for the 25% loss when lashing the ropes together. \n\nTo calculate the usable length per piece:\n- Original length per piece: 20 feet\n- Loss per piece: 20 * 0.25 = 5 feet\n- Usable length per piece: 20 - 5 = 15 feet\n\nWith the usable length of 15 feet per piece, we can calculate how many pieces are needed:\n- Total length needed: 60 feet \n- Pieces needed: 60 / 15 = 4 pieces\n\nThe (B) answer correctly goes through all these steps to arrive at the right answer of 4 pieces of rope needed.\n</thinking>",
