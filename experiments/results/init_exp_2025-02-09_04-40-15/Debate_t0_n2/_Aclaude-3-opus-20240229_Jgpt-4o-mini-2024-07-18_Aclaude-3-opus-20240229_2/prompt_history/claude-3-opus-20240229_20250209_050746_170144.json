Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nTo determine which answer is correct, I'll calculate the number of slightly used crayons step-by-step.\n\nGiven:\n- 120 total crayons\n- 1/3 are new\n- 20% are broken\n- The rest are slightly used\n\nCalculating new crayons:\n120 * (1/3) = 40 new crayons\n\nCalculating broken crayons:\nThere are two possible approaches:\n1. 20% of the total 120 crayons are broken\n2. 20% of the remaining crayons after removing the new ones are broken\n\nTo determine which is correct, I'll consider the phrasing \"20% are broken\". This implies 20% of the total, not 20% of a subset. So approach 1 is correct.\n\n120 * 0.20 = 24 broken crayons\n\nSlightly used crayons are the remainder:\n120 - 40 (new) - 24 (broken) = 56 slightly used\n\nTherefore, answer (A) 64 is incorrect. The correct number of slightly used crayons is 56, so answer (B) is correct.\n</thinking>\n\nAnswer (B) is correct. Here's why:\n\nThe question states that 20% of the total 120 crayons are broken, not 20% of the remaining crayons after removing the new ones. So we first calculate the number of new crayons, which is 120/3 = 40. Then we calculate 20% of the total 120 crayons that are broken: 120 * 0.20 = 24 broken crayons.\n\nThe slightly used crayons are what's left after removing the new and broken crayons from the total:\n120 - 40 (new) - 24 (broken) = 56 slightly used\n\nTherefore, the correct number of slightly used crayons is 56, making answer (B) correct. The calculation in answer (A) incorrectly applies the 20% broken to the remaining crayons after removing the new ones, rather than 20% of the total.",
