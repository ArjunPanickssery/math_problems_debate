Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

We can do this by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by the fraction that are red.\nOnce we have the total number of red jelly beans, we can then take 1/4 of that to determine the number of red jelly beans that are coconut flavored.\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations.
