If there are 75 total chickens, how many hens are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 67.0\nLet x represent the number of roosters\nNumber of hens:9x-5\nTotal:9x-5+x=75\n10x-5=75\n10x=80\nx=8\nNumber of hens: 9(8)-5=67\n#### 67\n(B): 68.0\nLet x represent the number of roosters\nNumber of hens: 9x+5\nTotal: 9x+5+x=75\n10x+5=75\n10x=70\nx=7\nNumber of hens: 9(7)+5=68\n#### 68</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe question asks how many hens are on the farm, given that there are 5 less than 9 times the number of roosters, and there are 75 total chickens.\n\nTo solve this, we can set up an equation letting x represent the number of roosters. The key is properly representing the number of hens in terms of x.\n\nMy assigned answer is (B), which states the number of hens is 9x+5. This matches the problem statement that there are \"5 less than 9 times the amount of hens as roosters\". If x is roosters, then 9x is 9 times the roosters, and subtracting 5 gives the number of hens.\n\nThe opponent's answer (A) incorrectly represents the number of hens as 9x-5. This would mean there are 5 more than 9 times the roosters, which is the opposite of what the question states.\n\nSo the equation should be:\nHens + Roosters = Total\n(9x+5) + x = 75\n\nThis can be solved for x to determine the number of roosters, and then 9x+5 will give the number of hens. No additional tools are needed, as basic algebra can solve the equation.\n</thinking>\n\nThe question clearly states that the number of hens is \"5 less than 9 times the amount of hens as roosters\". Let's break this down:\n\n- \"9 times the amount of hens as roosters\" means if there are x roosters, there are 9x hens\n- \"5 less than\" means we take that amount (9x) and subtract 5\n\nTherefore, the number of hens is represented by 9x+5, not 9x-5 as the opponent claims. \n\nUsing this, we can set up the equation:\n(9x+5) + x = 75\n\nThe left side represents the hens (9x+5) plus roosters (x), which the problem states totals 75.\n\nSolving this:\n10x + 5 = 75\n10x = 70\nx = 7 \n\nPlugging x=7 back in for the number of hens:\n9(7) + 5 = 68\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B), that there are 68 hens. The opponent's method of representing the hens as 9x-5 does not match the problem statement.\n\n</transcript>"

This means if there are x roosters, the number of hens is 9x-5, not 9x+5 as my opponent claims.\n\nWe can prove this logically:\n- \"9 times the amount of hens as roosters\" means if there are x roosters, there are 9x hens \n- \"5 less than\" that amount means we take 9x and subtract 5, giving 9x-5 hens\n\nAlgebraically, letting x be the number of roosters, the total number of chickens is:\nHens + Roosters = (9x-5) + x = 75 chickens\n\nSolving the equation:\n9x - 5 + x = 75\n10x - 5 = 75\n10x = 80\nx = 8 roosters\n\nPlugging x=8 back in for the number of hens: \n9(8) - 5 = 67 hens\n\nTherefore, answer A is correct that there are 67 hens. My opponent's argument that the hens should be represented by 9x+5 would mean there are 5 more than 9 times the roosters, which directly contradicts what the question states.",
