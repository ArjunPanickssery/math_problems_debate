Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

It provides Stu's number of books (9) and states that Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu.\n\nTo calculate the total, we need to:\n1. Calculate how many books Albert has by multiplying Stu's books by 4\n2. Add Stu's books and Albert's books together\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The required \"expr\" parameter can be inferred from the question text.\n\nFirst we'll calculate Albert's books with:\nexpr: 9 * 4\n\nThen we'll add Stu's books to get the total:  \nexpr: 36 + 9\n\nNo additional information is needed from the user to perform these calculations.\n</thinking>",
