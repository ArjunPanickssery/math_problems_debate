Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The number of toy soldiers he buys, which is twice the number of toy cars\n\nThe question directly states that James buys 20 toy cars. It also says he buys twice as many toy soldiers as toy cars. So we can calculate the number of toy soldiers as 2 * 20 = 40.\n\nTo get the total, we simply need to add the number of toy cars and toy soldiers:\n- Number of toy cars: 20 \n- Number of toy soldiers: 40\n- Total = 20 + 40 = 60\n\nWe have all the necessary information to calculate the total, so no additional tools are needed.\n</thinking>\n\nJames buys 20 toy cars and twice as many toy soldiers, which is 40 toy soldiers.
