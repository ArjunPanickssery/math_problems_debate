Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Subtract Jacob's calorie goal (1800) from his actual calories consumed to determine how many extra calories he ate\n\nMy assigned answer (B) follows these steps correctly:\n- It adds 400 + 900 + 1100 to get 2400 total calories \n- It subtracts the 1800 calorie goal from 2400 to determine Jacob ate 600 extra calories\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations and confirm the 600 calorie result is correct.\n\nThe other answer (A) makes a critical mistake in the second step - instead of subtracting the 1800 calorie goal, it adds it. This doesn't make sense logically for determining the excess calories.\n</thinking>",
