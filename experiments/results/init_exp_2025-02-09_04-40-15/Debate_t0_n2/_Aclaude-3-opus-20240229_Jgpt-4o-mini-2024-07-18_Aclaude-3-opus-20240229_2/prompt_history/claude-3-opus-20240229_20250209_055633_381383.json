Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The math_eval tool can also handle this addition.\n\nSo the key steps are:\n1. Use math_eval to calculate my dog's current age \n2. Use math_eval to add my dog's current age to my age when it was born\n\nNo additional information is needed from the user to perform these calculations.\n</thinking>",
