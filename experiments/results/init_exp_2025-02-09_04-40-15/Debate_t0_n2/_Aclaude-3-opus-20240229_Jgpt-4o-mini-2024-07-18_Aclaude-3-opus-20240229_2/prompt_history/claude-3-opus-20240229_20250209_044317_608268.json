Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The key information is:\n- The squat rack costs $2500\n- The barbell costs 1/10 as much as the squat rack\n\nTo calculate the total cost, we need to:\n1. Find the cost of the barbell by dividing the squat rack cost by 10\n2. Add the barbell cost to the squat rack cost\n\nThe math_eval tool can help with both of these steps. All the required information is provided in the question.\n</thinking>",
