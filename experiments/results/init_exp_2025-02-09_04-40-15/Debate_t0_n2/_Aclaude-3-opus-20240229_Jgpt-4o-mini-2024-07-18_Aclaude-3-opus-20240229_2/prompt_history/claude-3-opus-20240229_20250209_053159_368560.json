Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Divide the amount saved by the original price to get the percentage off\n\nThe original price and sale price are both given, so we have all the information needed. No additional tools are required.\n</thinking>\n\nAsia saved $350 - $140 = $210 on the dress by buying it on sale. To calculate the percentage off, we need to divide the amount saved by the original price, not the sale price. \n\n$210 saved / $350 original price = 0.60\n\n0.60 as a percentage is 60%. So Asia got the dress for 60% off the original price.\n\nThe other answer incorrectly divides the amount saved by the sale price instead of the original price, which does not give the percentage off.",
