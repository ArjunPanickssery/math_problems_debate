Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

To determine the total number of toys James buys, we need to:\n1. Calculate the number of toy soldiers James buys based on the number of toy cars\n2. Add the number of toy cars and toy soldiers together to get the total\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The required \"expr\" parameter can be inferred from the information given in the question.\n</thinking>",
