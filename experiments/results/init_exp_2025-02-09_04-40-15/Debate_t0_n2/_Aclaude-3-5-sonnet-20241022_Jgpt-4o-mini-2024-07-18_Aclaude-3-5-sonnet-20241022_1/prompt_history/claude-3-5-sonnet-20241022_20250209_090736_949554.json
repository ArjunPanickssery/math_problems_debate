Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The key to solving this problem correctly lies in maintaining unit consistency throughout the calculation. By converting the traveler's consumption to gallons first (32/128 = 0.25 gallons), we ensure accurate multiplication when calculating the camel's portion. This method avoids rounding errors that can occur when working with large numbers of ounces. The camel drank 1.75 gallons (7 \u00d7 0.25), and adding this to the traveler's 0.25 gallons gives us 2.75 gallons total. Converting to ounces and back to gallons, as done in answer B, introduces unnecessary steps that can lead to calculation errors.",
