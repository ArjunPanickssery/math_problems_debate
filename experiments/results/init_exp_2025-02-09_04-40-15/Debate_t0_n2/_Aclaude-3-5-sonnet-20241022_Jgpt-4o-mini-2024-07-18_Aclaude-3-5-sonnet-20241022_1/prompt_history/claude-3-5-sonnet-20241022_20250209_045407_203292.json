Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The question states \"5 more than half the cows are black,\" which means we need to take half of the total cows (18/2 = 9) and add 5 to get the number of black cows (14). This is a straightforward mathematical operation that directly follows the wording of the problem. Since there are 18 total cows and 14 black cows, there must be 4 non-black cows. Answer B incorrectly adds 5 to the total number of cows first, which doesn't match the problem statement. The phrase \"5 more than half\" clearly indicates we should add 5 to half of the existing cows, not create a new total.",
