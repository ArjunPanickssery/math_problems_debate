Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

      "content": "<question>QUESTION: John starts climbing a very steep hill.  He travels 1 foot vertically for every two feet horizontally.  His elevation increases from 100 feet to 1450 feet.  How far does he move horizontally, in feet?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2700.0\nHe travels 1450-100=1350 feet vertically\nSo he travels 1350*2=2700 feet horizontally\n#### 2700\n(B): 2900.0\nHe reaches an elevation of 1450 feet\nSince he moves 2 feet horizontally for each vertical foot, he travels 1450*2=2900 feet horizontally\n#### 2900</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe key is to understand that the total elevation of 1450 feet represents the absolute height John reaches, not just the change in elevation. When calculating horizontal distance using the 2:1 ratio, we must use the total elevation of 1450 feet, not the difference. This is because the ratio applies to the total vertical distance covered, regardless of starting point. Therefore, since John moves 2 feet horizontally for every 1 foot vertically, and he reaches a height of 1450 feet, the horizontal distance is 1450 \u00d7 2 = 2900 feet. The other answer incorrectly subtracts the starting elevation before applying the ratio.\n\n</transcript>"

Think about it: if John started at 99 feet elevation instead of 100 feet, would he suddenly need to travel much further horizontally? That's illogical. The correct approach is to calculate the vertical distance traveled (1450 - 100 = 1350 feet), then apply the 2:1 ratio. Let me demonstrate:",
