Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If Haley has 5 more necklaces than Jason, then Jason must have 20 necklaces (25 - 5 = 20). This is because we subtract 5 from Haley's total to get Jason's amount. Since Josh has half of Jason's necklaces, Josh must have 10 necklaces (20 \u00f7 2 = 10). Therefore, to find how many more necklaces Haley has than Josh, we subtract Josh's necklaces from Haley's: 25 - 10 = 15. The answer must be 15 necklaces.\n\n</transcript>"
