Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The key to this problem lies in correctly interpreting the phrase \"3 fewer 8 string guitars than the normal guitars.\" Since there are 6 normal guitars, we need 6-3=3 fewer 8-string guitars, meaning we need 6 eight-string guitars total. This makes logical sense because if we had only 3 eight-string guitars, we would be reducing the number itself by 3, not the difference between the two quantities. The problem is asking for the difference in the count of guitars, not a direct subtraction from the number of normal guitars. Therefore, we need 12 strings for basses, 36 strings for normal guitars, and 48 strings (6 guitars \u00d7 8 strings) for eight-string guitars, totaling 96 strings.",
