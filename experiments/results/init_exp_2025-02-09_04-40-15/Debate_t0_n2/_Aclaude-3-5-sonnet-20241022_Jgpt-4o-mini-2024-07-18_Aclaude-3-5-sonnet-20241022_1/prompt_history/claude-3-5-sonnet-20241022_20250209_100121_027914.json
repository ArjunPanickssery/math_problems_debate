Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The calculation in answer B is the correct approach because it considers both the change in hourly rate AND the change in weekly hours worked. James isn't just getting a raise in his hourly rate; he's also working 15 more hours per week. We need to calculate his total weekly earnings at both jobs (new job: $20 \u00d7 40 = $800; old job: $16 \u00d7 25 = $400) and then find the difference ($400 per week). Multiplying this difference by 52 weeks gives us $20,800 more per year. Answer A only accounts for the hourly rate increase and ignores the crucial fact that James is working more hours.",
