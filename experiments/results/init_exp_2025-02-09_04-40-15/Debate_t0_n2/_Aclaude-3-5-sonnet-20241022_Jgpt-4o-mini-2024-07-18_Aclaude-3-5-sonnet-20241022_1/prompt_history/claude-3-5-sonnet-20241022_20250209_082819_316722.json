Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The question clearly states that Brianne saves \"twice as much as her previous month's savings.\" This means we multiply the previous month's amount by 2, not add to it. Starting with $10 in January, we multiply by 2 each month: February is $20, March is $40, April is $80, and May is $160. The opponent's calculation incorrectly assumes we're adding the doubled amount to the previous total, which isn't what the question asks. The phrase \"saves twice as much\" specifically refers to doubling the individual monthly amount, not the cumulative savings.",
