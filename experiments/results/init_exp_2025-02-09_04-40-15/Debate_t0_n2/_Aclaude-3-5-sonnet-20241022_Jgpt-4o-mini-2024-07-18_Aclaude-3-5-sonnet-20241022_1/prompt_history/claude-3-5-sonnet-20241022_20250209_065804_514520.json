Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The calculation is straightforward: there are 30 red bowling balls, and 6 more green ones than red, meaning 36 green bowling balls. The total is simply the sum of red and green balls: 30 + 36 = 66 bowling balls. The opponent's answer incorrectly adds the number 6 an extra time at the end of their calculation. This is a mathematical error because the \"+6\" was already accounted for when calculating the number of green balls (30 + 6 = 36). Adding it again amounts to double-counting and leads to an inflated total.",
