Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The more logical interpretation is that pants cost $33 each (2 pairs = $66) and shirts cost $54 each (4 shirts = $216). This makes more sense because pants are typically less expensive than shirts, especially considering these might be high-quality dress shirts versus casual pants. The total cost would be $282, and since Laura only gave $250, she would be $32 short. This explains the negative change value of -$32, indicating she still owes money.\n\n</transcript>"
