Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many packs did he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 360.0\nJohn has 6*30=180 students\nSo he bought 180*2=360 packs\n#### 360\n(A): 12.0\nCalculate number of classes: 6\nMultiply by 2 packs per class: 6*2=12\n#### 12</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe question clearly states that John buys 2 packs of index cards for \"all his students.\" This means each individual student receives 2 packs. With 6 classes and 30 students per class, there are 180 total students (6 \u00d7 30 = 180). Since each student gets 2 packs, we multiply 180 students by 2 packs per student, resulting in 360 total packs. This interpretation aligns with the natural reading of \"for all his students\" - meaning each student receives their own set of index cards, which makes sense for individual student use in class activities or note-taking.\n\n</transcript>"
