Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many strings does he need?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 72.0\nThe basses take 3*4=12 strings\nHe restrings 2*3=6 normal guitars\nThat takes 6*6=36 strings\nHe restrings 6-3=3 guitars with 8 strings\nSo that uses 3*8=24 strings\nSo he uses 12+36+24=72 strings\n#### 72\n(B): 96.0\nThe basses take 3*4=12 strings\nHe restrings 2*3=6 normal guitars\nThat takes 6*6=36 strings\nFor 8-string guitars, we need 6 guitars\nSo that uses 6*8=48 strings\nSo he uses 12+36+48=96 strings\n#### 96</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe key to this problem lies in carefully interpreting the phrase \"3 fewer 8 string guitars than the normal guitars.\" Since there are 6 normal guitars, we need 3 (which is 3 fewer than 6) eight-string guitars, not 6 as suggested in answer B. Let's break it down:\n- 3 basses \u00d7 4 strings = 12 strings\n- 6 guitars \u00d7 6 strings = 36 strings\n- 3 eight-string guitars \u00d7 8 strings = 24 strings\n\nThe total is therefore 72 strings (12 + 36 + 24). Answer B incorrectly assumes we need 6 eight-string guitars, which leads to an inflated total. The problem clearly states we need 3 fewer eight-string guitars than normal guitars, making 72 the correct answer.\n\n</transcript>"
