Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many total toys does he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nHe buys 2*20=40 toy cars\nSo the total number of toys is 20+40=60\n#### 60\n(A): 40.0\nHe buys twice as many toy soldiers as cars\nThis means he buys 2*20=40 toy soldiers\nThis is the total number of toys\n#### 40</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe total number of toys must be 60 because we need to count both the toy soldiers and the toy cars. James buys 20 toy cars, and twice as many toy soldiers, which means 40 toy soldiers (2 \u00d7 20 = 40). To find the total number of toys, we must add the number of toy cars (20) to the number of toy soldiers (40), giving us 60 toys in total (20 + 40 = 60). This is basic addition - we can't ignore either type of toy when counting the total.\n\n</transcript>"
