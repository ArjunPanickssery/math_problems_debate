Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

      "content": "<question>QUESTION: June made a design with 20 equal tiles. Three tiles are yellow and the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles. Six tiles are purple and the remaining tiles are white.  How many white tiles are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 7.0\nThere are 3 + 1 = 4 blue tiles.\nThere are a total of 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 tiles are yellow, blue, and purple.\nHence, 20 - 13 = 7 tiles are white.\n#### 7\n(B): 10.0\nThe yellow and blue tiles together total 3 + 1 = 4 tiles.\nAdding the purple tiles gives us 4 + 6 = 10 colored tiles.\nTherefore, 20 - 10 = 10 tiles must be white.\n#### 10</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe question states that \"the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles.\" This means there are 4 blue tiles (3+1=4), but these are separate from the yellow tiles. So we have 3 yellow tiles AND 4 blue tiles, making a total of 7 tiles between yellow and blue. Adding the 6 purple tiles gives us 13 colored tiles (7+6=13). Therefore, out of the total 20 tiles, the remaining white tiles must be 20-13=7 tiles. The opponent's interpretation incorrectly combines the yellow and blue tiles as a total of 4, which contradicts the clear statement that blue tiles are \"one more than\" the yellow tiles, not including them.\n\n</transcript>"
