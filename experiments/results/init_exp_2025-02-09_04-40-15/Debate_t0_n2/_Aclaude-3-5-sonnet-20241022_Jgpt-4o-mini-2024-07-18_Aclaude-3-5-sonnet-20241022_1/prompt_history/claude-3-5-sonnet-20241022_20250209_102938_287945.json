Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How much does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50\n(A): 100.0\nFirst calculate what fraction remains: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\nSince 2/3 was spent, multiply $150 by 2/3: $150 * (2/3) = $100\nThis is the amount she has left.\n#### 100</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe question clearly asks how much money the housewife has left after spending 2/3 of her money. When we calculate 2/3 of $150, we get $100, which is the amount she spent. This $100 represents the portion that remains in her possession after the transaction. Think about it logically - if she started with $150 and spent a smaller portion (2/3) than the whole amount, she must have more than $50 left. The calculation showing she spent $100 (2/3 of $150) directly tells us this is her remaining amount, as spending money means keeping that portion, while the rest goes to the market.\n\n</transcript>"
