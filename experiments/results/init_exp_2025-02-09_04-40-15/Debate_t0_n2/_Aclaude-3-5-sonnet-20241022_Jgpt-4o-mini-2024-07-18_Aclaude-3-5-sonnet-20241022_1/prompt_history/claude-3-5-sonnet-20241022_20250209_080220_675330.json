Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The key to this problem lies in understanding the relationships between the three people's silver dollar counts. The question states that Mr. Ha owns 5 more than Mr. Phung, not 5 more than Mr. Chiu. Therefore, Mr. Ha's total should be calculated as Mr. Phung's amount (72) plus 5, which equals 77. This would lead to an incorrect total of 205. The correct calculation should be Mr. Chiu's 56 plus Mr. Phung's 72 plus Mr. Ha's 61 (which is Mr. Chiu's 56 plus 5), totaling 189 silver dollars. The wording clearly indicates that each comparison is relative to the previously mentioned person, not to Mr. Chiu.",
