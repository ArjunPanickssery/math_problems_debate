Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

This is basic multiplication - if something is \"times\" another number, we multiply. The phrase \"4 times as many\" is a clear mathematical instruction to multiply by 4, not to add 4 books per book. To find the total books between them, we add Stu's 9 books to Albert's 36 books, giving us 45 books total. This is straightforward multiplication and addition following standard mathematical conventions.\n\n</transcript>"
