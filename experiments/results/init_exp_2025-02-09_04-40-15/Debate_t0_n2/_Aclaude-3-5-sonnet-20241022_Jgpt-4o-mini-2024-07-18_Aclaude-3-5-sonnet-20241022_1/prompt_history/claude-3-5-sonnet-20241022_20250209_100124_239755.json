Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

When we say something is \"less than\" another value, we subtract. The correct algebraic expression for the number of hens is 9x-5, where x is the number of roosters. This leads to the equation 9x-5+x=75 (total chickens equals hens plus roosters). Solving this gives us x=8 roosters, and therefore 9(8)-5=67 hens. The opposing solution incorrectly interprets \"5 less than\" as addition, which fundamentally misrepresents the mathematical relationship stated in the problem.\n\n</transcript>"

The natural interpretation is that we start with 9 times the roosters and then add 5, as this follows the left-to-right reading order of the phrase. Let's verify mathematically: With 7 roosters and 68 hens, we can check that 68 is indeed 5 less than 9 times the roosters, because:",
