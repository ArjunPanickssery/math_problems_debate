Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked, how many apples did Kayla pick?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 274.0\nLet x be the number of apples Kylie picked\nKayla picked 10+4x apples\n340=x+(10+4x)\n340=5x+10\n330=5x\nx=66 apples\nKayla picked 10+4(66)=274 apples\n#### 274\n(B): 280\nLet x be the number of apples Kylie picked\nKayla picked 4(x+10) apples\n340=x+4(x+10)\n340=x+4x+40\n340=5x+40\n300=5x\nx=60 apples\nKayla picked 4(60+10)=4(70)=280 apples\n#### 280</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe key to this problem lies in correctly interpreting the phrase \"10 more than 4 times the amount.\" This should be written algebraically as (4x + 10), where x is Kylie's amount. The equation is NOT 4(x+10), as that would mean \"4 times (the amount plus 10),\" which is a different mathematical expression. When we solve using the correct interpretation (4x + 10), we get x = 66 apples for Kylie, and therefore Kayla picked 4(66) + 10 = 274 apples. This aligns with the original wording of \"10 more than 4 times the amount\" because we multiply first, then add 10.\n\n</transcript>"
