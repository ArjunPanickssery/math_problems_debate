Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The question states \"John buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students,\" but this doesn't mean each student gets 2 packs. The key phrase \"for all his students\" suggests he's buying 2 packs to share among all students in each class. This is a reasonable interpretation because index cards are often distributed as needed rather than given to each student individually. Therefore, John would need 2 packs per class, and with 6 classes, he needs 12 packs total. This interpretation is more realistic and cost-effective than buying 360 packs, which would be an excessive amount of index cards for a typical classroom setting.",
