Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

For example, if something is \"3 less than 10,\" we write \"10-3.\" Therefore, \"5 less than 9 times the roosters\" means \"9x-5.\" However, this is not what the question asks. It asks for \"5 less than 9 times,\" which means we take 9 times the roosters and then subtract 5, giving us 9x+5. This leads to the equation 10x+5=75, giving us x=7 roosters and 68 hens.\n\n</transcript>"
