Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The calculation must be done separately for each set of 100 matches because they represent distinct periods with different win rates. In the first 100 matches, Sam won 50 matches (50% of 100). In the next 100 matches, he won 60 matches (60% of 100). To find the total wins, we simply add these together: 50 + 60 = 110 matches. Answer A incorrectly assumes the 60% win rate applies to all matches, but this is mathematically impossible given the information provided. We know explicitly that the first 100 matches had a 50% win rate, so applying 60% to all matches contradicts the given data.",
