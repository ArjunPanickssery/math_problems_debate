Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

      "content": "<question>QUESTION: June made a design with 20 equal tiles. Three tiles are yellow and the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles. Six tiles are purple and the remaining tiles are white.  How many white tiles are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 7.0\nThere are 3 + 1 = 4 blue tiles.\nThere are a total of 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 tiles are yellow, blue, and purple.\nHence, 20 - 13 = 7 tiles are white.\n#### 7\n(B): 10.0\nThe yellow and blue tiles together total 3 + 1 = 4 tiles.\nAdding the purple tiles gives us 4 + 6 = 10 colored tiles.\nTherefore, 20 - 10 = 10 tiles must be white.\n#### 10</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe key to this problem lies in carefully interpreting the statement \"the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles.\" This means we have 3 yellow tiles, and the number of blue tiles is 4 (one more than 3). We must count these separately, not combine them as answer B incorrectly does. So we have 3 yellow tiles, 4 blue tiles, and 6 purple tiles, making a total of 13 colored tiles. Since there are 20 tiles in total, subtracting 13 from 20 gives us 7 white tiles. Answer B makes the critical error of treating \"one more than yellow\" as just adding 1 to the total, rather than having 4 separate blue tiles.\n\n</transcript>"
