Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

      "content": "<question>QUESTION: Mr. Ha owns 5 more silver dollars than Mr. Phung. Mr. Phung has 16 more silver dollars than Mr. Chiu has. If Mr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars, how many silver dollars the three have in total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 205.0\nMr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars.\nIf Mr. Phung has 16 more silver dollars than Mr. Chiu, then his total silver dollars is 56+16 = 72\nThe total number of silver dollars that Mr. Ha owns is 72 +5= 77\nCombined, together they have 77+72+56 = 205 silver dollars\n#### 205\n(B): 189.0\nMr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars.\nMr. Phung has 16 more silver dollars than Mr. Chiu, so he has 56+16 = 72 silver dollars\nMr. Ha has 5 more silver dollars, so his total is 56+5 = 61 silver dollars\nTogether they have 72+61+56 = 189 silver dollars\n#### 189</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe key to this problem lies in understanding the relative relationships between the three people's silver dollar counts. When it states \"Mr. Ha owns 5 more silver dollars than Mr. Phung,\" this means we must add 5 to Mr. Phung's total of 72 silver dollars to get Mr. Ha's amount (77). The problem establishes a clear chain: Mr. Ha has 5 more than Mr. Phung, who has 16 more than Mr. Chiu. Therefore, we must first calculate Mr. Phung's total (72) and then add 5 to get Mr. Ha's amount (77). Adding all three totals (77 + 72 + 56) gives us 205 silver dollars, which is the correct total.\n\n</transcript>"
