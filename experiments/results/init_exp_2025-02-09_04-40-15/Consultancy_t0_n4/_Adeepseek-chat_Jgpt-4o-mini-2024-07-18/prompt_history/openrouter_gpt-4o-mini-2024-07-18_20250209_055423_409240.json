If she has $51 left, how much money, in dollars, did she have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 204.0\nAfter buying the toy, Isabel has 51*2=102 dollars left.\nIsabel had 102*2=204 dollars at first.\n#### 204\n(A): 408.0\nWorking backwards from what's left:\n51 * 2 = 102 is the previous amount\n102 * 2 = 204 is the amount before that\n204 * 2 = 408 was the initial amount\n#### 408\n"
