      "content": "QUESTION: A farm has 5 less than 9 times the amount of hens as roosters.  If there are 75 total chickens, how many hens are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 67.0\nLet x represent the number of roosters\nNumber of hens:9x-5\nTotal:9x-5+x=75\n10x-5=75\n10x=80\nx=8\nNumber of hens: 9(8)-5=67\n#### 67\n(B): 68.0\nLet x represent the number of roosters\nNumber of hens: 9x+5\nTotal: 9x+5+x=75\n10x+5=75\n10x=70\nx=7\nNumber of hens: 9(7)+5=68\n#### 68\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the relationship between the number of hens and roosters as described in the problem?\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe problem states that the farm has \"5 less than 9 times the amount of hens as roosters.\" This directly translates to the equation for the number of hens as \\(9x - 5\\), where \\(x\\) is the number of roosters. The total number of chickens is given as 75, so we set up the equation \\(9x - 5 + x = 75\\). Simplifying, we get \\(10x - 5 = 75\\), leading to \\(10x = 80\\) and \\(x = 8\\). Substituting back, the number of hens is \\(9(8) - 5 = 67\\). This calculation is consistent with the problem's description, making (A) the correct answer.\n"
