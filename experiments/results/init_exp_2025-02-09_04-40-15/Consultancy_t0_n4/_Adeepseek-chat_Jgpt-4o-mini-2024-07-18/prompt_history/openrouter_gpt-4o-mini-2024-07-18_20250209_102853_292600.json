      "content": "QUESTION: Sam has 18 cows.  5 more than half the cows are black.  How many cows are not black?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 4.0\nHalf of the cows: 18/2=9\nBlack cows: 5+9=14\n18-14=4 cows\n#### 4\n(B): 6\nTotal cows plus 5: 18+5 = 23\nHalf of 23 (rounded): 12\nThese are black cows\nNon-black cows: 18-12 = 6\n#### 6\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many black cows are there according to the first answer? \n\nWhat is the method used to calculate the number of black cows in the second answer? \n\nCan you clarify how \"half the cows\" is defined in the context of the problem? \n\nWhat is the total number of cows given in the question? \n\nIs the statement \"5 more than half the cows are black\" clear in its meaning? \n\nHow would you interpret \"5 more than half the cows\" in a mathematical equation? \n\nAre there any other interpretations of the problem that could lead to different answers? \n\nWhat do you think is the most straightforward way to approach this problem?\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct answer is (A): 4.0. The problem states that \"5 more than half the cows are black.\" Half of 18 cows is 9. Adding 5 to this gives 14 black cows. Subtracting 14 from the total of 18 cows leaves 4 cows that are not black. This interpretation directly follows the wording of the problem and provides a clear, logical solution. The second answer incorrectly adds 5 to the total number of cows before taking half, which misinterprets the problem's instructions. Therefore, the first method is the accurate and straightforward approach.\n"
