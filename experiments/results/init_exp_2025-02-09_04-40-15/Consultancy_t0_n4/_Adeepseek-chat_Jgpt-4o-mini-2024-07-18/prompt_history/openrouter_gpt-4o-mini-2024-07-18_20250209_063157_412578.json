How many pieces of rope will he need to buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet\nHe loses 20*.25=5 feet each time\nSo he gets 20-5=15 feet from each piece\nThat means he needs 60/15=4 pieces of rope\n#### 4\n(A): 3.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet of rope total\nEach piece of rope is 20 feet\nTherefore he needs 60/20=3 pieces of rope\n#### 3\n"
