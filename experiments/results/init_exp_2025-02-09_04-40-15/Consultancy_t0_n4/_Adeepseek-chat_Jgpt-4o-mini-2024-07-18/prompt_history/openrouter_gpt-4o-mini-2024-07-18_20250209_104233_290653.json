      "content": "QUESTION: James buys 3 CDs.  Two of them are 1.5 hours each.  The last one is twice that long.  What is the combined length of the CDs?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 6.0\nThe long CD is 1.5*2=3 hours\nThe two shorter CDs have a combined length of 1.5*2=3 hours\nSo in total the CDs had a length of 3+3= 6 hours\n#### 6\n(B): 4.5\nThe long CD is 1.5*2=3 hours\nThe short CDs have a length of 1.5 hours\nSo in total the CDs had a length of 3+1.5=4.5 hours\n#### 4.5\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the length of each of the two shorter CDs? Is it confirmed that they are both 1.5 hours? \n\nIs the last CD definitely twice the length of the shorter CDs? \n\nCan you clarify how you calculated the total length of the CDs? \n\nAre there any additional factors or considerations that might affect the total length calculation?\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct answer is (A): 6.0. The question clearly states that James buys 3 CDs, with two of them being 1.5 hours each. The last CD is twice as long as the shorter ones, which means it is 3 hours long. To find the combined length, we add the durations of all three CDs: 1.5 + 1.5 + 3 = 6 hours. The calculation in (A) is accurate and aligns with the information provided in the question. There is no ambiguity or missing information that would justify a different total length. Therefore, the combined length of the CDs is 6 hours.\n"
