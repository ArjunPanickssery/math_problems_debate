      "content": "QUESTION: Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. If Mabel has 85 marbles, how many more marbles does Mabel have than Amanda?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 63.0\nKatrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles.\nTwice as many marbles as Katrina is 17 x 2 = 34\nAmanda has 34 -12 = 22 marbles.\nMabel has 85 - 22 = 63 more marbles than Amanda\n#### 63\n(B): 39.0\nKatrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles\nAmanda will have 17 \u00d7 2 + 12 = 46 marbles\nMabel has 85 - 46 = 39 more marbles than Amanda\n#### 39\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many marbles does Katrina have?  \nWhat is the relationship between Amanda's marbles and Katrina's marbles?  \nIf Mabel has 85 marbles, how many marbles does Katrina have based on that information?  \nHow do you calculate the number of marbles Amanda has based on the information provided?  \nWhat is the final calculation to determine how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda?  \nCan you confirm the steps leading to the conclusion for both possible answers?  \n\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe key insight is that Amanda needs 12 MORE marbles to have twice as many as Katrina, meaning she currently has fewer than twice Katrina's amount. Since Mabel has 85 marbles and that's 5 times Katrina's amount, Katrina must have 17 marbles. Therefore, twice Katrina's amount would be 34 marbles. Since Amanda needs 12 more to reach that number, she must currently have 22 marbles (34 - 12 = 22). The difference between Mabel's 85 marbles and Amanda's 22 marbles is 63, making answer A correct. The error in answer B is assuming Amanda will have 46 marbles, when the question asks about her current amount.\n"
