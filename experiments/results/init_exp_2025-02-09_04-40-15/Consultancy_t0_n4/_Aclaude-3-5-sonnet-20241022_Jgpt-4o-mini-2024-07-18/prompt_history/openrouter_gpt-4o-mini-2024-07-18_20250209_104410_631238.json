      "content": "QUESTION: Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's hair. Emily\u2019s hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's hair. If Logan hair is 20 inches, how many inches is Kate\u2019s hair?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 7.0\nEmily\u2019s hair is 20-6 = 14 inches long.\nKate's hair 14/2= 7 inches long.\n#### 7\n(A): 13\nEmily's hair is 20+6 = 26 inches long.\nKate's hair is 26/2 = 13 inches long.\n#### 13\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the length of Emily's hair based on Logan's hair being 20 inches?\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nEmily's hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's, so we must add 6 to Logan's 20 inches, giving Emily 26 inches of hair. Since Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's, we simply divide 26 by 2, resulting in 13 inches for Kate's hair. The key is recognizing that \"longer than\" means we add the difference, not subtract it. The relationship between the lengths must maintain this positive difference. Answer B incorrectly subtracts 6 inches, which would make Emily's hair shorter than Logan's, contradicting the given information.\n"
