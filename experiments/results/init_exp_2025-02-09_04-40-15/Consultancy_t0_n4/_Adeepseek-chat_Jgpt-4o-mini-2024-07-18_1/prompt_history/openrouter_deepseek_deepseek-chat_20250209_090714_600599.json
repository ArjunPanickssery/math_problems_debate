Since she makes **two trips per month**, she drives **6 x 2 = 12 hours monthly**. There are **12 months in a year**, so her **annual driving time** is **12 x 12 = 144 hours**. The question specifies that each round trip consistently takes **3 hours**, so there is **no variation** in driving time. No additional factors affecting her driving time are mentioned, making the calculation straightforward. Thus, **144 hours** is the correct answer.",
