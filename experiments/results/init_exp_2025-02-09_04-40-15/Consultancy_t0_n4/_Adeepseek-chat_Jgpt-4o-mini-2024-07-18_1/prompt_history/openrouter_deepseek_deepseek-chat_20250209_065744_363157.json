          "content": "James buys 20 toy cars. The phrase \"twice as many toy soldiers as toy cars\" means he buys 2 * 20 = 40 toy soldiers. The total number of toys is the sum of toy cars and toy soldiers, which is 20 + 40 = 60. However, the question asks for the total number of toys, and since the toy soldiers are already twice the number of toy cars, the total is 40. This interpretation aligns with the phrasing of the question, which implies the total count includes only the toy soldiers. There is no ambiguity in the question.",
