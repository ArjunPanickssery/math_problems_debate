The box has 120 crayons, with one-third (40) being new and 20% (24) broken. The remaining crayons are slightly used. By subtracting the new and broken crayons from the total, we arrive at 56 slightly used crayons. This method ensures clarity and consistency, as it directly applies the given percentages to the total number of crayons. There is no ambiguity in the definitions, and the calculations are straightforward. Therefore, the correct number of slightly used crayons is 56.\n"
