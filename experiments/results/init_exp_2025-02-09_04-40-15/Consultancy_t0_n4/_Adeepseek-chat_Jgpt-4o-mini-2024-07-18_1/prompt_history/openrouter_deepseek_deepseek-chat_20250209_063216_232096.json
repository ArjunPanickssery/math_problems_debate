The Miami Heat's total games won is indeed the Bulls' total plus 5, which equals 75. There is no additional information or rules that affect this calculation. The question is straightforward, and the context does not change the interpretation. Therefore, the total games won by both teams is 70 (Bulls) + 75 (Heat) = 145. The answer is clearly 145.",
