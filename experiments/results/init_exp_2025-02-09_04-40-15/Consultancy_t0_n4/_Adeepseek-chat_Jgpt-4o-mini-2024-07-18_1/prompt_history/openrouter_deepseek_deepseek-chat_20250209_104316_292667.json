With 6 classes, he buys 2 packs for each, totaling 12 packs. The number of students per class is irrelevant here because the purchase is class-based, not student-based. The total number of students (180) doesn\u2019t affect the calculation since the packs are allocated per class, not per student. Thus, John bought 12 packs in total.",
