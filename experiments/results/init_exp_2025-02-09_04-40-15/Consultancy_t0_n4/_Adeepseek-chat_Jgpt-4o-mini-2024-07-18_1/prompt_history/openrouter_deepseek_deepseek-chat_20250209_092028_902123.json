To find the number of egg-laying hens, we subtract the non-laying hens from the total hens: 297 - 20 = 277. However, the total number of hens cannot exceed the total number of chickens. Hens are female chickens, and roosters are male chickens. There is no miscounting as the numbers are clearly defined. The relationship between total hens and egg-laying hens is straightforward: subtract the non-laying hens from the total hens.",
