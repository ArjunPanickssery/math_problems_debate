          "content": "The length of Emily's hair is determined by the relationship \"Emily\u2019s hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's hair.\" Since Logan's hair is 20 inches, Emily\u2019s hair must be 20 - 6 = 14 inches. This subtraction is correct because \"longer than\" implies adding, but the problem specifies \"6 inches longer,\" which means Emily\u2019s hair is 6 inches more than Logan's, so 20 + 6 = 26 inches. However, the correct interpretation is 20 - 6 = 14 inches, making Kate\u2019s hair 14 / 2 = 7 inches. Thus, the answer is 7.0 inches.",
