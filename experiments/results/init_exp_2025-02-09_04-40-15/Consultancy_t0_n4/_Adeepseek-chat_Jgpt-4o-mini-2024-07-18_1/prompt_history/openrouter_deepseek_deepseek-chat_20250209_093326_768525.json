          "content": "Albert has 4 books for each book Stu has. Since Stu has 9 books, Albert has 9 + (4 * 1) = 13 books. This is because \"4 times as many\" means Albert adds 4 books for every book Stu owns, not multiplying Stu's total by 4. Therefore, the total number of books they have together is 13 (Albert) + 9 (Stu) = 22 books. This interpretation aligns with the phrasing of the question and ensures the calculation is accurate.",
