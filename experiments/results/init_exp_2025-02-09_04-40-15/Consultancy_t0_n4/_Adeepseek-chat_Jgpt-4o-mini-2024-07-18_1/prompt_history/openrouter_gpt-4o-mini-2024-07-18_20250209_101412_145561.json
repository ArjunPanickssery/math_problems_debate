      "content": "QUESTION: For every one dozen flowers bought, a customer gets 2 free flowers. If Maria wants to buy 3 dozens flowers, how many pieces of flowers will she have in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 42.0\nMaria has 3 x 2 = 6 free flowers from buying 3 dozens flowers.\nSince each dozen is equal to 12, then Maria bought 3 x 12 = 36 flowers.\nHence, she has a total of 36 + 6 = 42 flowers.\n#### 42\n(B): 44.0\nFirst calculating the regular flowers: 3 x 12 = 36 flowers\nAdding the free flowers for each dozen: 36 + (3 x 2) = 42 flowers\nAdding the free flowers for the total purchase: 42 + 2 = 44 flowers\n#### 44\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many flowers does Maria receive for each dozen purchased?  \nWhat is the total number of dozens Maria is buying?  \nHow many flowers does Maria get for free when she buys 3 dozens?  \nWhat is the total number of flowers in one dozen?  \nWhat is the formula for calculating the total number of flowers including the free ones?  \nIs there any additional information that might affect the total count of flowers?  \nCan you confirm if the free flowers are given per dozen or per total purchase?  \nAre there any discrepancies in the calculations provided in the possible answers?\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nMaria receives 2 free flowers for each dozen purchased. She is buying 3 dozens, so she gets 3 x 2 = 6 free flowers. Each dozen contains 12 flowers, so she buys 3 x 12 = 36 flowers. The formula for the total number of flowers is the sum of purchased and free flowers: 36 + 6 = 42. The free flowers are given per dozen, not per total purchase. There are no discrepancies in the calculations provided in answer (A). Therefore, Maria will have a total of 42 flowers.\n"
