          "content": "The relationship is clearly defined: Kayla picked **10 more than 4 times** the number of apples Kylie picked. If Kylie picked \\( x \\) apples, then Kayla picked \\( 10 + 4x \\) apples. This directly translates to the equation \\( 340 = x + (10 + 4x) \\), which simplifies to \\( 340 = 5x + 10 \\). Solving this, we find \\( x = 66 \\), and Kayla picked \\( 10 + 4(66) = 274 \\) apples. This aligns perfectly with the problem statement and leads to the correct answer of **274**.",
