Since Mike and Rita are two of the three individuals, their combined total is 4 (Mike) + 4 (Rita) = 8 bars. The sharing method is explicitly stated to be equal, meaning no person receives more or less than the others. There are no leftover bars because 12 is perfectly divisible by 3. \"Shared equally\" means each person gets the same number of bars. Therefore, Mike and Rita together receive 8 bars.",
