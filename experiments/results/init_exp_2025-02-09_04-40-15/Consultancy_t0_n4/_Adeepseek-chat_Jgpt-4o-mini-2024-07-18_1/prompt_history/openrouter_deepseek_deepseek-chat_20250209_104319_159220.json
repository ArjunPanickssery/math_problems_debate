His old job paid $16 per hour for 25 hours a week, so he earned $16 * 25 = $400 weekly. The difference in weekly earnings is $800 - $400 = $400. Since he works 52 weeks a year, the total annual difference is $400 * 52 = $20,800. This calculation clearly shows the additional income Jame earns in his new job compared to his old one.",
