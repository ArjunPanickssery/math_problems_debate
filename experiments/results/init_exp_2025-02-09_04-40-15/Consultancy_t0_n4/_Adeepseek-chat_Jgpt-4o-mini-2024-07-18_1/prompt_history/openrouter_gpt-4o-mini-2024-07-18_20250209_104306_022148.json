      "content": "QUESTION: In the engineering department, 70% of the students are men and 180 are women. How many men are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 420.0\nThe percentage for women is 100% - 70% = 30%.\nSince 180 represents 30%, then 180/30 = 6 students represent 1%.\nHence, 6 x 70 = 420 students are men.\n#### 420\n(B): 126\nSince 70% of students are men, we can find the number by taking 70% of 180:\n180 \u00d7 0.7 = 126 men in the department.\n#### 126\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total number of students in the engineering department?  \nHow do you calculate the total number of students based on the percentage of men and women?  \nCan you confirm the relationship between the number of women and the total number of students?  \nIs there a formula to determine the number of men based on the percentage and the number of women?  \nHow do you derive the number of men from the percentage of men in relation to the number of women?  \nWhat is the correct interpretation of the percentages given in this context?  \nAre there any common mistakes made in similar percentage problems?\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe total number of students in the engineering department is 180 women plus the number of men. Since 70% of the students are men, we can calculate the number of men by taking 70% of the total number of women, which is 180. This gives us 180 \u00d7 0.7 = 126 men. The relationship between the number of women and the total number of students is that women make up 30% of the total, and men make up 70%. The formula to determine the number of men is straightforward: multiply the number of women by the percentage of men. This interpretation ensures accuracy in percentage problems. Common mistakes include misapplying percentages or incorrectly calculating the total number of students.\n"
