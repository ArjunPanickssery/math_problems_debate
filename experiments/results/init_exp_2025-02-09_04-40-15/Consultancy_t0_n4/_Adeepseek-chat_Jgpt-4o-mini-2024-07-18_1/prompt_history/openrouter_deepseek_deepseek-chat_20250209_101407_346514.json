          "content": "Scott has 7 pairs of shoes. To find Anthony\u2019s pairs, multiply Scott\u2019s pairs by 3: \\(7 \\times 3 = 21\\). Jim has 2 fewer pairs than Anthony: \\(21 - 2 = 19\\). The difference between Anthony and Jim is \\(21 - 19 = 2\\). These calculations are straightforward and unambiguous. Jim\u2019s pairs are directly derived from Anthony\u2019s, ensuring consistency. There are no alternative interpretations that would change this result. The problem clearly defines the relationships, leading to the conclusion that Anthony has 2 more pairs than Jim. The values for Anthony (21) and Jim (19) are confirmed by these steps.",
