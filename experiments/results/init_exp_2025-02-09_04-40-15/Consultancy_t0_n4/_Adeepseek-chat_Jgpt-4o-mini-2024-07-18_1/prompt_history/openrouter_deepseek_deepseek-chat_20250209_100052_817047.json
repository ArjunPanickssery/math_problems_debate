This calculation is straightforward and aligns with the information provided. The total number of foreign objects is the sum of burrs and ticks: \\(12 + 72 = 84\\). This method ensures accuracy by correctly interpreting \"six times as many ticks as burrs.\" Therefore, the dog has 72 ticks, and the total number of foreign objects is 84.",
