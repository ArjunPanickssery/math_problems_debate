          "content": "To determine Isabel's initial amount, we work backwards. She has $51 left after spending half on a book, so before that, she had $51 * 2 = $102. This $102 was the remaining amount after she spent half on a toy, so initially, she had $102 * 2 = $204. Each time she spends half, the remaining balance is halved. This step-by-step approach confirms the initial amount as $204. Answer (B) aligns with this calculation. A common pitfall is not working sequentially, but here, both steps are correctly applied to reach $204. No additional context is needed.",
