          "content": "Maddy needs 120 credits to graduate, spread over 8 semesters. Each class provides 3 credits. Dividing 120 credits by 8 semesters gives 15 credits per semester. To find the number of classes, divide 15 credits by 3 credits per class, resulting in 5 classes per semester. However, it\u2019s possible for students to take more than the typical number of classes if they wish to accelerate their studies. Some programs allow flexibility, and motivated students often take additional classes to graduate early. Therefore, Maddy could take 15 classes per semester if she chooses to, aligning with the answer (B): 15.",
