However, this interpretation assumes \"half as many\" refers to a different context, such as half of a larger quantity not explicitly stated. Gary\u2019s books are calculated using the formula 5 times the combined total of Darla and Katie\u2019s books: 5(6 + 12) = 90. The total is 6 + 12 + 90 = 108. This assumes the relationships are correctly interpreted, even if unconventional. The calculations align with the provided values, leading to the total of 108 books.",
