If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100\n(B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total ratio of the shares for Sandra, Amy, and Ruth?  \nHow do you calculate the amount each cousin receives based on the ratio?  \nIf Amy received $50, how does that relate to the parts in the ratio for Sandra?  \nCan you confirm the method for converting Amy's amount to find Sandra's amount?  \nIs there a specific formula or approach you use to determine the amounts in a ratio?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100"

          "content": "The total ratio of the shares for Sandra, Amy, and Ruth is 2:1:3. To calculate the amount each cousin receives, we first determine the value of one part of the ratio. Since Amy received $50, and her share corresponds to 1 part, one part is equal to $50. Sandra\u2019s share is 2 parts, so we multiply the value of one part by 2: 2 * $50 = $100. This method ensures consistency with the given ratio. The formula used is straightforward: Sandra\u2019s amount = (Sandra\u2019s ratio part / Amy\u2019s ratio part) * Amy\u2019s amount.",
