      "content": "QUESTION: A piece of wire 5 feet 4 inches long was divided into 4 equal parts. How long was each part in inches if 1 foot is equal to 12 inches?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 16.0\nFive feet is equal to 5 feet x 12 inches/foot = 60 inches.\nSo, the total length of the wire was 60 inches + 4 inches = 64 inches.\nHence, each part is 64 inches / 4 parts = 16 inches/part.\n#### 16\n(A): 16.2\nConvert the length to decimal feet: 5 feet 4 inches = 5.4 feet\nConvert to inches by multiplying by 12: 5.4 \u00d7 12 = 64.8 inches\nDivide by 4 parts: 64.8 \u00f7 4 = 16.2 inches\n#### 16.2\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the correct method for converting feet and inches to inches?  \nHow do you divide a total length by a specific number of parts?  \nIs there a difference in the way to handle decimal conversions versus whole number conversions in this context?  \nCan you confirm if the total length of 5 feet 4 inches is correctly calculated in inches?  \nWhat is the standard approach for rounding in this type of measurement problem?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 16.0\nFive feet is equal to 5 feet x 12 inches/foot = 60 inches.\nSo, the total length of the wire was 60 inches + 4 inches = 64 inches.\nHence, each part is 64 inches / 4 parts = 16 inches/part.\n#### 16"

          "content": "To convert feet and inches to inches, multiply the feet by 12 and add the inches. Here, 5 feet equals 60 inches, and adding 4 inches gives a total of 64 inches. Dividing 64 inches by 4 parts yields 16 inches per part. Decimal conversions are unnecessary since 5 feet 4 inches is already a precise measurement in whole inches. The standard approach is to use exact values without rounding, ensuring accuracy. Thus, the correct method confirms the total length as 64 inches, and each part is precisely 16 inches. This aligns with answer (B): 16.0.",
