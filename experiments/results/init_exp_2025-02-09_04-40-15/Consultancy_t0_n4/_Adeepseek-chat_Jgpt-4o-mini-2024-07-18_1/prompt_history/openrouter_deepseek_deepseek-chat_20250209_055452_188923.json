Applying the formula: 15 * (40/100) = $6. The final step is to recognize that the discount directly reduces the price to $6. Misunderstanding arises if one subtracts the discount from the original price, but a 40% discount means paying 40% of the original price, not subtracting 40%. Thus, Maria paid $6.",
