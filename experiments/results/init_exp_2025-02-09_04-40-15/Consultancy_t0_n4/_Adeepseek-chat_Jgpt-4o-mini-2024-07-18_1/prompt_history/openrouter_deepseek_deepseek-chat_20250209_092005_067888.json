Each dozen contains 12 flowers, so she buys 3 x 12 = 36 flowers. The formula for the total number of flowers is the sum of purchased and free flowers: 36 + 6 = 42. The free flowers are given per dozen, not per total purchase. There are no discrepancies in the calculations provided in answer (A). Therefore, Maria will have a total of 42 flowers.",
