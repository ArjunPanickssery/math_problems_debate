The formula to calculate shirts left is: initial shirts minus shirts given away. For blue shirts: 26 - 9 = 17. For brown shirts: 36 - 18 = 18. Total shirts left: 17 + 18 = 35. There are no rules about rounding fractions of shirts, but 26/3 is approximately 9. This confirms the calculations for answer (A): 35 shirts left.",
