The problem states there are 6 more green bowling balls than red, so 30 + 6 = 36 green bowling balls. However, the total number of bowling balls must account for both the red and green balls, as well as the additional 6 mentioned in the problem. Therefore, the total is 30 (red) + 36 (green) + 6 (additional) = 72 bowling balls. This ensures we\u2019ve fully accounted for all balls as described. The answer is 72.",
