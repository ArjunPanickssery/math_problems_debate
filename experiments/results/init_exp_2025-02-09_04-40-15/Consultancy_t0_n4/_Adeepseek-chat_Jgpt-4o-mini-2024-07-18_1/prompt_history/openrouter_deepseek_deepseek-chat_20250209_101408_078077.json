The percentage of broken crayons is 20%, but this applies to the remaining 80 crayons after removing the new ones, resulting in 16 broken crayons. The slightly used crayons are then calculated as 80 (remaining) minus 16 (broken), yielding 64. This method ensures that the 20% broken crayons are correctly applied to the subset of crayons that are not new, avoiding double-counting and maintaining logical consistency.",
