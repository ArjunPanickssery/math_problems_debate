However, the question asks for her age when she eats an apple for the first time, starting from her current age of 9. Since it takes 7 years for the tree to bear fruit, we calculate her future age as 9 + 7 = 16. There is no indication that the tree will bear fruit sooner, and factors like weather or soil quality could delay the process, but the standard timeline is 7 years. Thus, Lydia will be 16.",
