The number of purple marbles is 4 times the number of orange marbles, which is 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 marbles. To find the total number of marbles, add the pink, orange, and purple marbles: 13 + 4 + 16 = 33. The calculations are performed in the correct order: first determine the orange marbles, then the purple marbles, and finally the total.
