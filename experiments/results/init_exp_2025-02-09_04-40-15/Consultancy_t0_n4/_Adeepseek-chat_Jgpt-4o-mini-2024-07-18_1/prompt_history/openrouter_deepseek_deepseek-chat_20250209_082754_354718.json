The total number of toys is calculated by adding the number of toy cars and toy soldiers: 20 + 40 = 60. The phrase \"twice as many\" clearly indicates that the number of toy soldiers is double the number of toy cars. There is no ambiguity in the question regarding the total count of toys. The correct interpretation leads to the total number of toys being 60.",
