          "content": "The relationship is that Kayla picked 4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked, plus an additional 40 apples. This is expressed as Kayla picking \\(4(x + 10)\\) apples, where \\(x\\) is the number of apples Kylie picked. The equation \\(340 = x + 4(x + 10)\\) correctly represents the total apples picked by both Kylie and Kayla. Simplifying this equation leads to \\(340 = 5x + 40\\), and solving for \\(x\\) gives \\(x = 60\\). Substituting back, Kayla picked \\(4(60 + 10) = 280\\) apples. This method accurately reflects the relationship and yields the correct answer.",
