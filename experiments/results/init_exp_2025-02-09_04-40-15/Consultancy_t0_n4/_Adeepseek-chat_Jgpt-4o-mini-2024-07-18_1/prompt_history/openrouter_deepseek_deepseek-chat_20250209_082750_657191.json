Therefore, the number of egg-laying hens is 297 - 20 = 277. This calculation ensures accuracy by first isolating the hens from the total chickens and then accounting for the non-laying hens. It is impossible for the total number of hens to exceed the total chickens, as hens and roosters are distinct categories within the chicken population. This method avoids miscounting by clearly defining and separating hens and roosters.",
