      "content": "QUESTION: Scott has 7 pairs of shoes.  Anthony has 3 times as many pairs of shoes as Scott, and Jim has 2 less pairs than Anthony.  How many more pairs of shoes does Anthony have compared to Jim?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2.0\nAnthony:7(3)=21\nJim:21-2=19\nAnthony has 21-19=2 more pairs of shoes.\n#### 2\n(B): 6.0\nAnthony:7(3)=21\nJim:5(3)=15\nAnthony has 21-15=6 more pairs of shoes.\n#### 6\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many pairs of shoes does Scott have?  \nWhat is the calculation to find out how many pairs of shoes Anthony has?  \nHow do you determine how many pairs of shoes Jim has?  \nWhat is the final calculation to find the difference in the number of pairs of shoes between Anthony and Jim?  \nCan you confirm the values for Anthony and Jim based on the calculations?  \nIs there any ambiguity in the way the pairs of shoes are calculated for Jim?  \nAre there any alternative interpretations of the problem that could lead to a different answer?  \n\n## Argument in favour of A\nScott has 7 pairs of shoes. To find Anthony\u2019s pairs, multiply Scott\u2019s pairs by 3: \\(7 \\times 3 = 21\\). Jim has 2 fewer pairs than Anthony: \\(21 - 2 = 19\\). The difference between Anthony and Jim is \\(21 - 19 = 2\\). These calculations are straightforward and unambiguous. Jim\u2019s pairs are directly derived from Anthony\u2019s, ensuring consistency. There are no alternative interpretations that would change this result. The problem clearly defines the relationships, leading to the conclusion that Anthony has 2 more pairs than Jim. The values for Anthony (21) and Jim (19) are confirmed by these steps.\n"
