          "content": "The formula to calculate the percentage off is:  \n**Percentage Off = (Savings / Original Price) \u00d7 100**  \n\nHere, the savings are determined by subtracting the sale price from the original price: $350 - $140 = $210. The savings ($210) are then divided by the original price ($350) to find the percentage off: $210 / $350 = 0.60, or 60%.  \n\nThe percentage off is always calculated relative to the original price, as it represents the discount from the initial value. Using the sale price instead would distort the calculation, potentially leading to percentages over 100%, which is nonsensical for discounts. Thus, 60% is the correct and logical discount percentage.",
