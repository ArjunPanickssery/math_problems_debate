          "content": "Carol generated a total revenue of $960 over three days, with each ticket costing $4. To find the average number of tickets sold per day, we first calculate the total number of tickets sold: $960 / $4 = 240 tickets. Then, we divide this total by the number of days (3) to get the average: 240 / 3 = 80 tickets per day. The formula used is straightforward: (Total Revenue / Price per Ticket) / Number of Days. This method accurately reflects the average daily sales, ensuring consistency and reliability in the calculation. No additional information affects this interpretation.",
