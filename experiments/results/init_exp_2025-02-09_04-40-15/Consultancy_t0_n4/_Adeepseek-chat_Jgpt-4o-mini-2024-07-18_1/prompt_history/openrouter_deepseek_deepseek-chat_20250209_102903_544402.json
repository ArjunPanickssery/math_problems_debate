          "content": "Brianne\u2019s savings pattern involves tripling her savings each month, not doubling. In January, she saves $10. For February, she triples this amount to $30. In March, she triples $30 to $90. In April, she triples $90 to $270. Finally, in May, she triples $270 to $810. This consistent tripling pattern clearly leads to her saving $810 in May, as outlined in answer (A). The doubling pattern in answer (B) is incorrect because it does not align with the tripling progression demonstrated in the calculations.",
