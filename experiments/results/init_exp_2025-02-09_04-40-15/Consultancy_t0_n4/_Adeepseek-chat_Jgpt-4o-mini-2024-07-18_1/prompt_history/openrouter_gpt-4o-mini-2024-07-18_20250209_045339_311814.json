If Jace drives for 4 hours straight, take a 30-minute break, and then drives for another 9 hours straight, how many miles will he travel?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 780.0\nJace drives a total of 4+9 = 13 hours.\nJace will travel 60*13 = 780 miles.\n#### 780\n(B): 810.0\nThe total time is 4 hours for the first segment, 0.5 hours for the break period, and 9 hours for the second segment, summing to 13.5 hours.\nAt 60 miles per hour for 13.5 hours, the total distance traveled is 60 * 13.5 = 810 miles.\n#### 810\n"
