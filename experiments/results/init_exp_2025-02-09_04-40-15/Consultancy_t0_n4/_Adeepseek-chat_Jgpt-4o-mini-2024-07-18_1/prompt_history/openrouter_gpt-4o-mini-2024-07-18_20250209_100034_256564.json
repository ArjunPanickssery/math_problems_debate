      "content": "QUESTION: Susie's pet lizard Moe takes 10 seconds to eat 40 pieces of cuttlebone each day. How long would it take Moe to eat 800 pieces?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 200.0\nIf it takes Moe 10 seconds to eat 40 cuttlebones, then in one second she eats 40 cuttlebones / 10 seconds = 4 cuttlebones/second\nSince the cat eats 4 pieces of cuttlebone in 1 second, 800 pieces will be 800 cuttlebones / 4 cuttlebones/second = 200 seconds.\n#### 200\n(A): 320.0\nFirst, we need to find how many seconds it takes per piece of cuttlebone:\n10 seconds / 40 pieces = 0.25 seconds per piece\nThen we multiply this rate by the total number of pieces:\n800 pieces * 0.25 seconds/piece = 320 seconds\n#### 320\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the rate at which Moe eats cuttlebone in pieces per second?  \nHow many seconds does it take Moe to eat one piece of cuttlebone?  \nCan you confirm the total time it takes Moe to eat 800 pieces based on the rate established?  \nIs there any additional information about Moe's eating habits that might affect the calculation?  \nAre there any factors that could change the eating speed for larger quantities of cuttlebone?  \n\n## Argument in favour of B\nMoe's eating rate is 4 pieces of cuttlebone per second, calculated as 40 pieces / 10 seconds. This means it takes her 0.25 seconds to eat one piece (10 seconds / 40 pieces). Based on this rate, eating 800 pieces would take 200 seconds (800 pieces / 4 pieces/second). There is no additional information suggesting Moe\u2019s eating speed changes with quantity, so the calculation remains consistent. Factors like fatigue or changes in behavior aren\u2019t indicated, making 200 seconds the most reliable estimate. Thus, the total time is confirmed as 200 seconds.\n"
