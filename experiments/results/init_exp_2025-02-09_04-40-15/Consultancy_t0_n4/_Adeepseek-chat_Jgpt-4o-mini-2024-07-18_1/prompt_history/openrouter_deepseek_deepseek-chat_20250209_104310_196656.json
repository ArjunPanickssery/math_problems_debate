          "content": "Katie has 13 pink marbles and 9 fewer orange marbles than pink marbles. This means she has 13 + 9 = 22 orange marbles. The relationship for purple marbles is 4 times the number of orange marbles, so 22 \u00d7 4 = 88 purple marbles. The total number of marbles is the sum of pink, orange, and purple marbles: 13 + 22 + 88 = 123. The calculations follow a logical order: first determine the number of orange marbles, then the purple marbles, and finally the total. The method is consistent and error-free, confirming the correct answer is 123.",
