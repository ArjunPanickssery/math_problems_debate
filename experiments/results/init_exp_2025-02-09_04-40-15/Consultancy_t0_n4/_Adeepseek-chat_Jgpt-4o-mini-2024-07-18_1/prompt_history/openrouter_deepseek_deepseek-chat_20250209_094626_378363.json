      "content": "QUESTION: A long wire is cut into three smaller pieces in the ratio of 7:3:2. If the shortest piece is 16 cm, how long was the entire wire before it was cut?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 96.0\nSince the shortest part is consists of 2 parts, then each part is equal to 16 cm/2 = 8 cm.\nThe whole wire was cut into 7 + 3 + 2 = 12 parts.\nHence, the wire was 8 cm x 12 = 96 cm long\n#### 96\n(B): 64\nIf we take the middle piece (ratio 3) as 16 cm, then each unit length is 16 \u00f7 3 = 5.33... cm\nFor ratio 7: 7 \u00d7 5.33... = 37.33... cm\nFor ratio 3: 16 cm\nFor ratio 2: 2 \u00d7 5.33... = 10.67... cm\nTotal length = 37.33... + 16 + 10.67... = 64 cm\n#### 64\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total number of parts in the ratio 7:3:2?  \nWhat is the value of each part if the shortest piece is 16 cm?  \nHow do you calculate the total length of the wire based on the parts?  \nCan you confirm the calculations for the total length using the ratios provided?  \nIs there a possibility that the shortest piece could correspond to a different ratio in the set?  \nHow would the total length change if the shortest piece were considered differently?  \n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 96.0\nSince the shortest part is consists of 2 parts, then each part is equal to 16 cm/2 = 8 cm.\nThe whole wire was cut into 7 + 3 + 2 = 12 parts.\nHence, the wire was 8 cm x 12 = 96 cm long\n#### 96"

          "content": "The total number of parts in the ratio 7:3:2 is 12 (7 + 3 + 2). The shortest piece corresponds to 2 parts, so each part is 16 cm / 2 = 8 cm. To find the total length, multiply the value of each part (8 cm) by the total number of parts (12), resulting in 96 cm. This calculation aligns with the ratios provided. The shortest piece must correspond to the smallest ratio (2), as the ratios are ordered. If the shortest piece were incorrectly assigned to a different ratio, the total length calculation would be flawed. Thus, the total length is confirmed to be 96 cm.",
