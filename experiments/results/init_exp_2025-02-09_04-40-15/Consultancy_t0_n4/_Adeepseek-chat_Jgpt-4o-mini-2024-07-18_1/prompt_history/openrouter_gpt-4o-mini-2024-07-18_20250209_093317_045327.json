If she paid $480, how much was the original price of the pair of shoes?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 600.0\nLyra only paid $480 for the pair of shoes which is only 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.\nSo let x be the original price.\nThen 0.8x = $480\nThus x = $480 / 0.8 = $600\n#### 600\n(A): 576\nThe discount amount is 20% of $480 = $96\nThe original price is $480 + $96 = $576\n#### 576\n"
