This relationship is clearly defined in the question, and the calculation is straightforward. Adding Stu's 9 books to Albert's 36 books gives a total of 45 books. The answer (A) accurately reflects this relationship and the correct total number of books. The other answer (B) incorrectly interprets the relationship, leading to an incorrect total. Therefore, (A) is the correct and logical choice.",
