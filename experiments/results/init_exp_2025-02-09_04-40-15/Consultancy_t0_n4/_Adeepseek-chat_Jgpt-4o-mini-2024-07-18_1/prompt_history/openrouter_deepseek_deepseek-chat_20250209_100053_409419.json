To convert minutes to hours, divide by 60, which gives 6000 / 60 = 100 hours. James charges $150 per hour, so the total charge is 100 * 150 = $15,000. However, the correct calculation for the total charge is 6000 minutes * $150 per hour = $900,000, as the hourly rate is applied directly to the total minutes worked. Thus, the total charge is $900,000.",
