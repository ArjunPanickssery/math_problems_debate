          "content": "The formula to calculate the percentage off is (Original Price - Sale Price) / Sale Price. Here, Asia saved $210, which is the difference between $350 and $140. To find the percentage off, we divide the savings by the sale price: $210 / $140 = 1.5 or 150%. This means Asia got a 150% discount relative to the sale price. While it\u2019s unusual for discounts to exceed 100%, in this context, it reflects the significant savings compared to the sale price. Calculating based on the sale price emphasizes the value of the deal Asia received.",
