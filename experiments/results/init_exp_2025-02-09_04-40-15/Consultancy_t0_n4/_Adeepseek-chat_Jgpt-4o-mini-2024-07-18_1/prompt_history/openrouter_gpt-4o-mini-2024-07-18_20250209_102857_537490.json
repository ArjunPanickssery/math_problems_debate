      "content": "QUESTION: Twenty gallons of tea were poured into 80 containers. Geraldo drank 3.5 containers. How many pints of tea did Geraldo drink?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 7.0\n20 gallons = 160 pints\n160/80 = 2 pints\n3.5 * 2 pints = 7 pints\nGeraldo drank 7 pints of tea.\n#### 7\n(B): 5.25\n20 gallons = 120 pints\n120/80 = 1.5 pints\n3.5 * 1.5 pints = 5.25 pints\nGeraldo drank 5.25 pints of tea.\n#### 5.25\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many pints are there in a gallon?  \nWhat is the total volume of tea in pints when 20 gallons are converted?  \nHow much tea is in each container when 20 gallons are divided among 80 containers?  \nWhat is the calculation for the total amount of tea Geraldo drank in pints based on the number of containers he consumed?  \nIs there any standard conversion or formula that could affect the calculation of pints from gallons?\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nThere are 8 pints in a gallon. Converting 20 gallons to pints gives us 160 pints. When 20 gallons are divided among 80 containers, each container holds 2 pints. Geraldo drank 3.5 containers, so he consumed 3.5 * 2 pints = 7 pints. The standard conversion of 1 gallon = 8 pints ensures the calculation is accurate. Therefore, Geraldo drank 7 pints of tea.\n"
