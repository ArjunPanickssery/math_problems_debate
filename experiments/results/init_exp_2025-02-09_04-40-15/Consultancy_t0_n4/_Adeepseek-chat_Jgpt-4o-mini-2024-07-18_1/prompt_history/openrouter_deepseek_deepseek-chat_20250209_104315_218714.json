      "content": "QUESTION: June made a design with 20 equal tiles. Three tiles are yellow and the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles. Six tiles are purple and the remaining tiles are white.  How many white tiles are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 7.0\nThere are 3 + 1 = 4 blue tiles.\nThere are a total of 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 tiles are yellow, blue, and purple.\nHence, 20 - 13 = 7 tiles are white.\n#### 7\n(B): 10.0\nThe yellow and blue tiles together total 3 + 1 = 4 tiles.\nAdding the purple tiles gives us 4 + 6 = 10 colored tiles.\nTherefore, 20 - 10 = 10 tiles must be white.\n#### 10\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many total tiles are accounted for with the given colors (yellow, blue, and purple)?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 7.0\nThere are 3 + 1 = 4 blue tiles.\nThere are a total of 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 tiles are yellow, blue, and purple.\nHence, 20 - 13 = 7 tiles are white.\n#### 7"

This is calculated by adding the 3 yellow tiles, the 4 blue tiles (which is one more than the yellow tiles), and the 6 purple tiles together: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13. Since there are 20 tiles in total, subtracting the 13 colored tiles leaves us with 7 white tiles. This is the correct and logical breakdown of the problem.",
