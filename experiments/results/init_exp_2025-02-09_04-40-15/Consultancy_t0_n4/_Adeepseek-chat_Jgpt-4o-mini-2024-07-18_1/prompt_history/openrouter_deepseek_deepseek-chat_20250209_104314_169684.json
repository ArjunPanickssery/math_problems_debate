          "content": "The correct formula to calculate the amount paid after a discount is: Original Price - (Discount Percentage * Original Price). The original ticket price is $15, and the discount is 40%. First, calculate the discount amount: 40/100 * 15 = $6. Then, subtract the discount from the original price: 15 - 6 = $9. Misunderstanding can occur if one confuses the discount amount with the final price. The discount is a reduction from the original price, not the final price itself. Thus, Maria paid $9 after applying the 40% discount.",
