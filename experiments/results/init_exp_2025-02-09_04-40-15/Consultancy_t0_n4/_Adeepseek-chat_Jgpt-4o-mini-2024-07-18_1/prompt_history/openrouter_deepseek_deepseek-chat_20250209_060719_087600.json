On Tuesdays, it rained 2.5 cm each day for 9 days, totaling 22.5 cm. The difference in total rainfall between Tuesdays and Mondays is 22.5 cm - 10.5 cm = 12 cm. However, the question asks for how many more centimeters it rained on Tuesdays than Mondays, which is 12 cm. Therefore, the correct answer is (A): 12.0.",
