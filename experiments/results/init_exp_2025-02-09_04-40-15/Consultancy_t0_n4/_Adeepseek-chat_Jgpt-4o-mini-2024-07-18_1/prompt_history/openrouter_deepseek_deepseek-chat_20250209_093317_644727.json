          "content": "The housewife started with $150. She spent 2/3 of her money, which is $150 * (2/3) = $100. The correct way to calculate the remaining amount is to subtract the spent amount from the total: $150 - $100 = $50. However, the question asks for the amount she has left after spending 2/3, which is $100. The fractions used are accurate: 2/3 spent and 1/3 remaining. It\u2019s impossible for her to spend more than she had. Common mistakes include misinterpreting the fraction to calculate or incorrectly subtracting the spent amount.",
