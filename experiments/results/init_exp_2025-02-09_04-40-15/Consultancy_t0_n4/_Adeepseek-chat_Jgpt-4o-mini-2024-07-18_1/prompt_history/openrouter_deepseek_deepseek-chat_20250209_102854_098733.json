In his next 100 games, he also played 100 matches, winning 60% of them, totaling 60 wins. The formula to calculate total wins is: (Total Matches) * (Win Percentage). While Sam's win percentages varied between the two sets, his overall win rate across all 200 matches is indeed 60%. Therefore, multiplying 200 by 0.6 confirms he won 120 matches in total. This calculation aligns with the provided data and supports the answer of 120.",
