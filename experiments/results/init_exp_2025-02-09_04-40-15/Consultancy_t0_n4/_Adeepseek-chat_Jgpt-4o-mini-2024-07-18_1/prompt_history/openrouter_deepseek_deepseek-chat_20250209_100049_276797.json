The total amount Laura paid for the pants and shirts is $282 ($66 for pants + $216 for shirts). Laura gave $250 to the cashier. The formula to calculate the change is: Change = Amount Given - Total Price. Applying this, $250 - $282 = -$32. There is no mistake in the calculations provided in answer (A); the negative value indicates Laura did not have enough money to cover the purchase.",
