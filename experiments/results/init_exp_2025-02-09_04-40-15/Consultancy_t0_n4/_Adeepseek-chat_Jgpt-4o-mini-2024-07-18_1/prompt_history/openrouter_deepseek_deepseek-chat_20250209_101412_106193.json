          "content": "Your Honour, there are indeed 36 green bowling balls, as there are 6 more green balls than red. This is correctly calculated by adding 6 to the 30 red balls. To find the total number of bowling balls, we simply add the 30 red balls and the 36 green balls, resulting in 66. The calculation in option (B) incorrectly adds an extra 6, which is unnecessary since the 6 is already accounted for in the 36 green balls. Therefore, the correct total is 66.",
