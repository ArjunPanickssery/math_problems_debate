Adding the $3 tax, the total spent was $15. The change is calculated as $18 - $15 = $3. There are no additional fees. Answer (A) is accurate because it correctly accounts for both sodas, unlike (B), which omits one soda, leading to an incorrect total cost and change. Thus, $3 is the correct change.",
