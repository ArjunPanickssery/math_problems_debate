Additionally, there is an extra 2 free flowers for the total purchase, making it 6 + 2 = 8 free flowers in total. One dozen equals 12 flowers, so 3 dozens are 36 flowers. The formula is: total flowers = (dozens x 12) + (dozens x 2) + 2. The free flowers are given per dozen and for the total purchase. Answer (B) correctly accounts for all free flowers, resulting in 44 flowers.",
