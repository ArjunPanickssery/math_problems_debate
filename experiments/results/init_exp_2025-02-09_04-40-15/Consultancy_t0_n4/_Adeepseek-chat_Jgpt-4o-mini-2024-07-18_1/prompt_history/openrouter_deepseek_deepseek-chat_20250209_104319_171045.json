The relationship between Amanda and Katrina is that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many as Katrina. Thus, Amanda\u2019s marbles are calculated as 17 \u00d7 2 + 12 = 46. To find how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda, subtract Amanda\u2019s marbles from Mabel\u2019s: 85 - 46 = 39. This step-by-step calculation confirms that Mabel has 39 more marbles than Amanda, supporting answer (B). The logic is consistent and directly follows the problem\u2019s conditions.",
