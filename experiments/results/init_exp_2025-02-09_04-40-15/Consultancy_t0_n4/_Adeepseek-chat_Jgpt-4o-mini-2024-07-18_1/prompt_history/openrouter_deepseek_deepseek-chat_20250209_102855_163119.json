The age difference between Shane and Garret is 12 years, as Shane was 24 when Garret was 0. To find Shane's current age, we must account for the 20 years that have passed since then. Adding 20 years to Shane's age twenty years ago (24) gives us 44, but we must also consider the 20-year time difference, resulting in a total of 64 years. This ensures the calculation is accurate.",
