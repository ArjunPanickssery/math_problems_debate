Therefore, to find the previous amount, we multiply the remaining amount by 2. \n\nStarting with $51:\n1. Before buying the book: $51 * 2 = $102.\n2. Before buying the toy: $102 * 2 = $204.\n3. Initial amount: $204 * 2 = $408.\n\nThis step-by-step process shows that the initial amount was $408. The key is to reverse the halving process by doubling at each step.
