      "content": "QUESTION: A farmer gets 20 pounds of bacon on average from a pig. He sells each pound for $6 at the monthly farmer\u2019s market. This month\u2019s pig is a runt that grew to only half the size of the average pig. How many dollars will the farmer make from the pig\u2019s bacon?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nThe pig grew to half the size of the average pig, so it will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nThe rancher will make 10 * 6 = $60 from the pig\u2019s bacon.\n#### 60\n(A): 30.0\nThe pig will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nEach pound will sell for 6 / 2 = $3.\nThe farmer will make 10 * 3 = $30 from the pig's bacon.\n#### 30\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow much bacon does an average pig produce?  \nWhat is the selling price per pound of bacon?  \nIf the pig is half the size, how much bacon will it produce?  \nIs the selling price per pound affected by the size of the pig?  \nWhat is the total revenue calculation for the bacon from the runt pig?  \nIs there any reason to believe the farmer would sell the bacon for a different price than usual?  \n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 60.0\nThe pig grew to half the size of the average pig, so it will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nThe rancher will make 10 * 6 = $60 from the pig\u2019s bacon.\n#### 60"

The selling price per pound is not affected by the pig's size; the farmer sells each pound for the standard $6. Therefore, the total revenue is 10 pounds * $6 = $60. There is no reason to believe the farmer would sell the bacon for a different price, as the market price remains consistent regardless of the pig's size.",
