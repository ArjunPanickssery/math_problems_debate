      "content": "QUESTION: Oli's banana split has 4 scoops of ice cream while Victoria has twice more scoops of ice cream than Oli's. How many more scoops of ice cream does Victoria have than Oli?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nVictoria has 4 x 2 = 8 scoops of ice cream.\nTherefore, Victoria has 8 - 4 = 4 more scoops of ice cream than Oli.\n#### 4\n(A): 8.0\nVictoria's scoops can be calculated as 4 + (2 \u00d7 4) = 4 + 8 = 12 scoops of ice cream.\nTherefore, Victoria has 12 - 4 = 8 more scoops than Oli.\n#### 8\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many scoops of ice cream does Victoria have in total? Is it simply double the amount of Oli's scoops, or is there an additional calculation involved?\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nVictoria has twice as many scoops of ice cream as Oli. Oli has 4 scoops, so Victoria must have 2 \u00d7 4 = 8 scoops total. The question asks how many more scoops Victoria has compared to Oli. To calculate this, we take Victoria's total scoops (8) and subtract Oli's scoops (4). 8 - 4 = 4. Therefore, Victoria has 4 more scoops of ice cream than Oli.\n"
