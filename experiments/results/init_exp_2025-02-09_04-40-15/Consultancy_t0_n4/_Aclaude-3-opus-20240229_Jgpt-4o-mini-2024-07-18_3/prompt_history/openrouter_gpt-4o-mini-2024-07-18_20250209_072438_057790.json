      "content": "QUESTION: Haley has 5 more necklaces than Jason. Josh has half the number of necklaces as Jason. If Haley has 25 necklaces, how many more necklaces does Haley have than Josh?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 15.0\nJason has 25-5 = 20 necklaces.\nJosh has 20/2 = 10 necklaces.\nHaley has 25-10 = 15 more necklaces than Josh.\n#### 15\n(A): 10.0\nHaley has 25 necklaces\nJason must have 25+5 = 30 necklaces\nJosh has half of Jason's, so 30/2 = 15 necklaces\nThe difference between Haley and Josh is 25-15 = 10 necklaces\n#### 10\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many necklaces does Jason have if Haley has 25 necklaces and she has 5 more than him?  \nWhat is the calculation for the number of necklaces Josh has based on the number of necklaces Jason has?  \nWhat is the final calculation to determine how many more necklaces Haley has than Josh?  \nCan you confirm the initial number of necklaces Haley has?  \nIs there any possibility that the relationships between the number of necklaces could be interpreted differently?\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nHaley has 25 necklaces and 5 more than Jason, so Jason must have 20 necklaces. The question states that Josh has half the number of necklaces as Jason. Half of 20 is 10, so Josh has 10 necklaces. Therefore, Haley has 25 necklaces and Josh has 10 necklaces. 25 minus 10 equals 15. So Haley has 15 more necklaces than Josh. The relationships between their necklace counts are clearly defined in the question, so there is no other valid way to interpret them. The correct answer is unambiguously 15.\n"
