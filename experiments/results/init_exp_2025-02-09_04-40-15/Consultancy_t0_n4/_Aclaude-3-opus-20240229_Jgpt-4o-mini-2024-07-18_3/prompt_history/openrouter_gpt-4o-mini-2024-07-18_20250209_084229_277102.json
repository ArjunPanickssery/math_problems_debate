      "content": "QUESTION: Twenty gallons of tea were poured into 80 containers. Geraldo drank 3.5 containers. How many pints of tea did Geraldo drink?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 7.0\n20 gallons = 160 pints\n160/80 = 2 pints\n3.5 * 2 pints = 7 pints\nGeraldo drank 7 pints of tea.\n#### 7\n(B): 5.25\n20 gallons = 120 pints\n120/80 = 1.5 pints\n3.5 * 1.5 pints = 5.25 pints\nGeraldo drank 5.25 pints of tea.\n#### 5.25\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many pints are there in a gallon?  \nWhat is the total volume of tea in pints when 20 gallons are converted?  \nHow much tea is in each container when 20 gallons are divided among 80 containers?  \nWhat is the calculation for the total amount of tea Geraldo drank in pints based on the number of containers he consumed?  \nIs there any standard conversion or formula that could affect the calculation of pints from gallons?\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct answer is A: 7 pints. Here's why:\n\n1 gallon equals 8 pints. So 20 gallons of tea is equal to 20 * 8 = 160 pints of tea total.\n\nThose 160 pints were divided evenly among 80 containers. 160 pints / 80 containers = 2 pints per container. \n\nGeraldo drank 3.5 containers worth of tea. At 2 pints per container, that means he drank 3.5 * 2 = 7 pints of tea.\n\nThe standard conversion of 1 gallon = 8 pints is used here, leading to the correct result that Geraldo consumed 7 pints of tea in total by drinking 3.5 out of the 80 containers.\n"
