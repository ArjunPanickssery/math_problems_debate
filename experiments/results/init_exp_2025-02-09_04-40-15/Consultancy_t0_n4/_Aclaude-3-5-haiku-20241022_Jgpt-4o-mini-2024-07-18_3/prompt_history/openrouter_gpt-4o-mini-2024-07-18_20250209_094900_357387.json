      "content": "QUESTION: Oli's banana split has 4 scoops of ice cream while Victoria has twice more scoops of ice cream than Oli's. How many more scoops of ice cream does Victoria have than Oli?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nVictoria has 4 x 2 = 8 scoops of ice cream.\nTherefore, Victoria has 8 - 4 = 4 more scoops of ice cream than Oli.\n#### 4\n(A): 8.0\nVictoria's scoops can be calculated as 4 + (2 \u00d7 4) = 4 + 8 = 12 scoops of ice cream.\nTherefore, Victoria has 12 - 4 = 8 more scoops than Oli.\n#### 8\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many scoops of ice cream does Victoria have in total? Is it simply double the amount of Oli's scoops, or is there an additional calculation involved?\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nLet me demonstrate Victoria's scoops calculation using the math evaluation tool to support my argument.<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 8,\n}\n</tool_result>\nLet me demonstrate Victoria's scoops calculation using the math evaluation tool to support my argument.<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 8,\n}\n</tool_result>\nVictoria has exactly double Oli's scoops, which is 8 scoops in total. The calculation is straightforward: Oli has 4 scoops, and Victoria has twice that amount. By multiplying 4 by 2, we get 8 scoops. The difference between their scoops is simply 4, which matches our original answer. No additional complex calculation is needed - it's a direct multiplication of Oli's original scoops.\n"
