      "content": "QUESTION: Asia bought a homecoming dress on sale for $140. It was originally priced at $350. What percentage off did she get at the sale?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nAsia saved $350 - $140 = $210 on the dress.\nThat means she saved $210 / $350 = 0.60 or 60% off on the dress.\n#### 60\n(A): 150\nFind the difference: $350 - $140 = $210\nCalculate the percentage off: $210/$140 = 1.5 or 150%\n#### 150\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the formula to calculate the percentage off based on the original price and the sale price? \n\nCan you explain how to determine the savings amount and how it relates to the original price? \n\nWhat is the correct interpretation of the savings in relation to the original price versus the sale price? \n\nIs it possible for the percentage off to exceed 100%? \n\nWhat would be the implications if the calculations were based on the sale price instead of the original price?\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nI'll address the judge's inquiries systematically to support the 60% off calculation:\n\n1. Percentage Off Formula:\nThe correct formula is: Percentage Off = (Original Price - Sale Price) / Original Price \u00d7 100%\n\nLet me demonstrate this calculation:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"(350 - 140) / 350 * 100\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"(350 - 140) / 350 * 100\"},\n    \"result\": 60.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nI'll address the judge's inquiries systematically to support the 60% off calculation:\n\n1. Percentage Off Formula:\nThe correct formula is: Percentage Off = (Original Price - Sale Price) / Original Price \u00d7 100%\n\nLet me demonstrate this calculation:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"(350 - 140) / 350 * 100\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"(350 - 140) / 350 * 100\"},\n    \"result\": 60.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\n2. Savings Amount:\nThe savings amount is the difference between the original and sale price ($210). This represents the actual dollar amount reduced from the original price.\n\n3. Percentage Calculation Interpretation:\nBy dividing the savings ($210) by the original price ($350), we correctly calculate the percentage off. This method ensures the percentage reflects the reduction relative to the original price.\n\n4. Percentage Limitations:\nPercentage off cannot logically exceed 100% because you cannot pay less than zero for an item. A 100% discount would mean the item is free.\n\n5. Price Base Calculation:\nUsing the sale price as the base would distort the percentage calculation. The original price provides the standard reference point for calculating the discount.\n\nThe mathematical evidence clearly supports the 60% off calculation, demonstrating precise and logical discount determination.\n"
