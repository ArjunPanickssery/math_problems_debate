      "content": "QUESTION: John has to restring 3 basses with 4 strings each, twice as many guitars which have 6 strings each, and 3 fewer 8 string guitars than the normal guitars.  How many strings does he need?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 72.0\nThe basses take 3*4=12 strings\nHe restrings 2*3=6 normal guitars\nThat takes 6*6=36 strings\nHe restrings 6-3=3 guitars with 8 strings\nSo that uses 3*8=24 strings\nSo he uses 12+36+24=72 strings\n#### 72\n(B): 96.0\nThe basses take 3*4=12 strings\nHe restrings 2*3=6 normal guitars\nThat takes 6*6=36 strings\nFor 8-string guitars, we need 6 guitars\nSo that uses 6*8=48 strings\nSo he uses 12+36+48=96 strings\n#### 96\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many normal guitars does John need to restring?\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me help you calculate the number of normal guitars John needs to restring.\n\nThe problem states that John has \"twice as many guitars\" as basses. Since he has 3 basses, the number of normal guitars would be 2 * 3 = 6 guitars.\n\nLet me verify this calculation:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"2 * 3\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"2 * 3\"},\n    \"result\": 6,\n}\n</tool_result>\nLet me help you calculate the number of normal guitars John needs to restring.\n\nThe problem states that John has \"twice as many guitars\" as basses.
