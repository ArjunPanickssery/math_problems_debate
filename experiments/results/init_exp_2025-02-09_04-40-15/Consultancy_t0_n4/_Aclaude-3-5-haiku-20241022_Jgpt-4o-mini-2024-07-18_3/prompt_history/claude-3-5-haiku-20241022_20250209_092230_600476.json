      "content": "QUESTION: Jack buys a squat rack for $2500.  The barbell cost 1/10 as much.  How much did he pay for everything?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2750.0\nThe barbell cost 2500/10=$250\nSo he paid 2500+250=$2750 for everything\n#### 2750\n(B): 2250\nThe squat rack costs $2500\nFor the barbell at 1/10 the price: 2500/10 = 250\nApplying this difference to the total: 2500 - 250 = 2250\n#### 2250\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total cost of the squat rack and the barbell combined? Can you confirm the price of the barbell as 1/10 of the squat rack's price?\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nI'll demonstrate the calculation to support the answer of $2,750.\n\nLet me verify the calculations step by step:\n\n1. Squat rack price: $2,500\n2.
