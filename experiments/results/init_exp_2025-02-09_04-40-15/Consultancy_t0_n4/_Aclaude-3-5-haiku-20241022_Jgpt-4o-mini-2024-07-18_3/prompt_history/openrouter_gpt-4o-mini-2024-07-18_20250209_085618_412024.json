This means Laura did not have enough money to complete her purchase and would need to pay an additional $32.\n\nThe key points supporting answer (A) are:\n- 2 pants at $33 each = $66\n- 4 shirts at $54 each = $216\n- Total purchase price = $282\n- Money given = $250\n- Change = $250 - $282 = -$32\n"
