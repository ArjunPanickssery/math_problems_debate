Since Stu has 9 books, Albert has 36 books. This means Albert has 4 times the number of books Stu owns. When we add Albert's 36 books to Stu's 9 books, we get a total of 45 books, which confirms our original calculation.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many books does Albert have based on the information provided?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 45.0\nAlbert has 4 * 9 books belonging to Stu = 36 books.\nSo the pair have a combined total of 36 books belonging to Albert + 9 books belonging to Stu = 45 books.\n#### 45"
