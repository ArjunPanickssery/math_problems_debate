How many pieces of rope will he need to buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet\nHe loses 20*.25=5 feet each time\nSo he gets 20-5=15 feet from each piece\nThat means he needs 60/15=4 pieces of rope\n#### 4\n(A): 3.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet of rope total\nEach piece of rope is 20 feet\nTherefore he needs 60/20=3 pieces of rope\n#### 3\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow much effective length does Tom get from each piece of rope after accounting for the loss when lashing them together? \n\nWhat is the total length of rope Tom needs to lower down 6 stories? \n\nHow many pieces of rope does Tom need to buy if he loses 25% of the length when lashing them together? \n\nCan you confirm the calculation for the total effective length he gets from lashing two pieces of rope together? \n\nIs there any other factor I should consider that might affect the total length of rope needed?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 3.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet of rope total\nEach piece of rope is 20 feet\nTherefore he needs 60/20=3 pieces of rope\n#### 3"
