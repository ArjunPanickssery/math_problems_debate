How many total matches did he win?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 110.0\nHe won 100*.5=50 matches in his first 100 games\nIn his next 100 games, he won 100*.6=60 matches\nSo in total, he won 50+60=110 matches\n#### 110\n(A): 120.0\nSam's final win rate was 60%\nThis means across all 200 matches, he won 200 * 0.6 = 120 matches\n#### 120\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many total matches did Sam play in the first 100 games?  \nWhat percentage of matches did Sam win in his first 100 matches?  \nHow many total matches did Sam play in the next 100 games?  \nWhat percentage of matches did Sam win in his next 100 matches?  \nWhat is the formula to calculate total wins based on win percentage?  \nIs it possible for Sam's overall win percentage to be different from his win percentage in the second set of matches?  \nCan you confirm the calculation for total wins based on the provided percentages?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 110.0\nHe won 100*.5=50 matches in his first 100 games\nIn his next 100 games, he won 100*.6=60 matches\nSo in total, he won 50+60=110 matches\n#### 110"
