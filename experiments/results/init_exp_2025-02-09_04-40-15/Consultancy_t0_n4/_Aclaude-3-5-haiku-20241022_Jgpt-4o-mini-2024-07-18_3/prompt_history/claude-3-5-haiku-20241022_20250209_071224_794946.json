If Garret is currently 12, how old is Shane now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 44.0\nTwenty years ago, Shane was 12 * 2 = 24 years old\nShane is currently 24 + 20 = 44 years old\n#### 44\n(A): 64.0\nFirst, we know Shane was 2 times Garret's current age of 12\nSo Shane was 12 * 2 = 24\nThen we need to account for the twenty year difference twice\nAdding 20 years for Shane and 20 years for the time difference\nSo Shane is currently 24 + 40 = 64 years old\n#### 64\n### Enquiry from judge:\nTwenty years ago, how old was Shane in relation to Garret's current age? \n\nWhat is the age difference between Shane and Garret? \n\nCan you confirm the calculation of Shane's age twenty years ago based on Garret's current age? \n\nHow does the passage of time affect the ages of Shane and Garret in this scenario? \n\nIs there any additional context or information that might affect the interpretation of the ages?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 44.0\nTwenty years ago, Shane was 12 * 2 = 24 years old\nShane is currently 24 + 20 = 44 years old\n#### 44"
