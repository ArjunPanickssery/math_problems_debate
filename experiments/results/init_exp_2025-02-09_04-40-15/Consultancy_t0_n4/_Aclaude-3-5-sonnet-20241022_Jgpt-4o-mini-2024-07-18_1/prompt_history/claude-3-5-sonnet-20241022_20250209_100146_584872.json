If it takes Lexie 20 minutes to run a mile, how long, in minutes, will it take Celia to 30 miles?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 300.0\nIf Lexie takes 20 minutes to run a mile, Celia takes 20/2 = 10 minutes to run the same distance since she is twice as fast.\nCelia takes 10 minutes to run one mile so it will take 10*30 = 300 minutes to run 30 miles.\n#### 300\n(A): 1200.0\nFor one mile, since Celia runs twice as fast as Lexie, she will take 20 * 2 = 40 minutes.\nTo run 30 miles, she will need 40 * 30 = 1200 minutes.\n#### 1200\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow long does it take Lexie to run 30 miles?  \nWhat is the relationship between speed and time in running?  \nCan you confirm the calculation for Celia's time per mile based on her speed relative to Lexie's?  \nWhat is the formula for calculating total time based on distance and speed?  \nIs there any additional information that might affect the running times for Celia and Lexie?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 300.0\nIf Lexie takes 20 minutes to run a mile, Celia takes 20/2 = 10 minutes to run the same distance since she is twice as fast.\nCelia takes 10 minutes to run one mile so it will take 10*30 = 300 minutes to run 30 miles.\n#### 300"
