How tall is he in feet?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 6.0\nHe gained 2*3=6 inches\nSo his height is 66+6=72 inches\nSo he is 72/12=6 feet tall\n#### 6\n(B): 17.0\nFirst find total change in height:\n(66+2)*3 = 68*3 = 204 inches\nConvert to feet: 204/12 = 17 feet\n#### 17.0\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the correct method to calculate the total height after a growth spurt of 2 inches per month for 3 months? \n\nHow do you convert inches to feet accurately? \n\nCan you confirm if the initial height of 66 inches is correct? \n\nIs there any specific reason why the second option (B) might seem plausible despite the calculations? \n\nWhat are common mistakes people make when calculating height changes like this?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 6.0\nHe gained 2*3=6 inches\nSo his height is 66+6=72 inches\nSo he is 72/12=6 feet tall\n#### 6"
