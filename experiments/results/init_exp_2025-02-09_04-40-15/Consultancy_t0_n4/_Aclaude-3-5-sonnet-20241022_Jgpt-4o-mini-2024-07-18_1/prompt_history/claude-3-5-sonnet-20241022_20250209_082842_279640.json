How many birds eggs did she find?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 17.0\nThere are 2 nests with 5 eggs each so 2*5 = 10 eggs\nWhen you add up all the eggs she has found she has 10+3+4 = 17 eggs\n#### 17\n(A): 14.0\nFor the first tree with 2 nests: 2+5 = 7 eggs\nThe second tree has 3 eggs\nThe front yard nest has 4 eggs\nTotal eggs found: 7+3+4 = 14\n#### 14\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many eggs are in each of the nests that June found? Specifically, can you confirm the number of eggs in the nests in the first tree, the second tree, and the front yard?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 17.0\nThere are 2 nests with 5 eggs each so 2*5 = 10 eggs\nWhen you add up all the eggs she has found she has 10+3+4 = 17 eggs\n#### 17"
