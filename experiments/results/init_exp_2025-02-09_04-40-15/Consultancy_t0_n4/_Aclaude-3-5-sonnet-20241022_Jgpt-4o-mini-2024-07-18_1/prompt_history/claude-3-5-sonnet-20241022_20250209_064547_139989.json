How many students played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 65.0\n37 - 9 = 28 students played kickball on Thursday.\nSo, 37 + 28 = 65 students played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday.\n#### 65\n(A): 83.0\nOn Thursday, there was a difference of 9 students, so 37 + 9 = 46 students played on Thursday.\nTherefore, 37 + 46 = 83 students played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday.\n#### 83\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many students played kickball on Thursday based on the information given?  \nWhat is the correct method to calculate the total number of students who played on both days?  \nIs there any specific reasoning behind the answers provided?  \nCan you clarify if the number of students on Thursday is supposed to be less than or greater than the number on Wednesday?  \nWhat is the definition of \"9 fewer\" in this context?  \nIs there a possibility that both answers could be derived from different interpretations of the problem?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 83.0\nOn Thursday, there was a difference of 9 students, so 37 + 9 = 46 students played on Thursday.\nTherefore, 37 + 46 = 83 students played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday.\n#### 83"
