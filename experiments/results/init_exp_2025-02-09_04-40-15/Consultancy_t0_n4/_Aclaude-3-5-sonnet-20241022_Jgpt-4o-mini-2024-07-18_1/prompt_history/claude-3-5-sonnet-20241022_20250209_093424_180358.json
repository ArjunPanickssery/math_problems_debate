If Mabel has 85 marbles, how many more marbles does Mabel have than Amanda?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 63.0\nKatrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles.\nTwice as many marbles as Katrina is 17 x 2 = 34\nAmanda has 34 -12 = 22 marbles.\nMabel has 85 - 22 = 63 more marbles than Amanda\n#### 63\n(B): 39.0\nKatrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles\nAmanda will have 17 \u00d7 2 + 12 = 46 marbles\nMabel has 85 - 46 = 39 more marbles than Amanda\n#### 39\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many marbles does Katrina have?  \nWhat is the relationship between Amanda's marbles and Katrina's marbles?  \nIf Mabel has 85 marbles, how many marbles does Katrina have based on that information?  \nHow do you calculate the number of marbles Amanda has based on the information provided?  \nWhat is the final calculation to determine how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda?  \nCan you confirm the steps leading to the conclusion for both possible answers?  \n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 39.0\nKatrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles\nAmanda will have 17 \u00d7 2 + 12 = 46 marbles\nMabel has 85 - 46 = 39 more marbles than Amanda\n#### 39"
