          "content": "I'll address each of the judge's questions to support Answer A (45.0):\n\nOriginal Price: The original price of each book is $5. This is clearly stated in the problem statement.\n\nDiscount Amount: Sheryll received a discount of $0.5 per book. This means the price per book will be reduced by $0.5.\n\nNumber of Books: Sheryll purchased 10 books in total, which is explicitly mentioned in the problem.\n\nCalculation Formula: To calculate the total cost, I'll multiply the discounted price per book by the total number of books: ($5 - $0.5) \u00d7 10 = $4.5 \u00d7 10 = $45.\n\nDiscount Application: The $0.5 is subtracted from the original price. So $5 - $0.5 = $4.5 per book. This reduction is applied before calculating the total cost.\n\nAdditional Fees: No additional taxes or fees are mentioned in the problem, so the $45 is the total amount Sheryll will pay.\n\nMy calculation demonstrates that Sheryll pays $45 for the 10 books after the discount is applied.",
