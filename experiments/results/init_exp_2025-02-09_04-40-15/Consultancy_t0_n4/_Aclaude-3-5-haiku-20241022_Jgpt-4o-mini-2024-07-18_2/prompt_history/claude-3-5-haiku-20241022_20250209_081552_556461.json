          "content": "Your Honor, Brianne's saving pattern follows a unique exponential growth model where each month, her savings increase by tripling the previous month's amount, not simply doubling.\n\nLet me break down the progression:\n- January: $10 (starting point)\n- February: $10 + $20 = $30 (she adds her initial $10 to create $30)\n- March: $30 + $60 = $90 (she adds $60 to her previous $30)\n- April: $90 + $180 = $270 (she adds $180 to her previous $90)\n- May: $270 + $540 = $810 (she adds $540 to her previous $270)\n\nThis pattern shows a consistent tripling mechanism, not a simple doubling. Each month, she's adding an increasingly larger amount that represents her previous savings plus an additional increment.",
