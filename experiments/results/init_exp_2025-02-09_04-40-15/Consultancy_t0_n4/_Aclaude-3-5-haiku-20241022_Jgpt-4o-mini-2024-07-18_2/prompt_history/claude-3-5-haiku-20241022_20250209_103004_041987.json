So for the first tree, the total is 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. \n\nIn the second tree, there is 1 nest with 3 eggs.\n\nIn the front yard, there is 1 nest with 4 eggs.\n\nWhen we add these together: 10 + 3 + 4 = 14 eggs total. \n\nI'm confident in these calculations and can break down each nest's egg count precisely as I've described.",
