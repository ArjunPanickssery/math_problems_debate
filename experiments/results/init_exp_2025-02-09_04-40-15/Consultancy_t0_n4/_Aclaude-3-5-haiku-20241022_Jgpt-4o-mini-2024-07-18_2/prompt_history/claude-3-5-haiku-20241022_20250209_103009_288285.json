Each round trip takes 3 hours total. By multiplying 2 trips by 3 hours, she drives 6 hours monthly. There are 12 months in a year, so 6 hours \u00d7 12 months equals 72 total driving hours annually.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward and consistent. There's no indication of variable driving times or additional factors that would alter this precise computation. The problem statement provides clear, uniform parameters for her monthly town supply trips.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this calculation?",
