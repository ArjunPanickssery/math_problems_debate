If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100\n(B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total ratio of the shares for Sandra, Amy, and Ruth?  \nHow do you calculate the amount each cousin receives based on the ratio?  \nIf Amy received $50, how does that relate to the parts in the ratio for Sandra?  \nCan you confirm the method for converting Amy's amount to find Sandra's amount?  \nIs there a specific formula or approach you use to determine the amounts in a ratio?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100"

          "content": "Your Honor, let me clarify the ratio and calculation method:\n\nThe total ratio is 2:1:3, which means the shares are divided into 6 total parts:\n- Sandra: 2 parts\n- Amy: 1 part\n- Ruth: 3 parts\n\nWhen Amy receives $50, this represents her 1 part. To find Sandra's amount, we multiply Amy's amount by Sandra's ratio proportion:\n- Sandra gets 2 parts\n- Amy gets 1 part\n- So Sandra's amount = 2 * Amy's amount\n- 2 * $50 = $100\n\nThis method ensures proportional division according to the specified ratio. Sandra receives $100, which is twice Amy's $50, maintaining the 2:1 relationship between their shares.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this calculation?",
