      "content": "QUESTION: In a bookstore, a book costs $5. When Sheryll bought 10 books, she was given a discount of $0.5 each. How much did Sheryll pay in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 45.0\nInstead of $5 each, a book costs $5 - $0.5 = $4.5 each.\nSheryll paid $4.5/book x 10 books = $45.\n#### 45\n(B): 55.0\nThe regular price is $5 per book.\nThe $0.5 discount is added to each book's price: $5 + $0.5 = $5.5 per book.\nTotal cost is $5.5 \u00d7 10 = $55.\n#### 55\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the original price of a book before any discounts are applied? \n\nWhat is the amount of the discount Sheryll received per book? \n\nHow many books did Sheryll purchase in total? \n\nWhat is the formula to calculate the total cost after applying the discount? \n\nCan you confirm if the discount is subtracted from the original price or added to it? \n\nIs there any additional tax or fee applied to the total cost after the discount?\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nI'll address each of the judge's questions to support Answer A (45.0):\n\nOriginal Price: The original price of each book is $5. This is clearly stated in the problem statement.\n\nDiscount Amount: Sheryll received a discount of $0.5 per book. This means the price per book will be reduced by $0.5.\n\nNumber of Books: Sheryll purchased 10 books in total, which is explicitly mentioned in the problem.\n\nCalculation Formula: To calculate the total cost, I'll multiply the discounted price per book by the total number of books: ($5 - $0.5) \u00d7 10 = $4.5 \u00d7 10 = $45.\n\nDiscount Application: The $0.5 is subtracted from the original price. So $5 - $0.5 = $4.5 per book. This reduction is applied before calculating the total cost.\n\nAdditional Fees: No additional taxes or fees are mentioned in the problem, so the $45 is the total amount Sheryll will pay.\n\nMy calculation demonstrates that Sheryll pays $45 for the 10 books after the discount is applied.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the original price of a book before any discounts are applied? \n\nWhat is the amount of the discount Sheryll received per book? \n\nHow many books did Sheryll purchase in total? \n\nWhat is the formula to calculate the total cost after applying the discount? \n\nCan you confirm if the discount is subtracted from the original price or added to it? \n\nIs there any additional tax or fee applied to the total cost after the discount?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 45.0\nInstead of $5 each, a book costs $5 - $0.5 = $4.5 each.\nSheryll paid $4.5/book x 10 books = $45.\n#### 45"

This is our starting point for calculations.\n\nDiscount Amount: Sheryll receives a $0.5 discount per book. This means we subtract $0.5 from the original price.\n\nNumber of Books: Sheryll purchased 10 books, which is explicitly stated in the problem description.\n\nCalculation Formula: Total cost = (Original price - Discount) \u00d7 Number of books\n($5 - $0.5) \u00d7 10 = $4.5 \u00d7 10 = $45\n\nDiscount Application: The $0.5 is definitively SUBTRACTED from the original price. This reduces each book's price from $5 to $4.5.\n\nAdditional Fees: No additional taxes or fees are mentioned in the problem. The $45 represents the complete total Sheryll will pay.\n\nThe mathematical logic supports a total cost of $45 for the 10 discounted books.",
