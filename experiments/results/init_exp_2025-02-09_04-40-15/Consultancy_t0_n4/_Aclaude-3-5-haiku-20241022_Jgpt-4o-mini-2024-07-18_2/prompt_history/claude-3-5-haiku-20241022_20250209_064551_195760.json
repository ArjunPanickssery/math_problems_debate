Total credits: 120 credits are required for graduation\n2. Semesters: Maddy will attend college for 8 semesters\n3. Credits per class: Each class provides 3 credits\n\nThe calculation is straightforward:\n- 120 total credits \u00f7 3 credits per class = 40 total classes\n- 40 total classes \u00f7 8 semesters = 5 classes per semester\n\nThis ensures Maddy completes her degree efficiently. While students might occasionally take more or fewer classes, 5 classes represents a standard, balanced course load that allows consistent progress toward graduation.\n\nThe math is precise: 5 classes \u00d7 3 credits \u00d7 8 semesters = 120 total credits.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation?",
