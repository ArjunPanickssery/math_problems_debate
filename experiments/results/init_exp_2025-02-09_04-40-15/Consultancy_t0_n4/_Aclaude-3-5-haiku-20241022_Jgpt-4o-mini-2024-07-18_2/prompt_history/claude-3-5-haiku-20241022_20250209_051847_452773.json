Mr. Phung has 16 more silver dollars than Mr. Chiu. So to determine Mr. Phung's silver dollars, I add 16 to Mr. Chiu's 56 silver dollars. This straightforward calculation results in 72 silver dollars for Mr. Phung. The step-by-step arithmetic shows that 56 + 16 = 72, which directly answers how many silver dollars Mr. Phung possesses.",
