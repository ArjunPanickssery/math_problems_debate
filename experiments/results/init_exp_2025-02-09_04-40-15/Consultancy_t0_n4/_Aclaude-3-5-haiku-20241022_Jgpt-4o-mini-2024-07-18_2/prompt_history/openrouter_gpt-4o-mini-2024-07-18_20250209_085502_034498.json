      "content": "QUESTION: Eddy\u2019s spider plant produces 2 baby plants 2 times a year.  After 4 years, how many baby plants will the mother plant have produced?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 16.0\nThe mother plant produces 2 baby plants 2 times a year so it produces 2*2 = 4 plants a year\nIt produces 4 plants a year so after 4 years it will produce 4*4 = 16 baby plants\n#### 16\n(B): 30.0\nThe mother plant produces 2 babies twice per year\nIn the first year we get 2 babies from the first time\nThen we add 2 more from the second time that year\nIn the second year we get 4 more total\nIn the third year we get 8 more total\nIn the fourth year we get 16 more total\nAdding all babies: 2 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30 baby plants\n#### 30\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many baby plants does Eddy\u2019s spider plant produce in one year?\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nYour Honor, Eddy's spider plant produces 4 baby plants per year. This is because the plant generates 2 baby plants twice annually. In the first occurrence, 2 baby plants are produced, and in the second occurrence of the same year, another 2 baby plants are produced, totaling 4 baby plants per year. This consistent biannual reproduction pattern is key to understanding the plant's reproductive cycle.\n"
