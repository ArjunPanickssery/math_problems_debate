Currently, the dog is 2 years old. This is because in two years, the dog will turn 4 years old. By subtracting those 2 future years from 4, we confirm the dog is 2 years old now.\n\nCorrespondingly, my current age is 17 years old. I started at 15 when the dog was born, and have since aged 2 years to reach 17.\n\nThe age progression is linear and consistent: \n- My age: 15 \u2192 17\n- Dog's age: 0 \u2192 2\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this timeline?",
