          "content": "I'll respond to the judge's inquiries to support the answer of 4 bars:\n\nYour Honor, when 12 chocolate bars are divided equally among 3 people, each person receives exactly 4 bars through simple division (12 \u00f7 3 = 4). The term \"shared equally\" means a precise, mathematical distribution where each person gets an identical number of bars. There are no fractional or uneven portions.\n\nRegarding Mike and Rita specifically, they together receive 4 bars total. This follows directly from the equal distribution principle - Mike gets 4 bars, Rita gets 4 bars, and Anita also gets 4 bars. The mathematical calculation is straightforward and leaves no room for alternative interpretations.\n\nThe division is complete, with no remainder or leftover bars. Each person receives their fair, equal share of 4 chocolate bars.",
