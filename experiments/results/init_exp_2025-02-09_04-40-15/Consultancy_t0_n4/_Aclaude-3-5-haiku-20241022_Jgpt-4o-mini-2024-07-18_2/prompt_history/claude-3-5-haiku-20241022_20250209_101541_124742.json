If their grandmother has 50 dolls, how many dolls do they have altogether?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 258.0\nIf the grandmother has 50 dolls, Rene's sister, who has 2 more dolls than their grandmother, has 50+2 = 52 dolls.\nTogether, Rene's sister and the grandmother have 52+50 = 102 dolls.\nSince Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, she has 52*3 = 156 dolls.\nAltogether, they have 156+102 = 258 dolls.\n#### 258\n(B): 658.0\nStarting with grandmother's 50 dolls, we first multiply by 3 to get 150.\nAdding 2 gives us the sister's number of dolls: 152.\nSince Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, she has 152*3 = 456 dolls.\nThe total number of dolls is therefore 50+152+456 = 658.\n#### 658\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total number of dolls that Rene's sister has based on the information provided?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 258.0\nIf the grandmother has 50 dolls, Rene's sister, who has 2 more dolls than their grandmother, has 50+2 = 52 dolls.\nTogether, Rene's sister and the grandmother have 52+50 = 102 dolls.\nSince Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, she has 52*3 = 156 dolls.\nAltogether, they have 156+102 = 258 dolls.\n#### 258"

Here's how I arrived at this number:\n\nThe grandmother has 50 dolls, and the problem states that Rene's sister has two more dolls than the grandmother. So, we calculate 50 + 2 = 52 dolls for Rene's sister. This calculation directly follows from the given information that the sister has two more dolls than their grandmother's 50 dolls.\n\nThe mathematical steps are straightforward: 50 (grandmother's dolls) + 2 = 52 (Rene's sister's dolls). This precise calculation supports the answer that Rene's sister has 52 dolls.",
