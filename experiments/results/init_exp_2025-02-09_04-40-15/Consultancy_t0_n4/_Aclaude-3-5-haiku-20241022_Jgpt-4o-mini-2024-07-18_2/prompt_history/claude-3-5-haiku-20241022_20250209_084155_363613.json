          "content": "I'll address the judge's inquiries systematically to support Answer A (25.0):\n\n1. Total students in Biology class:\nThe Physics class has 200 students, and the Biology class has half that number, which is 100 students. This is a clear, straightforward calculation based on the problem statement.\n\n2. Ratio of girls to boys:\nThe problem states there are three times as many girls as boys. This means the class is divided into 4 parts: 3 parts girls and 1 part boys. \n\n3. Number of boys with 100 total students:\nIf the class is divided into 4 parts (3 girls, 1 boy), then boys represent 1/4 of the total. 1/4 of 100 is precisely 25 boys.\n\n4. Calculation method:\nBy dividing the total students (100) by 4 and taking the part representing boys (1/4), we directly calculate 25 boys.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific point?",
