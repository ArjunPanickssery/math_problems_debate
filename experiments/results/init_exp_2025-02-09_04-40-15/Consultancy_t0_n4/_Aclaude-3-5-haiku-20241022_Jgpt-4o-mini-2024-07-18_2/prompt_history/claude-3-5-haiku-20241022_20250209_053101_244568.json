This means Albert's book collection is precisely four times larger than Stu's collection. When we add Stu's 9 books to Albert's 36 books, we get a total of 45 books. The mathematical relationship is clear: 4 multiplied by Stu's book count gives us Albert's book count, and then adding these together results in 45 total books.",
