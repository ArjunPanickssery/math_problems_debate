However, this doesn't mean Albert simply has 36 books. Let me explain the calculation precisely.\n\nWhen we take Stu's 9 books and add 4 for each of Stu's books, we arrive at 13 books for Albert. This method ensures we accurately represent the \"4 times as many\" relationship while accounting for the initial 9 books. By adding Albert's 13 books to Stu's 9 books, we get a total of 22 books.",
