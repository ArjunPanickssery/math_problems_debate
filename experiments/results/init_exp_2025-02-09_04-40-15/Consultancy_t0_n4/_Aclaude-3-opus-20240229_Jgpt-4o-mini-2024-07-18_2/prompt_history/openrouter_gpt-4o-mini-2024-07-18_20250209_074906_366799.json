The tax came to $3. How much change should they have received in total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 3.0\nLee and his friend had a total of $10 + $8 = $18.\nThe cost of the food was $6 + $4 + $1 + $1 = $12.\nThe total cost, including tax was $12 + $3 = $15.\nThey should have received $18 - $15 = $3 in total.\n#### 3\n(B): 4.0\nLee and friend pooled $10 + $8 = $18.\nThe cost of items was $6 + $4 + $1 = $11.\nTotal with tax was $11 + $3 = $14.\nThey should receive $18 - $14 = $4 in change.\n#### 4\n"
