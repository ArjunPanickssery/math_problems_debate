      "content": "QUESTION: John buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students.  He has 6 classes and 30 students in each class.  How many packs did he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 360.0\nJohn has 6*30=180 students\nSo he bought 180*2=360 packs\n#### 360\n(A): 12.0\nCalculate number of classes: 6\nMultiply by 2 packs per class: 6*2=12\n#### 12\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many index cards are in each pack?  \nIs the number of students in each class relevant to the number of packs John bought?  \nDid John buy 2 packs in total or 2 packs for each class?  \nWhat is the total number of students John has across all classes?  \nHow many packs does John need to accommodate all students?\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nJohn needs to buy 2 packs of index cards for each of his 180 students. Since he has 6 classes with 30 students per class, the total number of students is 6 * 30 = 180. If he buys 2 packs per student, the total number of packs will be 180 * 2 = 360 packs. The key is understanding that the 2 packs are per student, not per class. This ensures every student receives the necessary index cards for their coursework, making 360 packs the correct solution.\n"
