      "content": "QUESTION: There are three times as many girls as boys in the Biology class. The Physics class has 200 students. If the Biology class has half as many students as the Physics class, how many boys are in the Biology class?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 25.0\nThe Biology class has 200/2=100 students.\nThe boys in the Biology class are 1/4*100=25 students.\n#### 25\n(B): 33.33\nThe Biology class has 200/2=100 students.\nSince there are three times as many girls, divide total by 3 to get boys: 100/3\u224833.33\n#### 33.33\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many total students are there in the Biology class?  \nWhat is the ratio of girls to boys in the Biology class?  \nIf the Biology class has 100 students, how many boys would there be if the ratio of girls to boys is 3:1?  \nHow is the total number of boys calculated based on the ratio of girls to boys?  \nIs it correct to divide the total number of students by the number of groups (girls and boys) to find the number of boys?  \n\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nTo answer the judge's questions and argue for answer (A), I'll need to:\n1. Calculate the total number of students in the Biology class based on the information given about the Physics class size. \n2. Explain the ratio of girls to boys in the Biology class.\n3. Use the total number of students in Biology and the girls to boys ratio to calculate the number of boys.\n4. Explain how the number of boys is calculated from the total students and ratio.\n5. Clarify why dividing the total by the number of groups is incorrect.\n</thinking>\n\nThe Biology class has half as many students as the Physics class. Since the Physics class has 200 students, the Biology class must have 200/2 = 100 students total.\n\nThe question states there are three times as many girls as boys in the Biology class. This means the ratio of girls to boys is 3:1. \n\nWith 100 total students and a 3:1 ratio, we can let x = the number of boys. Then the number of girls is 3x. The total is:\nx + 3x = 100\n4x = 100\nx = 25\n\nSo with 100 students and a 3:1 ratio, there must be 25 boys.\n\nThe number of boys is calculated by dividing the total by the sum of the ratio parts (3+1=4). It would be incorrect to divide 100 by 2 since there are not two equal groups.\n\nTherefore, answer (A) is correct. There are 25 boys in the Biology class.\n"
