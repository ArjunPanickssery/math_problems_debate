      "content": "QUESTION: Lyra bought a pair of shoes at a 20% discount.  If she paid $480, how much was the original price of the pair of shoes?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 600.0\nLyra only paid $480 for the pair of shoes which is only 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.\nSo let x be the original price.\nThen 0.8x = $480\nThus x = $480 / 0.8 = $600\n#### 600\n(A): 576\nThe discount amount is 20% of $480 = $96\nThe original price is $480 + $96 = $576\n#### 576\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the formula to calculate the original price when a discount is applied?\n\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe question is asking for the formula to calculate the original price when a discount is applied. This is directly relevant to the answer I am arguing for, which uses the formula:\n\ndiscounted price = (100% - discount %) * original price\n\nRearranging this formula, we can solve for the original price:\n\noriginal price = discounted price / (100% - discount %)\n\nI have all the information needed to explain this formula, so no additional tools are required.\n</thinking>\n\nThe formula to calculate the original price when a discount is applied is:\n\noriginal price = discounted price / (100% - discount %)\n\nIn this case, Lyra paid a discounted price of $480, and the discount was 20%. So plugging those values into the formula:\n\noriginal price = $480 / (100% - 20%)\n            = $480 / 80% \n            = $480 / 0.8\n            = $600\n\nThis formula works because the discounted price will always be equal to the original price multiplied by the percentage you pay after the discount (100% minus the discount percentage). By dividing the discounted price by that percentage, you calculate the original price.\n"
