      "content": "QUESTION: A farmer gets 20 pounds of bacon on average from a pig. He sells each pound for $6 at the monthly farmer\u2019s market. This month\u2019s pig is a runt that grew to only half the size of the average pig. How many dollars will the farmer make from the pig\u2019s bacon?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nThe pig grew to half the size of the average pig, so it will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nThe rancher will make 10 * 6 = $60 from the pig\u2019s bacon.\n#### 60\n(A): 30.0\nThe pig will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nEach pound will sell for 6 / 2 = $3.\nThe farmer will make 10 * 3 = $30 from the pig's bacon.\n#### 30\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow much bacon does an average pig produce?  \nWhat is the selling price per pound of bacon?  \nIf the pig is half the size, how much bacon will it produce?  \nIs the selling price per pound affected by the size of the pig?  \nWhat is the total revenue calculation for the bacon from the runt pig?  \nIs there any reason to believe the farmer would sell the bacon for a different price than usual?  \n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 60.0\nThe pig grew to half the size of the average pig, so it will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nThe rancher will make 10 * 6 = $60 from the pig\u2019s bacon.\n#### 60"

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key information needed to answer this question is:\n1. The amount of bacon an average pig produces (20 pounds)\n2. The selling price per pound of bacon ($6)\n3. The size of this month's pig relative to average (half the size)\n4. How the pig's smaller size affects the amount of bacon it produces (will produce half as much)\n\nAll of this information is directly provided in the question. No additional tools are needed.\n\nThe question does not indicate that the selling price per pound would be affected by the size of the pig. So we can assume the $6 per pound price still applies.\n\nTo calculate the total revenue, we need to:\n1. Determine the pounds of bacon from the half-size pig \n2. Multiply the pounds of bacon by the price per pound\n\nNo missing information that requires asking the user for more details.\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the question, an average pig produces 20 pounds of bacon, which the farmer sells for $6 per pound. This month's pig is only half the normal size, so it will produce half as much bacon as usual:",
