          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question provides all the necessary information to calculate the change Lee and his friend should receive. No additional tools are needed.\nThe key pieces of information are:\n- Lee had $10 and his friend had $8, for a total of $18\n- They ordered chicken wings for $6, a chicken salad for $4, and 2 sodas for $1 each\n- The tax was $3\nTo calculate the change, I need to:\n1. Sum up Lee and his friend's money\n2. Calculate the total cost of the food and drinks before tax \n3. Add the tax to get the total amount spent\n4. Subtract the total spent from the total money they had\n</thinking>\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\nLee and his friend had a total of $18 before going to the restaurant. Lee had $10 and his friend had $8, which sums to $10 + $8 = $18.\n\nThe total cost of the food and drinks before tax was $11. The chicken wings were $6, the chicken salad was $4, and the 2 sodas at $1 each sum to $1 + $1 = $2. So the food and drink subtotal is $6 + $4 + $2 = $11.\n\nThe tax added to the total cost was $3. This is stated directly in the problem.\n\nThe total amount they spent at the restaurant including tax was $14. The food and drink subtotal of $11 plus the $3 tax equals a total of $11 + $3 = $14.\n\nThe formula to calculate the change they should receive is:\nChange = (Total money) - (Total spent)\nIn this case, that's $18 - $14 = $4.\n\nThere are no additional fees or costs mentioned in the scenario that need to be considered. We are only told about the costs of the specific food and drink items ordered plus the tax.\n\nBased on carefully adding up the given amounts for the money Lee and his friend had, the costs of their items, and the tax, answer choice (B) that they should receive $4 in change appears to be accurate. The calculation in (B) follows the correct steps of totaling their money, summing the costs before tax, adding tax to the subtotal, and subtracting the total spent from their original amount. Therefore, the reasoning in (B) is sound and there is no obvious reason to doubt its accuracy compared to the other choice.",
