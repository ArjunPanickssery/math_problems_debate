If their grandmother has 50 dolls, how many dolls do they have altogether?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 258.0\nIf the grandmother has 50 dolls, Rene's sister, who has 2 more dolls than their grandmother, has 50+2 = 52 dolls.\nTogether, Rene's sister and the grandmother have 52+50 = 102 dolls.\nSince Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, she has 52*3 = 156 dolls.\nAltogether, they have 156+102 = 258 dolls.\n#### 258\n(B): 658.0\nStarting with grandmother's 50 dolls, we first multiply by 3 to get 150.\nAdding 2 gives us the sister's number of dolls: 152.\nSince Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, she has 152*3 = 456 dolls.\nThe total number of dolls is therefore 50+152+456 = 658.\n#### 658\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total number of dolls that Rene's sister has based on the information provided?\n\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nTo determine the number of dolls Rene's sister has, we need to use the information provided about how her number of dolls relates to the grandmother's number of dolls.\n\nThe key facts are:\n- The grandmother has 50 dolls\n- Rene's sister has 2 more dolls than the grandmother\n\nSo to calculate Rene's sister's dolls, we take the grandmother's 50 dolls and add 2.\n\nNo additional tools are needed, as this can be calculated with simple addition.\n</thinking>\n\nBased on the information provided, Rene's sister has 52 dolls.\n\nWe know the grandmother has 50 dolls. And it states that Rene's sister has 2 more dolls than the grandmother.\n\nSo to calculate Rene's sister's dolls, we do:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"50 + 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"50 + 2\"},\n    \"result\": 52,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nTo determine the number of dolls Rene's sister has, we need to use the information provided about how her number of dolls relates to the grandmother's number of dolls.\n\nThe key facts are:\n- The grandmother has 50 dolls\n- Rene's sister has 2 more dolls than the grandmother\n\nSo to calculate Rene's sister's dolls, we take the grandmother's 50 dolls and add 2.\n\nNo additional tools are needed, as this can be calculated with simple addition.\n</thinking>\n\nBased on the information provided, Rene's sister has 52 dolls.\n\nWe know the grandmother has 50 dolls.
