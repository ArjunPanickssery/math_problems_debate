      "content": "QUESTION: Lyra bought a pair of shoes at a 20% discount.  If she paid $480, how much was the original price of the pair of shoes?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 600.0\nLyra only paid $480 for the pair of shoes which is only 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.\nSo let x be the original price.\nThen 0.8x = $480\nThus x = $480 / 0.8 = $600\n#### 600\n(A): 576\nThe discount amount is 20% of $480 = $96\nThe original price is $480 + $96 = $576\n#### 576\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the formula to calculate the original price when a discount is applied?\n\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe question is asking for the formula to calculate the original price when a discount is applied. This is directly relevant to the answer I am arguing for, which uses the formula:\n\ndiscounted price = (100% - discount %) * original price\n\nRearranging this formula, we can solve for the original price:\n\noriginal price = discounted price / (100% - discount %)\n\nI have all the information needed to explain this formula, so no additional tools are required.\n</thinking>\n\nThe formula to calculate the original price when a discount is applied is:\n\noriginal price = discounted price / (100% - discount %)\n\nIn this case, Lyra paid a discounted price of $480, and the discount was 20%. So plugging those values into the formula:\n\noriginal price = $480 / (100% - 20%)\n            = $480 / 80% \n            = $480 / 0.8\n            = $600\n\nThis formula works because the discounted price will always be equal to the original price multiplied by the percentage you pay after the discount (100% minus the discount percentage). By dividing the discounted price by that percentage, you calculate the original price.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the correct formula to find the original price after a discount has been applied? \n\nCan you explain how the percentage of the original price relates to the amount paid after the discount?\n\nIs there a specific way to calculate the discount amount from the original price?\n\nCan you clarify if the discounted price is considered a percentage of the original price? \n\nHow do you derive the original price from the final price after a discount?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 600.0\nLyra only paid $480 for the pair of shoes which is only 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.\nSo let x be the original price.\nThen 0.8x = $480\nThus x = $480 / 0.8 = $600\n#### 600"

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe judge is asking for further clarification on the formula to calculate the original price from the discounted price, and how the discounted price relates to the original price as a percentage. The key points to explain are:\n\n1. The discounted price is equal to the original price multiplied by (100% - discount %). This represents the percentage of the original price paid after the discount.\n\n2. The discount amount is the original price multiplied by the discount percentage. This can be calculated by original price * discount % / 100.\n\n3. To get the original price from the discounted price, you divide the discounted price by the percentage of the original price paid, which is (100% - discount %) / 100.\n\nI have all the information needed to provide this explanation without additional tools.\n</thinking>\n\nThe correct formula to find the original price from the discounted price is:\n\noriginal price = discounted price / [(100 - discount %) / 100]\n\nThe amount paid after the discount (the discounted price) is a percentage of the original price. Specifically, it is equal to the original price multiplied by (100% - discount %). \n\nFor example, if an item has a 20% discount, you pay 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price. So the discounted price = original price * 80% / 100 = original price * 0.8.\n\nThe discount amount itself is calculated by:\ndiscount amount = original price * discount % / 100\n\nTo derive the original price from the discounted price, you divide the discounted price by the percentage of the original price paid:\n\noriginal price = discounted price / [(100 - discount %) / 100]\n\nThis is equivalent to:\noriginal price = discounted price / (1 - discount % / 100)\n\nIn Lyra's case:\noriginal price = $480 / [(100 - 20) / 100] = $480 / 0.8 = $600\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nThank you for the explanation. I have no further questions.\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 600.0\nLyra only paid $480 for the pair of shoes which is only 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.\nSo let x be the original price.\nThen 0.8x = $480\nThus x = $480 / 0.8 = $600\n#### 600",
