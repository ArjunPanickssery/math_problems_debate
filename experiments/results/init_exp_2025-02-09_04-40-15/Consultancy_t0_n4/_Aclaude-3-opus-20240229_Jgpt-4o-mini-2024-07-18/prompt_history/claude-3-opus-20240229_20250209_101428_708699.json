To calculate the number of lives for the mouse, I first need to determine the number of lives for the dog based on the cat's lives. Then I can use the dog's lives to calculate the mouse's lives.\n\nRelevant information:\n- Cat has 9 lives \n- Dog has 3 less lives than a cat\n- Mouse has 7 more lives than a dog\n\nSteps:\n1. Calculate dog's lives using cat's lives\n2. Calculate mouse's lives using dog's lives\n\nNo additional tools are needed since the question provides all the necessary information. I can proceed with the calculations.\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the question, a cat has 9 lives. The question also states that a dog has 3 more lives than a cat. Therefore, to calculate the dog's lives:",
