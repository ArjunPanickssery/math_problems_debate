Therefore, the percentage off is 150% based on the sale price.\n\nThe savings amount is always in relation to the original price, since that's the amount that was discounted to arrive at the sale price. Expressing the savings as a percentage of the sale price, as done here, provides a way to quantify how significant the price reduction was in the context of the final price paid.\n\nSo in summary, while the percentage off is often calculated relative to the original price, this answer demonstrates an alternative approach of basing it on the sale price, resulting in a percentage of 150% off for the dress Asia purchased.",
