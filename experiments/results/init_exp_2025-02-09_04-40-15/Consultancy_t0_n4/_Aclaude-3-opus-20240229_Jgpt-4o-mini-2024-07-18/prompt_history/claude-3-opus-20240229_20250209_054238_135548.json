          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key information needed to answer this question is:\n- Original price of a book before discount\n- Amount of discount per book\n- Number of books purchased\n- Formula to calculate total cost after discount\nThe question provides all of this information directly, so no additional tools are needed. The judge's questions can be answered using the details in the original question.\n</thinking>\n\nTo address your questions:\n\nThe original price of a book before any discounts are applied is $5. This is clearly stated in the question.\n\nThe amount of the discount Sheryll received per book is $0.5. The question specifies \"she was given a discount of $0.5 each\" when buying the books.\n\nSheryll purchased a total of 10 books. The question states \"When Sheryll bought 10 books\".\n\nThe formula to calculate the total cost after applying the discount is:\n(Original price - Discount) \u00d7 Number of books\nIn this case, that's ($5 - $0.5) \u00d7 10\n\nThe question confirms the $0.5 discount is subtracted from the original $5 price, resulting in a discounted price of $4.5 per book.\n\nThere is no mention of any additional tax or fee beyond the discounted price, so we can assume the $45 total accounts for the entire cost.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A). At a discounted price of $4.5 per book, purchasing 10 books results in Sheryll paying $45 in total.",
