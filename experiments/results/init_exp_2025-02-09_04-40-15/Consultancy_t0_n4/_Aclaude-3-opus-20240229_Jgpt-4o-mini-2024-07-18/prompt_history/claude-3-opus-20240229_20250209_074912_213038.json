      "content": "QUESTION: It takes 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit. If Lydia planted a tree when she was 4 years old and is now 9 years old, how old would she be when she gets to eat an apple from her tree for the first time?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 11.0\nThe tree has been planted for 9 - 4 = 5 years\nIt will take another 7 - 5 = 2 years for it to bear fruit\nLydia will be 9 + 2 = 11 years old\n#### 11\n(B): 16.0\nStarting from her current age of 9\nIt takes 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit\nHer age will be 9 + 7 = 16 when she can eat the apples\n#### 16\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow old was Lydia when she planted the tree?  \nHow many years has the tree been growing since it was planted?  \nHow many more years does it need to grow before it bears fruit?  \nWhat is Lydia's current age?  \nHow do you calculate Lydia's age when the tree bears fruit?  \nIs there any possibility that the tree could bear fruit sooner than expected?  \nAre there any factors that could delay the fruit-bearing process of the tree?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 11.0\nThe tree has been planted for 9 - 4 = 5 years\nIt will take another 7 - 5 = 2 years for it to bear fruit\nLydia will be 9 + 2 = 11 years old\n#### 11"
