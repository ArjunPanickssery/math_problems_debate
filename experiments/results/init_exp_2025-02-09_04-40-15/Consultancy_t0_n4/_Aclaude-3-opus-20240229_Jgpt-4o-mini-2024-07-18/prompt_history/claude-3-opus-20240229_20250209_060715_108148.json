The question is specifically asking about the number of insects remaining in the playground. \n\nSpiders belong to the class Arachnida, while insects are in the class Insecta. Some key differences:\n\n- Spiders have 8 legs, while insects have 6 legs\n- Spiders have 2 body segments (cephalothorax and abdomen), while insects have 3 (head, thorax, abdomen)\n- Spiders don't have antennae, while insects do\n\nSince the question is focused on counting insects, we should only include the ants and ladybugs in the total. The 3 spiders Sami found are arachnids and should be excluded from the insect count.",
