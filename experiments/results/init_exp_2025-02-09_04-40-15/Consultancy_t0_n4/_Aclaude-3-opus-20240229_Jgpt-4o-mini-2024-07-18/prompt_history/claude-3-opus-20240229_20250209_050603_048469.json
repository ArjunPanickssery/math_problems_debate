How much does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50\n(A): 100.0\nFirst calculate what fraction remains: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\nSince 2/3 was spent, multiply $150 by 2/3: $150 * (2/3) = $100\nThis is the amount she has left.\n#### 100\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total amount the housewife started with?  \nHow much did she spend in dollar terms?  \nWhat is the correct way to calculate the remaining amount after spending?  \nCan you confirm the fractions used in the calculations?  \nIs it possible that the housewife has spent more than she had?  \nHow do you interpret the fractions in the context of the total amount?  \nAre there any common mistakes people make in similar calculations?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50"

She spent 2/3 of that $150, which needs to be calculated in dollar terms\n3. To find the remaining amount, we need to subtract the spent amount from the total\n4. Need to confirm the fractions are being used correctly - 2/3 spent means 1/3 remains\n5. It's not possible she spent more than she had based on the given information\n6. The fractions represent portions of the total $150\n7. A common mistake could be to multiply the remaining fraction by the total instead of subtracting the spent amount\n</thinking>\n\nTo address your questions:\n\nThe housewife started with a total of $150. This is clearly stated in the problem.\n\nIn dollar terms, she spent 2/3 of $150. We can calculate this as:",
