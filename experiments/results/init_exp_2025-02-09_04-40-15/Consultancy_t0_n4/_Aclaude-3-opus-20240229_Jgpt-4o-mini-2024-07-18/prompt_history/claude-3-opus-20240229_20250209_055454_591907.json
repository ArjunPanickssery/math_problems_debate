For the next rows, he has 2 less than the blocks he has from its bottom row. How many blocks did he use in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 25.0\nOn the second row, he used 9 - 2 = 7 blocks.\nOn the third row, he used 7 - 2 = 5 blocks.\nOn the fourth row, he used 5 - 2 = 3 blocks.\nOn the fifth row, he used 3 - 2 = 1 block.\nTherefore, he used a total of 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 25 blocks.\n#### 25\n(A): 37.0\nThe first row has 9 blocks.\nEach subsequent row should have 2 less than the first row, so they each have 7 blocks.\nTherefore, we have one row of 9 blocks and four rows of 7 blocks.\nThe total number of blocks is 9 + (4 \u00d7 7) = 9 + 28 = 37 blocks.\n#### 37\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many blocks are in each row of the pyramid? Specifically, can you confirm the pattern of decreasing blocks in each row? \n\nIs the first row indeed 9 blocks, and does each subsequent row decrease by 2 blocks? \n\nHow many rows are there in total, and what is the exact calculation for the total number of blocks used? \n\nCould you clarify if the second row has 7 blocks, the third row has 5 blocks, the fourth row has 3 blocks, and the fifth row has 1 block? \n\nIs there any possibility of misunderstanding the arrangement of blocks in the pyramid?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 25.0\nOn the second row, he used 9 - 2 = 7 blocks.\nOn the third row, he used 7 - 2 = 5 blocks.\nOn the fourth row, he used 5 - 2 = 3 blocks.\nOn the fifth row, he used 3 - 2 = 1 block.\nTherefore, he used a total of 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 25 blocks.\n#### 25"

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key points to clarify based on the judge's questions are:\n1. The exact number of blocks in each row, confirming the pattern of decreasing by 2 blocks per row\n2. The total number of rows in the pyramid\n3. The calculation for the total number of blocks\n4. Eliminate any possibility of misunderstanding the pyramid arrangement\n</thinking>\n\nYes, I can confirm the pyramid has 5 rows total, with the number of blocks decreasing by 2 in each subsequent row:\n\nRow 1 (bottom): 9 blocks\nRow 2: 9 - 2 = 7 blocks  \nRow 3: 7 - 2 = 5 blocks\nRow 4: 5 - 2 = 3 blocks\nRow 5 (top): 3 - 2 = 1 block\n\nTo calculate the total, we sum the number of blocks in each row:\n\n9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 25 total blocks\n\nThe problem statement is clear that each row decreases by 2 blocks compared to the row below it, starting with 9 blocks in the bottom row. There is no ambiguity in how the blocks are arranged to form the 5-level pyramid. Therefore, the total of 25 blocks used is the correct answer.",
