      "content": "QUESTION: Hilary is shucking corn from ears that grew on her farm. She gets four ears of corn per stalk, and she has 108 stalks growing. Half the ears of corn have 500 kernels of corn and the other half have 100 more. How many kernels of corn does Hilary have to shuck?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 237600.0\nShe has 108 * 4 = 432 ears of corn to shuck.\nShe gets 500 kernels of corn from half the ears and 500 + 100 = 600 kernels from the other half.\nHalf the number of ears of corn is 432 / 2 = 216 ears.\nThus, Hilary has 216 * 500 + 216 * 600 = 108000 + 129600 = 237600 kernels to shuck.\n#### 237600\n(B): 259200\nShe has 108 * 4 = 432 ears of corn to shuck.\nEach ear of corn has 500 kernels as a base amount.\nAdding the additional 100 kernels to each ear gives 600 kernels per ear.\nThus, Hilary has 432 * 600 = 259200 kernels to shuck.\n#### 259200\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many ears of corn does Hilary have in total?  \nWhat is the distribution of kernels between the two types of ears?  \nCan you clarify how the additional 100 kernels are applied to the ears?  \nIs the calculation for the total kernels based on the average or total number of kernels from both types of ears?  \nWhat is the formula used to calculate the total number of kernels?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 237600.0\nShe has 108 * 4 = 432 ears of corn to shuck.\nShe gets 500 kernels of corn from half the ears and 500 + 100 = 600 kernels from the other half.\nHalf the number of ears of corn is 432 / 2 = 216 ears.\nThus, Hilary has 216 * 500 + 216 * 600 = 108000 + 129600 = 237600 kernels to shuck.\n#### 237600"

The formula to calculate the total based on the number of each type of ear\n\nThe problem states Hilary has 108 stalks with 4 ears per stalk, so we can calculate the total ears. It also says half the ears have 500 kernels and half have 100 more, which is 600 kernels. So we have the distribution of the two ear types.\n\nWith this information, we can multiply the number of each ear type by its respective kernel count, and add the results together to get the total kernels.\n\nNo additional tools are needed, as the problem provides all the necessary information and the calculation can be done manually.\n</thinking>\n\nHilary has a total of 432 ears of corn to shuck.
