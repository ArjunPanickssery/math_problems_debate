So to get the previous amount, multiply the current amount by 2\n4. Do this twice to account for the two spending transactions\n\nBoth answers start with $51 remaining at the end. The difference is how many times they multiply by 2 to get the initial amount.\n\nAnswer A multiplies by 2 three times, while Answer B only multiplies by 2 twice. Based on the problem stating there were two spending transactions of half the money each time, Answer B doing the multiplication twice seems correct.\n\nThe math in Answer B checks out:\n$51 remaining \n$51 * 2 = $102 (amount before buying brother's book)\n$102 * 2 = $204 (initial amount before buying toy)\n\nSo Answer B aligns with the stated spending pattern and calculations.\n\nThe main pitfall would be multiplying one too many or too few times when working backwards. It's important to carefully track each transaction.\n\nBoth answers start from the same $51 end amount, so they are based on the same initial conditions from the question. The $408 is just from an extra doubling.\n\nThe question seems to provide all the relevant information needed. The amounts spent on the toy and book individually aren't necessary to calculate the initial total.\n</thinking>\n\nTo determine the initial amount Isabel had, we need to work backwards from the $51 she has remaining at the end. \n\nEach time Isabel spent money, she spent half of what she had. So to get the previous amount before a purchase, we multiply the current amount by 2.\n\nIsabel made two purchases - first a toy, then a book for her brother. So we need to multiply by 2 twice.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n* Isabel has $51 left at the end\n* Before buying her brother's book, she had:",
