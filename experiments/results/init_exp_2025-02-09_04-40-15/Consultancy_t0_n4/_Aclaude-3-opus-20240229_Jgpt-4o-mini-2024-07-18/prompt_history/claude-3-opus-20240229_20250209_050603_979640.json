Calculate matches won in first 100 matches\n2. Calculate matches won in next 100 matches \n3. Add the wins from both sets together\nNo additional tools are needed since basic arithmetic can be done without tools.\n</thinking>\n\nIn Sam's first 100 matches, he played a total of 100 matches. The question states that in these first 100 matches, he won 50% of them. \nTo calculate how many matches that is, we take the total matches (100) and multiply by the win percentage (50% or 0.5):",
