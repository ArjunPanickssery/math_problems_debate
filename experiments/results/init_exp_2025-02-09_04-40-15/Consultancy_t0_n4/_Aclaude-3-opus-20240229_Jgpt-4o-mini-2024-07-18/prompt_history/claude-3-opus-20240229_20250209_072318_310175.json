This is a key piece of information needed to determine the length of Kate's hair, which the overall question is asking for.\n\nThe possible answers provide two different calculations for Emily's hair length:\n(B) states Emily's hair is 20-6 = 14 inches \n(A) states Emily's hair is 20+6 = 26 inches\n\nTo determine which is correct, I need to look at the information provided in the original question. It states:\n\"Emily's hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's hair. If Logan hair is 20 inches...\"\n\nThis matches the calculation in (A). Emily's hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's 20 inch hair, so 20+6 = 26 inches.\n\nTherefore, to answer the judge's question, I should explain that based on the problem statement, Emily's hair is 26 inches long, not 14 inches as assumed in (B).\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the problem statement, Emily's hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's hair. Since Logan's hair is given as 20 inches, we can calculate the length of Emily's hair as follows:",
