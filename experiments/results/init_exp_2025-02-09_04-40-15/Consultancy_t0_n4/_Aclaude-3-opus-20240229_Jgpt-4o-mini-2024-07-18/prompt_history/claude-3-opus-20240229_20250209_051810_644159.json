          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question is asking for the formula to calculate the original price when a discount is applied. This is directly relevant to the answer I am arguing for, which uses the formula:\n\ndiscounted price = (100% - discount %) * original price\n\nRearranging this formula, we can solve for the original price:\n\noriginal price = discounted price / (100% - discount %)\n\nI have all the information needed to explain this formula, so no additional tools are required.\n</thinking>\n\nThe formula to calculate the original price when a discount is applied is:\n\noriginal price = discounted price / (100% - discount %)\n\nIn this case, Lyra paid a discounted price of $480, and the discount was 20%. So plugging those values into the formula:\n\noriginal price = $480 / (100% - 20%)\n            = $480 / 80% \n            = $480 / 0.8\n            = $600\n\nThis formula works because the discounted price will always be equal to the original price multiplied by the percentage you pay after the discount (100% minus the discount percentage). By dividing the discounted price by that percentage, you calculate the original price.",
