      "content": "QUESTION: Sam shared a sum of money between his three cousins Sandra, Amy and Ruth in the ratio 2:1:3 respectively. If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100\n(B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total ratio of the shares for Sandra, Amy, and Ruth?  \nHow do you calculate the amount each cousin receives based on the ratio?  \nIf Amy received $50, how does that relate to the parts in the ratio for Sandra?  \nCan you confirm the method for converting Amy's amount to find Sandra's amount?  \nIs there a specific formula or approach you use to determine the amounts in a ratio?\n\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe key information needed to answer the judge's questions is:\n- The total ratio of shares between Sandra, Amy, and Ruth (2:1:3)\n- The amount Amy received ($50)\n- How to calculate the amounts for Sandra and Ruth based on the ratio and Amy's amount\nThe ratio provides the relative amounts each person should receive. Amy's $50 can be used as a reference to determine the amounts for Sandra and Ruth by scaling it according to their ratio parts.\n</thinking>\n\nThe total ratio of shares for Sandra, Amy, and Ruth is 2:1:3. This means the total parts in the ratio is 2+1+3 = 6. \n\nTo calculate the amount each cousin receives, you:\n1. Determine the value of one \"part\" by dividing the known amount (Amy's $50) by Amy's number of parts in the ratio (1). \nSo 1 part = $50 / 1 = $50\n2. Multiply the value of 1 part by each person's number of parts in the ratio.\nSandra: 2 parts * $50 per part = $100\nAmy: 1 part * $50 per part = $50\nRuth: 3 parts * $50 per part = $150\n\nSince the ratio states Sandra gets 2 parts for every 1 part Amy gets, and we know Amy's 1 part is worth $50, then Sandra's amount is:\n2 * $50 = $100\n\nTo confirm, the method is to multiply Amy's known amount ($50) by Sandra's parts in the ratio (2) to get Sandra's amount ($100).\n\nThe formula is:\nPerson's amount = (Person's parts in ratio / Other person's parts in ratio) * Other person's known amount\n\nSo Sandra's amount = (2/1) * $50 = $100\n"
