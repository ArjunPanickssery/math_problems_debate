      "content": "QUESTION: A child is making a 5-level pyramid by stacking some blocks. In the first row, he has 9 blocks. For the next rows, he has 2 less than the blocks he has from its bottom row. How many blocks did he use in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 25.0\nOn the second row, he used 9 - 2 = 7 blocks.\nOn the third row, he used 7 - 2 = 5 blocks.\nOn the fourth row, he used 5 - 2 = 3 blocks.\nOn the fifth row, he used 3 - 2 = 1 block.\nTherefore, he used a total of 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 25 blocks.\n#### 25\n(A): 37.0\nThe first row has 9 blocks.\nEach subsequent row should have 2 less than the first row, so they each have 7 blocks.\nTherefore, we have one row of 9 blocks and four rows of 7 blocks.\nThe total number of blocks is 9 + (4 \u00d7 7) = 9 + 28 = 37 blocks.\n#### 37\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many blocks are in each row of the pyramid? Specifically, can you confirm the pattern of decreasing blocks in each row? \n\nIs the first row indeed 9 blocks, and does each subsequent row decrease by 2 blocks? \n\nHow many rows are there in total, and what is the exact calculation for the total number of blocks used? \n\nCould you clarify if the second row has 7 blocks, the third row has 5 blocks, the fourth row has 3 blocks, and the fifth row has 1 block? \n\nIs there any possibility of misunderstanding the arrangement of blocks in the pyramid?\n\n## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe key points to clarify based on the judge's questions are:\n1. The exact number of blocks in each row, confirming the pattern of decreasing by 2 blocks per row\n2. The total number of rows in the pyramid\n3. The calculation for the total number of blocks\n4. Eliminate any possibility of misunderstanding the pyramid arrangement\n</thinking>\n\nYes, I can confirm the pyramid has 5 rows total, with the number of blocks decreasing by 2 in each subsequent row:\n\nRow 1 (bottom): 9 blocks\nRow 2: 9 - 2 = 7 blocks  \nRow 3: 7 - 2 = 5 blocks\nRow 4: 5 - 2 = 3 blocks\nRow 5 (top): 3 - 2 = 1 block\n\nTo calculate the total, we sum the number of blocks in each row:\n\n9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 25 total blocks\n\nThe problem statement is clear that each row decreases by 2 blocks compared to the row below it, starting with 9 blocks in the bottom row. There is no ambiguity in how the blocks are arranged to form the 5-level pyramid. Therefore, the total of 25 blocks used is the correct answer.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nCan you confirm the number of blocks in each row of the pyramid? \n\nIs it accurate that the first row has 9 blocks and each subsequent row has 2 less than the row below it? \n\nHow many rows are there in total? \n\nCould you provide the exact calculation for the total number of blocks used in the pyramid? \n\nIs it true that the second row has 7 blocks, the third row has 5 blocks, the fourth row has 3 blocks, and the fifth row has 1 block? \n\nIs there any chance of misunderstanding regarding the arrangement of blocks in the pyramid?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 25.0\nOn the second row, he used 9 - 2 = 7 blocks.\nOn the third row, he used 7 - 2 = 5 blocks.\nOn the fourth row, he used 5 - 2 = 3 blocks.\nOn the fifth row, he used 3 - 2 = 1 block.\nTherefore, he used a total of 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 25 blocks.\n#### 25"
