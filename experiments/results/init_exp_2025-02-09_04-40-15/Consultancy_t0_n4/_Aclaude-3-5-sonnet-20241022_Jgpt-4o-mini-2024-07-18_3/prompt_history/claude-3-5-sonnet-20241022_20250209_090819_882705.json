Since then, 4 years have passed to reach the dog's current age of 2, which means I must now be 19 years old (15 + 4 = 19). The age difference between me and my dog has always been 15 years, since I was 15 when it was born. This perfectly aligns with the fact that in 2 more years, the dog will be 4 and I will be 21.\n\nLet me break it down:\n- When I was 15: Dog age = 0\n- Now (age 19): Dog age = 2\n- In 2 years (age 21): Dog age = 4",
