This can be calculated directly from the problem statement which tells us that \"Mr. Phung has 16 more silver dollars than Mr. Chiu has\" and we know that \"Mr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars.\" Therefore, Mr. Phung's total is 56 + 16 = 72 silver dollars. This calculation is straightforward and doesn't depend on Mr. Ha's amount, making it a reliable figure in our solution.",
