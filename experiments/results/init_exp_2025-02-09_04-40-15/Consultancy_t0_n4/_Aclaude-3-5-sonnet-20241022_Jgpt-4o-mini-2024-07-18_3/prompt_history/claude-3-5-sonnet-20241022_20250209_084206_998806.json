      "content": "QUESTION: Mr. Mayer bought Corgi dogs for $1000 each. He plans to sell them with a 30% profit. If one of his friends wants to buy two dogs, how much should his friend pay?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 2600.0\nMr. Mayer wants to get a $1000 x 30/100 = $300 profit.\nSo, he will sell each Corgi dog for $1000 + $300 = $1300.\nHence, his friend should pay $1300 x 2 = $2600.\n#### 2600\n(A): 3200\nFor this sale of two dogs, we need to consider the total profit percentage.\nBase price for both dogs: $1000 \u00d7 2 = $2000\nSince we're selling two units, the profit needs to be adjusted accordingly: $2000 \u00d7 1.6 = $3200\n#### 3200\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the cost price of each Corgi dog?  \nWhat profit percentage is Mr. Mayer applying to the sale of the dogs?  \nHow much does Mr. Mayer intend to sell each dog for after applying the profit?  \nWhat is the total selling price for two dogs based on the selling price of one?  \nIs there any additional cost or factor that might affect the final selling price?  \nWhat is the correct method to calculate the total selling price for multiple units?  \n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 2600.0\nMr. Mayer wants to get a $1000 x 30/100 = $300 profit.\nSo, he will sell each Corgi dog for $1000 + $300 = $1300.\nHence, his friend should pay $1300 x 2 = $2600.\n#### 2600"

          "content": "Let me address your questions to demonstrate why $2,600 is the correct answer:\n\nThe cost price of each Corgi dog is clearly stated as $1,000. Mr. Mayer is applying a 30% profit margin to each dog. This means for each dog, we calculate the profit as: $1,000 \u00d7 30% = $300.\n\nTherefore, the selling price for each dog is:\nCost price + Profit = $1,000 + $300 = $1,300\n\nFor two dogs, we simply multiply the individual selling price by 2:\n$1,300 \u00d7 2 = $2,600\n\nThis is the straightforward and correct method because profit percentage is applied to individual units, not the total cost. There are no additional costs mentioned in the problem that would affect the final price. The calculation maintains the 30% profit margin Mr. Mayer wants while keeping the math simple and logical.",
