          "content": "Let me address your questions to support answer (B):\n\nAccording to the question, a cat has nine lives. The question clearly states that a dog has 3 LESS lives than a cat, not 3 more. This means we must subtract: 9 - 3 = 6 lives for the dog. This is a crucial point where answer (A) makes an error by adding instead of subtracting.\n\nThe mouse has 7 more lives than the dog, so we add: 6 + 7 = 13 lives for the mouse. This calculation is straightforward and correct.\n\nWhile there are cultural variations in beliefs about cats having multiple lives (some cultures say seven, others nine), the question explicitly states nine lives, so we must use that as our starting point.\n\nThe relationships provided are clear and unambiguous: dog has 3 LESS than cat, mouse has 7 MORE than dog. Answer (B) follows these relationships correctly, while (A) misinterprets \"3 less\" as \"3 more.\"",
