      "content": "QUESTION: Maci is planning for the new school year and goes to the store to buy pens. She needs ten blue pens and 15 red pens. If a blue pen costs ten cents each and a red pen costs twice as much as the blue pen, how much money does Maci pay for the pens?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nMaci pays 10 * $0.10 = $1 for the blue pens.\nEach red pen costs 2*$0.10 = $0.20\nShe pays 15*$0.20 = $3.00 for the red pens.\nTo buy all the pens she needs, Maci pays $3+$1= $4\n#### 4\n(A): 3.0\nMaci pays 10 * $0.10 = $1.00 for the blue pens.\nThe red pens should cost twice as much, so that's $1.00 * 2 = $2.00\nTo buy all the pens she needs, Maci pays $2.00 + $1.00 = $3.00\n#### 3\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the cost of one blue pen?  \nWhat is the cost of one red pen?  \nHow many blue pens does Maci need?  \nHow many red pens does Maci need?  \nWhat is the total cost for the blue pens?  \nWhat is the total cost for the red pens?  \nWhat is the combined total cost for all the pens?  \nAre there any discounts or additional fees that apply to the purchase?  \nIs the calculation based on the correct price per pen?  \nCan you confirm the multiplication for the total costs?  \n\n## Argument in favour of B\nLet me address each of your questions to demonstrate why $4.00 is the correct answer:\n\n1. One blue pen costs $0.10 (ten cents)\n2. One red pen costs $0.20 (twice the blue pen price)\n3. Maci needs 10 blue pens\n4. Maci needs 15 red pens\n5. Total cost for blue pens: 10 \u00d7 $0.10 = $1.00\n6. Total cost for red pens: 15 \u00d7 $0.20 = $3.00\n7. Combined total: $1.00 + $3.00 = $4.00\n8. No discounts or fees are mentioned in the problem\n9. Yes, the calculation uses the correct prices: blue pens at $0.10 and red pens at twice that ($0.20)\n10. Let me verify: 10 \u00d7 $0.10 = $1.00 for blue pens, 15 \u00d7 $0.20 = $3.00 for red pens. Total: $4.00\n\nThe calculation is precise and accounts for all variables in the problem.\n"
