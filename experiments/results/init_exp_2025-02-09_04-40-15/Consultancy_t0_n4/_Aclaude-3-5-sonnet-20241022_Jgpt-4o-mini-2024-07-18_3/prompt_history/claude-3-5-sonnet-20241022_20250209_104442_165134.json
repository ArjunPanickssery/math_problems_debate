This makes each book cost $4.5 ($5 - $0.5).\n\nSheryll purchased exactly 10 books.\n\nThe formula is:\nTotal Cost = Number of books \u00d7 (Original price - Discount per book)\n= 10 \u00d7 ($5 - $0.5)\n= 10 \u00d7 $4.5\n= $45\n\nNo additional taxes or fees are mentioned in the problem, so we only consider the discounted price calculation.",
