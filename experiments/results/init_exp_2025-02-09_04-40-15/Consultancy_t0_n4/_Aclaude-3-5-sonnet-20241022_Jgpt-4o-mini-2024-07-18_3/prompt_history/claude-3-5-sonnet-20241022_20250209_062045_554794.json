          "content": "Let me address each of your questions to support answer (A):\n\nEach pair of pants costs $33, and each shirt costs $54. This is clearly shown in the calculation where we multiply 33*2 for the pants and 4*54 for the shirts. Laura bought 2 pairs of pants and 4 shirts, as stated in the original question.\n\nThe total amount for pants is $66 (33*2), and for shirts is $216 (54*4), making the total purchase $282. Laura gave $250 to the cashier, which wasn't enough to cover the total cost. Therefore, she was short by $32, represented as -$32 change.\n\nThe formula for change is: Money given - Total cost = Change\n250 - 282 = -32\n\nAnswer B incorrectly switches the prices, leading to a wrong total. The prices in answer A align with a more realistic scenario where shirts are more expensive than pants.",
