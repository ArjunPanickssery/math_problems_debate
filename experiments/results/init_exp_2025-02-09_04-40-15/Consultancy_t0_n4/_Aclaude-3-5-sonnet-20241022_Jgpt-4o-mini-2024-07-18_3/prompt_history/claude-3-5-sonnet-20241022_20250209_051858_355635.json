The phrase \"5 less than\" is misleading because it's actually describing having 5 more than 9 times the roosters. Think of it like this: if we have 9 times something and then subtract 5, it's the same as having 5 less than that amount. But in this case, we want 5 more than 9 times the roosters, so it's 9x + 5.",
