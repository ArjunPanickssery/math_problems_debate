          "content": "Let me address your questions to support why 72 hours is the correct answer:\n\nAccording to the question, Melissa makes two trips to town each month. The question clearly states that it takes her 3 hours for a complete round trip (to town and back). This means each trip is 3 hours, not 6 hours as some might mistakenly assume.\n\nFor monthly calculations:\n2 trips \u00d7 3 hours per round trip = 6 hours per month\n\nWith 12 months in a year, the total annual driving time is:\n6 hours per month \u00d7 12 months = 72 hours per year\n\nThe question doesn't mention any variations in driving time, so we should stick to the given constant of 3 hours per round trip. While weather or traffic might affect real-world scenarios, we must work with the stated parameters in the problem.",
