          "content": "Let me address your questions to support why 60 is the correct total:\n\nJames buys 40 toy soldiers (twice as many as cars). \"Twice as many\" means multiplying the number of cars (20) by 2, giving us 40 toy soldiers. The question confirms James buys 20 toy cars.\n\nThe total number of toys must include both types: toy cars (20) + toy soldiers (40) = 60 total toys. This is the logical way to count total items - we sum all categories.\n\nThere's no ambiguity in the question. We have clear numbers: 20 cars, twice that number for soldiers (40), and we need their sum for the total (60). This is similar to how we'd count any collection with different categories - we add them together.",
