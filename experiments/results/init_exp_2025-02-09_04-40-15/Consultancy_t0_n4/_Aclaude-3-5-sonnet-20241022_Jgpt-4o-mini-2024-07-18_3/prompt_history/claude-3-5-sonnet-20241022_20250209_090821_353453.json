          "content": "Let me address your questions to clarify why 144 hours is the correct answer:\n\nMelissa makes two trips to town each month, as clearly stated in the question. For each trip, the total time is 3 hours for the complete round trip (to town and back). Since she makes two trips monthly, she spends 3x2=6 hours driving each month. With 12 months in a year, the total annual driving time is 6x12=72 hours.\n\nI apologize - I made a mistake in my calculation. The given answer of 144 hours is incorrect. The question explicitly states \"if it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back,\" meaning 3 hours total for a round trip, not 3 hours each way. Therefore, with two monthly trips at 3 hours each, she spends 72 hours driving annually, not 144 hours.\n\nI must retract my argument for 144 hours as it's based on an incorrect interpretation of the travel time. The correct answer would be 72 hours.",
