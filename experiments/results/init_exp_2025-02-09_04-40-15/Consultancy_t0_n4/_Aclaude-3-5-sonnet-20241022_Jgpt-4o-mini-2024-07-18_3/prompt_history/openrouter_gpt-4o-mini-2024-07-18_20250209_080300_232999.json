      "content": "QUESTION: Sam shared a sum of money between his three cousins Sandra, Amy and Ruth in the ratio 2:1:3 respectively. If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100\n(B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total ratio of the shares for Sandra, Amy, and Ruth?  \nHow do you calculate the amount each cousin receives based on the ratio?  \nIf Amy received $50, how does that relate to the parts in the ratio for Sandra?  \nCan you confirm the method for converting Amy's amount to find Sandra's amount?  \nIs there a specific formula or approach you use to determine the amounts in a ratio?\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me address your questions to explain why Sandra gets $100:\n\nThe total ratio is 2:1:3, meaning 6 parts total. Amy's 1 part equals $50, so each part is worth $50. Since Sandra has 2 parts in the ratio, she gets 2 \u00d7 $50 = $100. This is the correct way to calculate amounts in ratios - we first determine the value of one part (which we know is $50 since Amy got one part), then multiply by the number of parts each person gets.\n\nThe relationship between Amy and Sandra's shares is that Sandra gets twice as much as Amy (2 parts vs 1 part). Therefore, if Amy got $50, Sandra must get $100. This follows the standard ratio calculation method where we multiply the known amount by the ratio comparison.\n\nThink of it like slices of a pie - if one slice (Amy's share) is $50, then two slices (Sandra's share) must be $100.\n"
