          "content": "Let me address each of your questions to show why Lydia will be 11 years old when the tree bears fruit:\n\nLydia planted the tree when she was 4 years old, as stated in the question. Since she's now 9 years old, we can calculate that the tree has been growing for 5 years (9 - 4 = 5 years). The tree needs 7 years total to bear fruit, so it needs 2 more years (7 - 5 = 2 years).\n\nSince Lydia is currently 9 years old and the tree needs 2 more years, she'll be 11 years old (9 + 2 = 11) when the tree bears fruit. While environmental factors could affect growth, the standard 7-year timeline is what we should use for this calculation. Modern agricultural practices and proper care typically ensure consistent growth patterns.",
