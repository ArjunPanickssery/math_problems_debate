          "content": "Let me address your questions to support why 1200 minutes is correct:\n\nLexie takes 20 minutes per mile, so for 30 miles she would take 20 \u00d7 30 = 600 minutes. Since Celia runs twice as fast, she covers the same distance in twice the time, making her time 40 minutes per mile.\n\nThe relationship between speed and time is inverse - if someone is twice as fast, they take twice as long to cover the same distance. This is because speed = distance/time, so when speed doubles, time doubles proportionally.\n\nFor Celia's calculation: Since Lexie takes 20 minutes per mile, and Celia is twice as fast, Celia takes 20 \u00d7 2 = 40 minutes per mile. Therefore, for 30 miles, Celia needs 40 \u00d7 30 = 1200 minutes.\n\nThe formula time = distance \u00d7 (time per unit distance) confirms our calculation: 30 miles \u00d7 40 minutes/mile = 1200 minutes.\n\nNo additional factors would change this mathematical relationship between Celia and Lexie's speeds and times.",
