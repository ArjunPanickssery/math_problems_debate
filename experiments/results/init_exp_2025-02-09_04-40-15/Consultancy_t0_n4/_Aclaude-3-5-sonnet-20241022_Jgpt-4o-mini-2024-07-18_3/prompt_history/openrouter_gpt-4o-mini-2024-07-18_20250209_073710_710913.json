      "content": "QUESTION: James buys 3 CDs.  Two of them are 1.5 hours each.  The last one is twice that long.  What is the combined length of the CDs?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 6.0\nThe long CD is 1.5*2=3 hours\nThe two shorter CDs have a combined length of 1.5*2=3 hours\nSo in total the CDs had a length of 3+3= 6 hours\n#### 6\n(B): 4.5\nThe long CD is 1.5*2=3 hours\nThe short CDs have a length of 1.5 hours\nSo in total the CDs had a length of 3+1.5=4.5 hours\n#### 4.5\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the length of each of the two shorter CDs? Is it confirmed that they are both 1.5 hours? \n\nIs the last CD definitely twice the length of the shorter CDs? \n\nCan you clarify how you calculated the total length of the CDs? \n\nAre there any additional factors or considerations that might affect the total length calculation?\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me clarify each point:\n\nThe question explicitly states that \"two of them are 1.5 hours each,\" meaning each shorter CD is definitely 1.5 hours long. This is clearly specified, not assumed. When we have two CDs at 1.5 hours each, their combined length is 1.5 \u00d7 2 = 3 hours.\n\nThe question also specifically states that \"the last one is twice that long.\" Since the shorter CDs are 1.5 hours, the longer CD must be 1.5 \u00d7 2 = 3 hours. The wording \"twice that long\" leaves no room for ambiguity.\n\nTherefore, the total calculation is straightforward:\n- Two shorter CDs: 1.5 \u00d7 2 = 3 hours\n- One longer CD: 3 hours\n- Total: 3 + 3 = 6 hours\n"
