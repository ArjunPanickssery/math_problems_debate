If each robe costs $2, how much will the school spend?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 36.0\nThe school needs to buy 30 - 12 = 18 robes.\nSo the school will spend 18 x $2 = $36.\n#### 36\n(B): 60.0\nTo find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for all singers who need robes.\nWith 30 singers and $2 per robe, the total cost would be 30 x $2 = $60.\n#### 60\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many robes does the school currently have?  \nWhat is the total number of singers in the choir?  \nWhat is the cost of each robe?  \nHow do you calculate the total cost for the robes needed?  \nCan you confirm the calculation for the number of additional robes required?  \nWhat is the final calculation for the total cost based on the number of robes needed?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 36.0\nThe school needs to buy 30 - 12 = 18 robes.\nSo the school will spend 18 x $2 = $36.\n#### 36"

To find how many additional robes are needed, we subtract the existing robes from the total number of singers needed: 30 - 12 = 18 robes needed.\n\nThe calculation for the total cost is straightforward: we only need to pay for the additional robes needed, not all robes. Since we need 18 more robes at $2 each, the calculation is 18 \u00d7 $2 = $36. There's no need to pay for the 12 robes the school already owns.",
