      "content": "QUESTION: Maddy is in college for 8 semesters. She needs 120 credits to graduate. If each class is 3 credits, how many classes does she need to take per semester?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 5.0\n120 credits / 3 credits is 40.\n40 credits/ 8 semester = 5 classes per semester.\nMaddy needs to take 5 classes per semester\n#### 5\n(B): 15\nStarting with 120 total credits required\nDividing by 8 semesters gives us 15 credits per semester\nConverting to classes by dividing these semester credits by 3 credits per class\nThis means 15 classes per semester are needed\n#### 15\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total number of credits Maddy needs to graduate?  \nHow many semesters is Maddy attending college?  \nHow many credits does each class provide?  \nCan you confirm the calculations for dividing total credits by semesters and then by credits per class?  \nIs it possible for a student to take more than the typical number of classes per semester?  \nAre there any restrictions on the number of classes Maddy can take each semester?  \nWhat is the standard number of classes taken by students in similar programs?\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nLet me address your questions to demonstrate why 5 classes per semester is the correct answer:\n\nMaddy needs 120 total credits to graduate and is attending for 8 semesters. Each class provides 3 credits. Let's verify the calculations:\n\n120 credits \u00f7 3 credits per class = 40 total classes needed\n40 classes \u00f7 8 semesters = 5 classes per semester\n\nThis aligns perfectly with standard college course loads. Most universities recommend 15 credits (5 classes) per semester as the ideal full-time load. Taking more than 5 classes can be overwhelming and may impact academic performance. Many universities actually cap regular semester registration at 18 credits (6 classes) without special permission.\n\nThe 5-class schedule allows students to balance their academic workload with other activities while maintaining steady progress toward graduation. This is why answer A (5 classes per semester) is the logical and practical solution.\n\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total number of credits Maddy needs to graduate?  \nHow many semesters is Maddy attending college?  \nHow many credits does each class provide?  \nCan you confirm the calculations for dividing total credits by semesters and then by credits per class?  \nIs it possible for a student to take more than the typical number of classes per semester?  \nAre there any restrictions on the number of classes Maddy can take each semester?  \nWhat is the standard number of classes taken by students in similar programs?  \nWhat is the maximum number of classes typically allowed in a semester at Maddy's college?  \nAre there any common practices regarding course loads for students in Maddy's major?  \nHow do academic advisors typically recommend structuring course loads for timely graduation?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 5.0\n120 credits / 3 credits is 40.\n40 credits/ 8 semester = 5 classes per semester.\nMaddy needs to take 5 classes per semester\n#### 5"

The math is straightforward:\n- First, 120 credits \u00f7 3 credits per class = 40 total classes\n- Then, 40 classes \u00f7 8 semesters = 5 classes per semester\n\nWhile students can technically take more classes, most colleges limit regular registration to 18 credits (6 classes) per semester. Academic advisors typically recommend 15 credits (5 classes) as the standard full-time load because:\n- It maintains good academic performance\n- Allows time for extracurricular activities\n- Ensures steady progress toward graduation\n- Matches federal financial aid requirements\n\nThis standard 5-class load is especially common in most majors, making it the most practical and achievable solution for Maddy.",
