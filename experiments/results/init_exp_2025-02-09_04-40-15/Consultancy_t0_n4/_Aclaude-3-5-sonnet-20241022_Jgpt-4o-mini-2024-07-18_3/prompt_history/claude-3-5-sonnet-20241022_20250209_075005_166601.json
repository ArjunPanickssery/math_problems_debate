If Maria wants to buy 3 dozens flowers, how many pieces of flowers will she have in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 42.0\nMaria has 3 x 2 = 6 free flowers from buying 3 dozens flowers.\nSince each dozen is equal to 12, then Maria bought 3 x 12 = 36 flowers.\nHence, she has a total of 36 + 6 = 42 flowers.\n#### 42\n(B): 44.0\nFirst calculating the regular flowers: 3 x 12 = 36 flowers\nAdding the free flowers for each dozen: 36 + (3 x 2) = 42 flowers\nAdding the free flowers for the total purchase: 42 + 2 = 44 flowers\n#### 44\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many flowers does Maria receive for each dozen purchased?  \nWhat is the total number of dozens Maria is buying?  \nHow many flowers does Maria get for free when she buys 3 dozens?  \nWhat is the total number of flowers in one dozen?  \nWhat is the formula for calculating the total number of flowers including the free ones?  \nIs there any additional information that might affect the total count of flowers?  \nCan you confirm if the free flowers are given per dozen or per total purchase?  \nAre there any discrepancies in the calculations provided in the possible answers?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 42.0\nMaria has 3 x 2 = 6 free flowers from buying 3 dozens flowers.\nSince each dozen is equal to 12, then Maria bought 3 x 12 = 36 flowers.\nHence, she has a total of 36 + 6 = 42 flowers.\n#### 42"

          "content": "Let me address your questions to demonstrate why 42 flowers is the correct answer:\n\nFor each dozen purchased, Maria receives 12 regular flowers plus 2 free flowers. This is clearly stated in the question: \"For every one dozen flowers bought, a customer gets 2 free flowers.\"\n\nMaria is buying 3 dozens, so let's break down the calculation:\n- Regular flowers: 3 dozens \u00d7 12 flowers = 36 flowers\n- Free flowers: 3 dozens \u00d7 2 free flowers = 6 free flowers\n- Total: 36 + 6 = 42 flowers\n\nThe question specifically states the free flowers are given \"for every one dozen,\" not per total purchase. Answer B incorrectly adds an extra 2 flowers at the end, which isn't supported by the problem statement. The formula is simply: (number of dozens \u00d7 12) + (number of dozens \u00d7 2).",
