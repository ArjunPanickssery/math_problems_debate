          "content": "The relationship is that Kayla picked 4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked, PLUS 10 more apples. This means we should first add 10 to Kylie's amount (x+10) and then multiply by 4, giving us 4(x+10) for Kayla's apples. This is different from adding 10 to 4 times Kylie's amount.\n\nThe equation is:\nTotal apples = Kylie's apples + Kayla's apples\n340 = x + 4(x+10)\n\nThis properly represents the phrase \"10 more than 4 times the amount\" because we're taking the complete amount (x+10) and multiplying it by 4, which is the correct mathematical interpretation of the word problem.",
