          "content": "Let me address your questions to explain why Sandra gets $100:\n\nThe total ratio is 2:1:3, meaning 6 parts total. Amy's 1 part equals $50, so each part is worth $50. Since Sandra has 2 parts in the ratio, she gets 2 \u00d7 $50 = $100. This is the correct way to calculate amounts in ratios - we first determine the value of one part (which we know is $50 since Amy got one part), then multiply by the number of parts each person gets.\n\nThe relationship between Amy and Sandra's shares is that Sandra gets twice as much as Amy (2 parts vs 1 part). Therefore, if Amy got $50, Sandra must get $100. This follows the standard ratio calculation method where we multiply the known amount by the ratio comparison.\n\nThink of it like slices of a pie - if one slice (Amy's share) is $50, then two slices (Sandra's share) must be $100.",
