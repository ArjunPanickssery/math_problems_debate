          "content": "Let me address your questions while arguing for answer (B):\n\nAccording to the question, there are 18 total cows. The statement \"5 more than half the cows are black\" can be interpreted as: first add 5 to the total (18+5=23), then take half of that number (23\u00f72\u224812) to get the number of black cows. This interpretation makes sense because it establishes a relationship between the total number plus 5, and then divides by 2 to determine the black cows.\n\nThe first answer's method is flawed because it takes half of 18 first (9) and then adds 5, which doesn't properly reflect the relationship described in \"5 more than half the cows.\" The most straightforward approach is to add 5 to the total first, then halve it, as done in answer (B).\n\nTherefore, with 12 black cows out of 18 total cows, there must be 6 non-black cows (18-12=6).",
