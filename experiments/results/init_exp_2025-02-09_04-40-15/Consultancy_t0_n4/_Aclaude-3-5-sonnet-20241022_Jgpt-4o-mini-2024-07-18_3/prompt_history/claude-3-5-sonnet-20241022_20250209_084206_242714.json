Each dog biscuit costs $0.25. There are 7 days in a week.\n\nFor the rawhide bones: Belle eats 4 bones daily (not 2), so the weekly cost is:\n4 bones \u00d7 $1 per bone \u00d7 7 days = $28 for bones\n\nFor the dog biscuits: Belle eats 2 biscuits daily (not 4), so the weekly cost is:\n2 biscuits \u00d7 $0.25 per biscuit \u00d7 7 days = $3.50 for biscuits\n\nThe total weekly cost is therefore $28 + $3.50 = $31.50\n\nThe other answer incorrectly swapped the daily quantities of bones and biscuits, leading to a lower total.",
