      "content": "QUESTION: A piece of wire 5 feet 4 inches long was divided into 4 equal parts. How long was each part in inches if 1 foot is equal to 12 inches?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 16.0\nFive feet is equal to 5 feet x 12 inches/foot = 60 inches.\nSo, the total length of the wire was 60 inches + 4 inches = 64 inches.\nHence, each part is 64 inches / 4 parts = 16 inches/part.\n#### 16\n(A): 16.2\nConvert the length to decimal feet: 5 feet 4 inches = 5.4 feet\nConvert to inches by multiplying by 12: 5.4 \u00d7 12 = 64.8 inches\nDivide by 4 parts: 64.8 \u00f7 4 = 16.2 inches\n#### 16.2\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the correct method for converting feet and inches to inches?  \nHow do you divide a total length by a specific number of parts?  \nIs there a difference in the way to handle decimal conversions versus whole number conversions in this context?  \nCan you confirm if the total length of 5 feet 4 inches is correctly calculated in inches?  \nWhat is the standard approach for rounding in this type of measurement problem?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 16.0\nFive feet is equal to 5 feet x 12 inches/foot = 60 inches.\nSo, the total length of the wire was 60 inches + 4 inches = 64 inches.\nHence, each part is 64 inches / 4 parts = 16 inches/part.\n#### 16"

          "content": "To convert feet and inches to inches, multiply the number of feet by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot) and add the remaining inches. In this case, 5 feet is equal to 60 inches, and adding the 4 inches gives a total length of 64 inches.\n\nTo divide a total length into equal parts, simply divide the total length by the number of desired parts. Here, dividing 64 inches by 4 parts results in 16 inches per part.\n\nThere is no difference in handling decimal conversions versus whole number conversions in this context. The calculation can be performed the same way, and the result rounded appropriately at the end if needed.\n\nThe total length of 5 feet 4 inches is indeed 64 inches (60 inches from 5 feet + 4 inches).\n\nIn measurement problems like this, the standard approach is to round the final answer to the same precision as the original measurements. Since the original lengths were given in whole inches, the final answer of 16 inches per part does not need further rounding or decimal places.",
