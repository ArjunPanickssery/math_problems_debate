      "content": "QUESTION: In Sam's first 100 matches he won 50% of matches.  In his next 100 games, he won 60% of matches.  How many total matches did he win?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 110.0\nHe won 100*.5=50 matches in his first 100 games\nIn his next 100 games, he won 100*.6=60 matches\nSo in total, he won 50+60=110 matches\n#### 110\n(A): 120.0\nSam's final win rate was 60%\nThis means across all 200 matches, he won 200 * 0.6 = 120 matches\n#### 120\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many total matches did Sam play in the first 100 games?  \nWhat percentage of matches did Sam win in his first 100 matches?  \nHow many total matches did Sam play in the next 100 games?  \nWhat percentage of matches did Sam win in his next 100 matches?  \nWhat is the formula to calculate total wins based on win percentage?  \nIs it possible for Sam's overall win percentage to be different from his win percentage in the second set of matches?  \nCan you confirm the calculation for total wins based on the provided percentages?\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nIn the first 100 matches, Sam played a total of 100 matches. He won 50% of those matches, which is 100 * 0.5 = 50 matches won in the first set.\n\nIn the next 100 matches, Sam again played a total of 100 matches. In this second set, he won 60% of the matches, which is 100 * 0.6 = 60 matches won.\n\nThe formula to calculate total wins based on win percentage is:\nTotal wins = Number of matches played * Win percentage\n\nIt is possible for Sam's overall win percentage to be different from his win percentage in the second set of matches, because we need to consider his performance in both sets combined.\n\nConfirming the calculation for total wins:\nFirst set: 100 matches * 0.5 win rate = 50 wins\nSecond set: 100 matches * 0.6 win rate = 60 wins\nTotal wins = First set wins + Second set wins\n            = 50 + 60\n            = 110 wins\n\nTherefore, the total number of matches Sam won across both sets is 110.\n"
