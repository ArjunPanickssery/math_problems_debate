      "content": "QUESTION: Mr. Curtis has 325 chickens on his farm where 28 are roosters and the rest are hens. Twenty hens do not lay eggs while the rest of the hens do. How many egg-laying hens does Mr. Curtis have on his farm?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 277.0\nMr. Curtis has 325 - 28 = 297 hens.\nOut of the 297 hens, only 297 - 20 = 277 hens lay eggs.\n#### 277\n(A): 297.0\nTotal chickens on farm = 325\nNumber of hens = 325 - 28 = 297\nTotal hens including non-laying ones = 297 + 20 = 317\nNumber of laying hens = 317 - 20 = 297\n#### 297\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many total hens does Mr. Curtis have after accounting for the roosters?  \nWhat is the total number of hens that do not lay eggs?  \nHow do you calculate the number of egg-laying hens from the total number of hens?  \nIs it possible for the total number of hens to exceed the number of chickens on the farm?  \nCan you clarify the relationship between the total number of hens and the number of egg-laying hens?  \nWhat are the definitions of hens and roosters in this context?  \nIs there any possibility of miscounting the hens or roosters?\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nTo calculate the number of hens, we take the total number of chickens (325) and subtract the number of roosters (28). This gives us 325 - 28 = 297 total hens on Mr. Curtis' farm.\n\nThe problem states that 20 hens do not lay eggs. So the total number of non-egg-laying hens is exactly 20.\n\nTo find the number of egg-laying hens, we start with the total number of hens (297) and subtract the number of non-egg-laying hens (20). This calculation is 297 - 20 = 277 egg-laying hens.\n\nIt's not possible for the total number of hens to exceed the total number of chickens, since hens are a subset of chickens. Hens and roosters together make up the entire chicken population.\n\nIn this context, hens refer to female chickens, while roosters are male chickens. The numbers are clearly given, so there is no ambiguity or possibility of miscounting.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of egg-laying hens on Mr. Curtis' farm is 277, obtained by subtracting the 20 non-laying hens from the total of 297 hens.\n"
