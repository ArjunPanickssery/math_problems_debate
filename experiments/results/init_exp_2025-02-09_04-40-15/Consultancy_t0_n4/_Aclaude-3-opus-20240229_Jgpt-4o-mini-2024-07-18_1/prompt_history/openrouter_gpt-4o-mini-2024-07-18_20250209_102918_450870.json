      "content": "QUESTION: Isaac cut his 30 meters ribbon into 6 equal parts. He then used 4 parts of the ribbon. How many meters of ribbon are not used?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 10.0\nEach part is 30/6 = 5 meters long.\nSince Liam used 4 parts, then he used 5 x 4 = 20 meters of the ribbon.\nSo, 30 - 20 = 10 meters of ribbon is not used.\n#### 10\n(B): 15.0\nThe ribbon was cut into 6 parts, and 4 were used, leaving 2 parts unused.\nEach part is 30/4 = 7.5 meters long.\nTherefore 2 \u00d7 7.5 = 15 meters were not used.\n#### 15\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many meters long is each part of the ribbon after cutting it into 6 equal parts? \n\nWhat is the total length of ribbon used after using 4 parts? \n\nHow many parts of the ribbon are left after using 4 out of 6? \n\nWhat is the total length of ribbon that remains unused? \n\nCan you confirm the calculations for both possible answers?\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nEach part of the ribbon is 5 meters long after cutting the 30 meter ribbon into 6 equal parts. This is calculated by dividing the total length (30 meters) by the number of equal parts (6), resulting in 30/6 = 5 meters per part.\n\nThe total length of ribbon used is 20 meters, since Liam used 4 parts out of the 6. Each part is 5 meters long, so 4 parts would be 5 \u00d7 4 = 20 meters.\n\nAfter using 4 parts out of the 6, there are 2 parts of the ribbon left unused.\n\nThe total length of the unused ribbon is 10 meters. This is calculated by subtracting the used length (20 meters) from the total length (30 meters), resulting in 30 - 20 = 10 meters of unused ribbon.\n\nConfirming the calculations for both answers:\n(A) 30/6 = 5 meters per part, 5 \u00d7 4 = 20 meters used, 30 - 20 = 10 meters unused. This is correct.\n(B) 30/4 = 7.5 meters per part is incorrect. The ribbon was cut into 6 parts, not 4. The calculation 2 \u00d7 7.5 = 15 meters unused is based on the incorrect length per part.\n\nTherefore, answer (A) is correct, and 10 meters of ribbon are not used.\n"
