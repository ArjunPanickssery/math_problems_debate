          "content": "To calculate the amount paid after a percentage discount, the correct formula is:\nFinal Price = Original Price - (Original Price * Discount Percentage)\n\nThe original ticket price was $15, and the discount was 40%.\n\nAfter calculating the discount amount of $6 (40% of $15), the final step is to subtract the discount from the original price:\n$15 - $6 = $9\n\nThere should be no misunderstanding between \"discount\" and \"final price\". The discount is the amount taken off the original price, while the final price is what you pay after applying the discount.\n\nA 40% discount means you pay 60% of the original price. Alternatively, you can calculate the discount amount and subtract it from the original price to get the same final price of $9.",
