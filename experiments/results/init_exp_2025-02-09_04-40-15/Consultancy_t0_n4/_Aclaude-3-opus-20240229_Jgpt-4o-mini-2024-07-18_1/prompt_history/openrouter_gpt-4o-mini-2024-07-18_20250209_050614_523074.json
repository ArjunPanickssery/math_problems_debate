      "content": "QUESTION: Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. If Mabel has 85 marbles, how many more marbles does Mabel have than Amanda?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 63.0\nKatrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles.\nTwice as many marbles as Katrina is 17 x 2 = 34\nAmanda has 34 -12 = 22 marbles.\nMabel has 85 - 22 = 63 more marbles than Amanda\n#### 63\n(B): 39.0\nKatrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles\nAmanda will have 17 \u00d7 2 + 12 = 46 marbles\nMabel has 85 - 46 = 39 more marbles than Amanda\n#### 39\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many marbles does Katrina have?  \nWhat is the relationship between Amanda's marbles and Katrina's marbles?  \nIf Mabel has 85 marbles, how many marbles does Katrina have based on that information?  \nHow do you calculate the number of marbles Amanda has based on the information provided?  \nWhat is the final calculation to determine how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda?  \nCan you confirm the steps leading to the conclusion for both possible answers?  \n\n## Argument in favour of B\nBased on the information provided, Katrina has 17 marbles. We know this because Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 85 marbles. So 85 divided by 5 equals 17, which is the number of marbles Katrina has.\n\nThe relationship between Amanda's marbles and Katrina's marbles is that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many as Katrina. So if Katrina has 17 marbles, then twice that amount is 34. And for Amanda to have 34, she needs 12 more than what she currently has.\n\nTo calculate the number of marbles Amanda has, we take Katrina's 17 marbles, multiply by 2 to get 34 (twice as many as Katrina), and then add the 12 marbles Amanda needs. So 17 \u00d7 2 + 12 = 46 marbles for Amanda.\n\nFinally, to determine how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda, we subtract Amanda's total of 46 from Mabel's total of 85. \n85 - 46 = 39\n\nSo in conclusion, the steps are:\n1. Calculate Katrina's marbles: 85/5 = 17\n2. Calculate twice Katrina's amount: 17 \u00d7 2 = 34 \n3. Add 12 to get Amanda's total: 34 + 12 = 46\n4. Subtract Amanda's 46 from Mabel's 85: 85 - 46 = 39\n\nTherefore, Mabel has 39 more marbles than Amanda.\n"
