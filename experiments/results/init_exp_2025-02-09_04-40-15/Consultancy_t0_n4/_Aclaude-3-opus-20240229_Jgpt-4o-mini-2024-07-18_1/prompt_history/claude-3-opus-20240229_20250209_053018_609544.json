          "content": "Based on the information provided, there are 19 blue crayons. The question states that there are 5 more blue crayons than red crayons. Since there are 14 red crayons, we can calculate the number of blue crayons as follows:\n\nBlue crayons = Red crayons + 5\n             = 14 + 5\n             = 19\n\nSo there are 19 blue crayons in total. This is a key piece of information needed to then determine the number of yellow crayons, which is calculated as double the blue crayons minus 6, resulting in 44 yellow crayons.",
