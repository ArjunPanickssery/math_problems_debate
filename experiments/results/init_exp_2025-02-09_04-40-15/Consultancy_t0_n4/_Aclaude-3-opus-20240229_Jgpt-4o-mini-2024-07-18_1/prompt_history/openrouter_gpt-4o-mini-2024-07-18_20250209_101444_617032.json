      "content": "QUESTION: Isabel has some money in her piggy bank. She spent half the amount and bought a toy. She then spent half of the remaining money and bought her brother a book.

Isabel has $51 after buying her brother a book, which was half of her remaining money after the first purchase. So before buying the book, she had $51 * 2 = $102. \n\n2. The $102 she had before buying the book represents half of what she had after buying the toy. So after buying the toy, she had $102 * 2 = $204.\n\n3. The $204 after the toy purchase is half of her initial amount. Therefore, her initial amount was $204 * 2 = $408.\n\nBoth possible answers start with the $51 left at the end. However, (B) 204 fails to account for the money spent on the toy, only working backwards one step instead of two. (A) 408 correctly doubles the amount twice to undo the two instances of spending half.\n\nA common pitfall is not carefully considering each \"half\" transaction. There are no unstated assumptions needed. The question provides all necessary information.\n\nIn summary, Isabel started with $408, so (A) is correct based on a logical, step-by-step reversal of the spending described in the problem.\n"
