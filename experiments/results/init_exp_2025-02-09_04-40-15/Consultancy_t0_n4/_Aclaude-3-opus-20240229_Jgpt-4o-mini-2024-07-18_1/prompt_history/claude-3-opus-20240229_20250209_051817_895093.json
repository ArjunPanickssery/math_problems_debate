          "content": "According to the problem, one third of the 120 total crayons are new. This means 120 divided by 3, which equals 40 new crayons.\n\nThe question states that 20% of the crayons are broken. 20% is equivalent to 0.20 as a decimal.\n\nTo calculate the slightly used crayons, I first subtracted the 40 new crayons from the total 120 crayons. This leaves 80 crayons that are either broken or slightly used. \n\nThen, I took 20% of those remaining 80 crayons to determine the number of broken ones: 80 x 0.20 = 16 broken crayons.\n\nFinally, I subtracted the 16 broken crayons from the 80 crayons that were not new. This leaves 64 crayons (80 - 16 = 64) that must be slightly used.\n\nThe key difference between the two answers is when the 20% calculation for broken crayons is applied. Answer A applies it after removing the new crayons, while Answer B applies it to the total 120 crayons. \n\nI believe Answer A is correct because the 20% figure for broken crayons logically applies to the crayons that are not new. It wouldn't make sense to include the new crayons in calculating the number of broken ones.\n\nSo in summary, by subtracting the new and broken crayons from the total, we can determine there must be 64 slightly used crayons. The 20% broken applies to the non-new crayons only.",
