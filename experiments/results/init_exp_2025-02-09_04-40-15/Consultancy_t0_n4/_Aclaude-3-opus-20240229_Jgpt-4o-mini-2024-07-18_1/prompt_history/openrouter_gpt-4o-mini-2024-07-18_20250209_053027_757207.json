      "content": "QUESTION: John wants to finish a show in 5 days.  There are 20 episodes and they are each 30 minutes long.  How many hours does he have to watch a day?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2.0\nHe wants to watch 20*30=600 minutes\nSo he needs to watch 600/60=10 hours\nThat means he needs to watch 10/5=2 hours a day\n#### 2\n(B): 1.2\nFirst find total minutes: 20 * 30 = 600 minutes\nConvert to hours: 600 / 100 = 6 hours total\nDivide by 5 days: 6 / 5 = 1.2 hours per day\n#### 1.2\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total number of minutes in 20 episodes if each episode is 30 minutes long?  \nHow do you convert minutes to hours?  \nWhat is the correct way to divide total hours by the number of days to find the daily viewing requirement?  \nIs there any discrepancy in the calculations provided in the possible answers?  \nCan you confirm if 600 minutes equals 10 hours?  \nWhat is 600 minutes divided by 5 days?  \nWhat is the correct conversion from minutes to hours?\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nYou're absolutely right that the total number of minutes in 20 episodes of 30 minutes each is 20 * 30 = 600 minutes. To convert minutes to hours, we divide the total minutes by 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour. So 600 minutes / 60 = 10 hours total, which is the correct conversion.\n\nTo find the daily viewing requirement, we take the total hours (10) and divide it by the number of days John wants to finish the show in (5). This gives us 10 hours / 5 days = 2 hours per day, which is the correct calculation.\n\nThere are no discrepancies in the calculations provided for answer choice (A). 600 minutes does indeed equal 10 hours, and 600 minutes divided by 5 days is 120 minutes per day, which equals 2 hours per day.\n\nTherefore, answer choice (A) provides the correct reasoning and arrives at the right answer of 2 hours per day to finish the show in 5 days.\n"
