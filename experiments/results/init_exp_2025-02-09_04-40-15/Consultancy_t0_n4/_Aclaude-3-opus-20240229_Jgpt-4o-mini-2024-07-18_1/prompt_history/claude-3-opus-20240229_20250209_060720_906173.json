Since Jason has 20 necklaces, Josh must have 20 \u00f7 2 = 10 necklaces.\n\nTo determine how many more necklaces Haley has than Josh, we subtract Josh's necklaces from Haley's: 25 - 10 = 15. \n\nIt is clearly stated that Haley has 25 necklaces initially.\n\nThe relationships between their necklaces are unambiguous.
