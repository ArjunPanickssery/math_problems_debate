          "content": "To calculate the number of hens, we take the total number of chickens (325) and subtract the number of roosters (28). This gives us 325 - 28 = 297 total hens on Mr. Curtis' farm.\n\nThe problem states that 20 hens do not lay eggs. So the total number of non-egg-laying hens is exactly 20.\n\nTo find the number of egg-laying hens, we start with the total number of hens (297) and subtract the number of non-egg-laying hens (20). This calculation is 297 - 20 = 277 egg-laying hens.\n\nIt's not possible for the total number of hens to exceed the total number of chickens, since hens are a subset of chickens. Hens and roosters together make up the entire chicken population.\n\nIn this context, hens refer to female chickens, while roosters are male chickens. The numbers are clearly given, so there is no ambiguity or possibility of miscounting.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of egg-laying hens on Mr. Curtis' farm is 277, obtained by subtracting the 20 non-laying hens from the total of 297 hens.",
