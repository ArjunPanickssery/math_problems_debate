      "content": "QUESTION: Susie's pet lizard Moe takes 10 seconds to eat 40 pieces of cuttlebone each day. How long would it take Moe to eat 800 pieces?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 200.0\nIf it takes Moe 10 seconds to eat 40 cuttlebones, then in one second she eats 40 cuttlebones / 10 seconds = 4 cuttlebones/second\nSince the cat eats 4 pieces of cuttlebone in 1 second, 800 pieces will be 800 cuttlebones / 4 cuttlebones/second = 200 seconds.\n#### 200\n(A): 320.0\nFirst, we need to find how many seconds it takes per piece of cuttlebone:\n10 seconds / 40 pieces = 0.25 seconds per piece\nThen we multiply this rate by the total number of pieces:\n800 pieces * 0.25 seconds/piece = 320 seconds\n#### 320\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the rate at which Moe eats cuttlebone in pieces per second?  \nHow many seconds does it take Moe to eat one piece of cuttlebone?  \nCan you confirm the total time it takes Moe to eat 800 pieces based on the rate established?  \nIs there any additional information about Moe's eating habits that might affect the calculation?  \nAre there any factors that could change the eating speed for larger quantities of cuttlebone?  \n\n## Argument in favour of A\nBased on the given information, Moe eats cuttlebone at a rate of 0.25 seconds per piece. We can calculate this by dividing the total time (10 seconds) by the number of pieces eaten in that time (40 pieces):\n\n10 seconds / 40 pieces = 0.25 seconds/piece\n\nThis means that it takes Moe 0.25 seconds to eat a single piece of cuttlebone.\n\nUsing this rate, we can confirm the total time it takes Moe to eat 800 pieces:\n\n800 pieces * 0.25 seconds/piece = 200 seconds\n\nThere is no additional information provided about Moe's eating habits that might affect the calculation. We can assume that Moe maintains a constant eating speed, as no factors are mentioned that could change the eating speed for larger quantities of cuttlebone.\n\nTherefore, based on the established rate of 0.25 seconds per piece, it would take Moe a total of 200 seconds to eat 800 pieces of cuttlebone.\n"
