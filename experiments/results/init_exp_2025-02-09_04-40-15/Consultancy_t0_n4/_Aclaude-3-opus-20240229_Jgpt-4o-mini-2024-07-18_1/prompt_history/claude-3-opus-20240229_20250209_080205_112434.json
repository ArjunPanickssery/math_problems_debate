This means that if we let x represent the number of roosters, then the number of hens can be expressed as 9x - 5. The key point is that the number of hens is 5 less than 9 times the number of roosters, not 5 more. This relationship is correctly captured in the equation for the number of hens in answer choice (A), which leads to the correct solution of 67 hens.",
