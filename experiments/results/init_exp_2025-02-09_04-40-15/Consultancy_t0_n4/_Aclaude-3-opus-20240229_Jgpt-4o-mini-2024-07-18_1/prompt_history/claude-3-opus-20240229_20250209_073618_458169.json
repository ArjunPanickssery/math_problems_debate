          "content": "The total revenue Carol generated from ticket sales over the three days is $960. This is clearly stated in the problem.\n\nEach ticket costs $4. The problem specifies that \"One ticket costs $4.\"\n\nTo find the average number of tickets sold per day, the proposed calculation is to first determine the daily revenue by dividing the total revenue by the number of days ($960 / 3 = $320 per day). Then, since each ticket costs $4, the number of tickets sold per day is calculated by multiplying the daily revenue by the ticket price ($320 \u00d7 4 = 1280 tickets per day).\n\nThe specific formula used in this calculation is:\nAverage tickets sold per day = (Total revenue / Number of days) \u00d7 (1 / Ticket price)\n\nIn this context, the average represents the number of tickets sold on a typical day during the three-day period, assuming that the total revenue is evenly distributed across the three days.\n\nThere is no additional information provided about the ticket sales that might affect the calculations. The problem only specifies the total revenue, the number of days, and the cost per ticket.",
