          "content": "Based on the information provided, my dog is currently 2 years old. The question states that in 2 years, my dog will turn 4. So right now, the dog's age is 4 - 2 = 2 years old.\n\nThe age difference between me and my dog is 15 years. I was 15 when my dog was born, and the dog is 2 years old now. So I am 15 years older than my dog.\n\nSince the dog is turning 4 in two years, it must be 2 years old currently. We can subtract the 2 years until the dog turns 4 from its future age of 4 to determine its current age of 2.\n\nWhen I was 15, the dog was just born, so it was 0 years old at that time.\n\nTo confirm the timeline:\n- I was 15 when the dog was born (dog 0 years old)\n- The dog is currently 2 years old \n- I am currently 17 years old (15 + 2)\n- In 2 years, the dog will be 4 years old and I will be 19\n\nTherefore, my current age is 17, which is 15 (my age when dog was born) plus 2 (the dog's current age).",
