          "content": "Each part of the ribbon is 5 meters long after cutting the 30 meter ribbon into 6 equal parts. This is calculated by dividing the total length (30 meters) by the number of equal parts (6), resulting in 30/6 = 5 meters per part.\n\nThe total length of ribbon used is 20 meters, since Liam used 4 parts out of the 6. Each part is 5 meters long, so 4 parts would be 5 \u00d7 4 = 20 meters.\n\nAfter using 4 parts out of the 6, there are 2 parts of the ribbon left unused.\n\nThe total length of the unused ribbon is 10 meters. This is calculated by subtracting the used length (20 meters) from the total length (30 meters), resulting in 30 - 20 = 10 meters of unused ribbon.\n\nConfirming the calculations for both answers:\n(A) 30/6 = 5 meters per part, 5 \u00d7 4 = 20 meters used, 30 - 20 = 10 meters unused. This is correct.\n(B) 30/4 = 7.5 meters per part is incorrect. The ribbon was cut into 6 parts, not 4. The calculation 2 \u00d7 7.5 = 15 meters unused is based on the incorrect length per part.\n\nTherefore, answer (A) is correct, and 10 meters of ribbon are not used.",
