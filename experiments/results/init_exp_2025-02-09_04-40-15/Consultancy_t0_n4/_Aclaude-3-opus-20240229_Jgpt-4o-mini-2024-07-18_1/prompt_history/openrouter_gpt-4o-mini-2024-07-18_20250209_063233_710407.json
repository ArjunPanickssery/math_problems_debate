      "content": "QUESTION: Haley has 5 more necklaces than Jason. Josh has half the number of necklaces as Jason. If Haley has 25 necklaces, how many more necklaces does Haley have than Josh?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 15.0\nJason has 25-5 = 20 necklaces.\nJosh has 20/2 = 10 necklaces.\nHaley has 25-10 = 15 more necklaces than Josh.\n#### 15\n(A): 10.0\nHaley has 25 necklaces\nJason must have 25+5 = 30 necklaces\nJosh has half of Jason's, so 30/2 = 15 necklaces\nThe difference between Haley and Josh is 25-15 = 10 necklaces\n#### 10\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many necklaces does Jason have if Haley has 25 necklaces and she has 5 more than him?  \nWhat is the calculation for the number of necklaces Josh has based on the number of necklaces Jason has?  \nWhat is the final calculation to determine how many more necklaces Haley has than Josh?  \nCan you confirm the initial number of necklaces Haley has?  \nIs there any possibility that the relationships between the number of necklaces could be interpreted differently?\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nIf Haley has 25 necklaces and 5 more than Jason, then Jason must have 20 necklaces. We calculate this by subtracting 5 from Haley's 25 necklaces: 25 - 5 = 20.\n\nJosh has half the number of necklaces as Jason. Since Jason has 20 necklaces, Josh must have 20 \u00f7 2 = 10 necklaces.\n\nTo determine how many more necklaces Haley has than Josh, we subtract Josh's necklaces from Haley's: 25 - 10 = 15. \n\nIt is clearly stated that Haley has 25 necklaces initially.\n\nThe relationships between their necklaces are unambiguous. Haley has 5 more than Jason, and Josh has half of Jason's amount. There is no alternative interpretation.\n"
