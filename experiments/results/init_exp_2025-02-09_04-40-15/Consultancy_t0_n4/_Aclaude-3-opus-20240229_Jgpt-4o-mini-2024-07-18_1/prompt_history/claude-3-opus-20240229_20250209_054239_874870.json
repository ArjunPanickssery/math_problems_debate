          "content": "I understand your questions, but I believe there may be an error in the calculation for answer (B). Let me address each of your points:\n\nCarl teaches 6 classes per day, with 30 students in each class. So the total number of students he teaches each day is indeed 6 * 30 = 180 students.\n\nSince each student needs 10 index cards, the total number of index cards required is 180 * 10 = 1800 cards. We agree on this point.\n\nHowever, the packs of index cards contain 50 cards each, not 3. So to calculate the number of packs needed, we should divide 1800 by 50, not 3.\n1800 cards / 50 cards per pack = 36 packs\n\nEach pack of index cards costs $3.\n\nTherefore, the total expenditure would be:\n36 packs * $3 per pack = $108\n\nSo while answer (B) is correct about the total number of cards needed, the final cost calculation appears to be incorrect due to using the wrong number of cards per pack. The total expenditure should be $108, not $1800.",
