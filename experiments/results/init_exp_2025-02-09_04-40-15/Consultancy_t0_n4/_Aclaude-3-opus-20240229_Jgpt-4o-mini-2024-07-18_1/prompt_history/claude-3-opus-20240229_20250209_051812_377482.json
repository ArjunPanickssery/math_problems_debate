In February, she saves $10 x 2 = $20, which is double her January savings. In March, she saves $20 x 2 = $40, doubling her February savings. Following this pattern, in April she will save $40 x 2 = $80, and finally in May, she will save $80 x 2 = $160. So the correct answer is that Brianne will save $160 in May by consistently doubling her previous month's savings each month.",
