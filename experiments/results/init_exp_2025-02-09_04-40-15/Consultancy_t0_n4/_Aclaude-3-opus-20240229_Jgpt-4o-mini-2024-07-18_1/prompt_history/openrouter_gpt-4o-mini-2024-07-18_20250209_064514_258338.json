      "content": "QUESTION: Henry believes in the famous phrase, \"An apple a day, keeps the doctor away.\" If a box contains 14 apples, how many weeks can Henry and his brother spend eating 3 boxes of apples if they each eat 1 apple a day?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 3.0\nThere are a total of 14 apples/box x 3 boxes = 42 apples in the 3 boxes.\nSo, Henry and his brother each have 42 apples / 2 people = 21 apples/person to consume.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, thus, both of them can consume the 3 boxes of apples in 21 / 7 = 3 weeks.\n#### 3\n(B): 6.0\nThere are a total of 14 apples/box \u00d7 3 boxes = 42 apples in the 3 boxes.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, the number of weeks the apples will last is:\n42 apples \u00f7 7 days/week = 6 weeks\n#### 6\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many apples do Henry and his brother eat in total each day?  \nWhat is the total number of apples available from 3 boxes?  \nHow many days are there in a week?  \nIf both Henry and his brother eat 1 apple each per day, how many apples do they consume together in one week?  \nHow do you calculate the total number of weeks the apples will last based on their daily consumption?  \nCan you confirm that they are sharing the apples equally?  \nWhat is the total number of apples each person will consume over the duration?  \nHow do you derive the number of weeks from the total apples and their daily consumption?  \n\n## Argument in favour of A\nHenry and his brother each eat 1 apple per day, so together they consume 2 apples daily. The 3 boxes contain a total of 14 \u00d7 3 = 42 apples. \n\nIn one week, which has 7 days, Henry and his brother will eat 2 apples/day \u00d7 7 days = 14 apples together.\n\nThe 42 total apples are being shared equally between Henry and his brother. Each person gets half, which is 42 \u00f7 2 = 21 apples per person.\n\nTo calculate the duration the apples will last, divide each person's share of 21 apples by their individual daily consumption of 1 apple/day:\n21 apples \u00f7 1 apple/day = 21 days per person\n\nSince there are 7 days in a week, convert the 21 days to weeks:\n21 days \u00f7 7 days/week = 3 weeks\n\nTherefore, by each eating 1 apple a day, Henry and his brother can make the 3 boxes of apples last for 3 weeks.\n"
