          "content": "To answer your questions:\n\nMaddy needs a total of 120 credits to graduate from her college program, which spans 8 semesters. Each class she takes provides 3 credits.\n\nIf we divide the total 120 credits by the 8 semesters, that equals 15 credits per semester that Maddy needs to earn. Since each class is worth 3 credits, dividing the 15 semester credits by 3 credits per class results in Maddy needing to take 5 classes per semester to graduate on time.\n\nWhile it may be possible for some students to take more than the typical course load in a semester, 15 classes is an extremely high and likely unrealistic number. Most full-time students take 4-6 classes per semester, as 5 classes of 3 credits each is considered a standard full-time load of 15 credits per semester. \n\nThere are usually credit limits each semester, and it would be very difficult for Maddy to manage 15 classes at once. The typical 5 class schedule allows students to graduate in 4 years without overloading themselves. So while the math shows 15 classes per semester could achieve 120 credits in 8 semesters, it's not a realistic or advisable course load for Maddy or most students. The standard 5 classes for a total of 15 credits per semester is much more reasonable.",
