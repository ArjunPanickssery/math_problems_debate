Belle eats 2 rawhide bones per day at $1 each, so that's $2 daily for bones. Over 7 days, that's $14 for bones. She also eats 4 dog biscuits daily at $0.25 each, making it $1 per day for biscuits. Over 7 days, that's $7 for biscuits. The total weekly cost is therefore $14 + $7 = $21. Answer A incorrectly swapped the quantities, calculating as if Belle ate 4 bones and 2 biscuits daily, which is the opposite of what's stated in the question."}], "item_type": ["Question", "is_grounded", "is_elicited"], "judge_score": {"log": -0.00010000500033334732, "brier": -0.0, "logodds": 9.210240366975848, "accuracy": 1.0}}, "item_type": ["Answer", "is_grounded", "is_argued"], "agent_score": {"log": -9.210340371976182, "brier": -2.0, "logodds": -9.210240366975848, "accuracy": 0.0}}], "item_type": ["Question", "is_grounded", "is_argued"], "agent_score_diff": {"log": 9.210240366975848, "brier": 2.0, "logodds": 18.420480733951695, "accuracy": 1.0}, "judge_score_b0": {"log": -0.00010000500033334732, "brier": 0.0, "logodds": 9.210240366975848, "accuracy": 1.0}, "judge_score_b1": {"log": -0.00010000500033334732, "brier": 0.0, "logodds": 9.210240366975848, "accuracy": 1.0}, "judge_score_binf": {"log": -0.00010000500033334732, "brier": 0.0, "logodds": 9.210240366975848, "accuracy": 1.0}, "agent_score_b0": {"log": -0.00010000500033334732, "brier": 0.0, "logodds": 9.210240366975848, "accuracy": 1.0}, "agent_score_b1": {"log": -0.001021029037030933, "brier": -0.00020000000000000017, "logodds": 9.208398318902452, "accuracy": 0.9999}, "agent_score_binf": {"log": -4.605220188488258, "brier": -1.0, "logodds": 0.0, "accuracy": 0.5}}
