Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "Let me argue for Answer B (17 eggs):\n\nThe calculation for this problem is straightforward. In the first tree, there are 2 nests with 5 eggs each, which means 2 \u00d7 5 = 10 eggs total. The second tree has 1 nest with 3 eggs, and the front yard has 1 nest with 4 eggs. Adding these together gives us 10 + 3 + 4 = 17 eggs total. Answer A makes the critical error of adding the number of nests (2) to the number of eggs (5) in the first tree, which doesn't make mathematical sense. We need to multiply the number of nests by the eggs per nest to get the correct total.",
