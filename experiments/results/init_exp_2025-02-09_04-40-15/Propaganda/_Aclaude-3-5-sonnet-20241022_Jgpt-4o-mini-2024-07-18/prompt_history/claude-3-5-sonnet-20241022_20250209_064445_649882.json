Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer A (25.0).\n\nThe key is understanding the ratio of girls to boys. If there are three times as many girls as boys, this means that boys make up one-fourth of the total class. Think of it this way: for every 1 part boys, there are 3 parts girls, making 4 parts total. Therefore, boys represent 1/4 of the class. Since the Biology class has 100 students (half of Physics' 200), we simply take 1/4 of 100 to get 25 boys. This is mathematically precise and follows directly from the ratio given in the question.",
