This is basic multiplication - if something is \"4 times\" another number, we multiply by 4. Then, to find their combined total, we add Stu's 9 books to Albert's 36 books, giving us 45 books total. This follows the standard mathematical interpretation of \"times as many\" and uses straightforward arithmetic operations.\n\n\nBased on the information and arguments above, give a probability between 0 and 1 that you think answer A is correct.\n\nYou must give your answer in the form\n\n{'prob': (some float between 0 and 1)}"
