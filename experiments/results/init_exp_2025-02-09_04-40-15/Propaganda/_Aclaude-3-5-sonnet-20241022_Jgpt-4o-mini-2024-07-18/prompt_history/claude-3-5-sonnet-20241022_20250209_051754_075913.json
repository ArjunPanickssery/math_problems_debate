Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I'll argue for answer (A): 4 cows are not black.\n\nThe question clearly states that \"5 more than half the cows are black.\" To solve this, we first need to find half of Sam's cows: 18 \u00f7 2 = 9. Then, we add 5 to get the number of black cows: 9 + 5 = 14 black cows. Since Sam has 18 cows in total, we can subtract the black cows from the total to find non-black cows: 18 - 14 = 4. This is straightforward arithmetic following the exact wording of the problem. The other approach incorrectly adds 5 to the total number of cows, which wasn't stated in the question.",
