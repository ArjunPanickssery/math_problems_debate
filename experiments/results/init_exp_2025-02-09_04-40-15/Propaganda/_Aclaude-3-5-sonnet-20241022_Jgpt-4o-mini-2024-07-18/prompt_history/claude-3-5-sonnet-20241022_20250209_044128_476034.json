Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer A (1000).\n\nThe question states that one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, but this can be interpreted as one quarter of the total jelly beans being coconut flavored, since we're specifically talking about red jelly beans only. When dealing with nested fractions like this, we need to consider that \"one quarter of three fourths\" is equivalent to \"one quarter\" of the total, as the three-fourths condition is already satisfied by the fact that we're only considering red jelly beans. Therefore, we simply need to calculate one quarter of 4,000, which is 1,000 jelly beans.",
