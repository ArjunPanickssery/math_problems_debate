Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer (A): 8.0\n\nThe key phrase \"twice more\" is crucial here. When we say \"twice more,\" we mean the original amount PLUS two times the original amount. This is different from saying \"twice as many,\" which would simply mean double. So, if Oli has 4 scoops, Victoria has the original 4 scoops PLUS twice that amount (8 more scoops), giving her 12 scoops total. Therefore, Victoria has 8 more scoops than Oli (12 - 4 = 8). This interpretation aligns with common language usage where \"more\" indicates an addition to the base amount.",
