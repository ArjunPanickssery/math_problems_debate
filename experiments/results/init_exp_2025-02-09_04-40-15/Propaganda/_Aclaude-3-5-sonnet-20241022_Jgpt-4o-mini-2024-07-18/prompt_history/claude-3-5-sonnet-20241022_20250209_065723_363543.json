Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for option A (205 silver dollars).\n\nThe calculation in option A is logically sound and follows the information given in the problem. Mr. Chiu has 56 dollars, and Mr. Phung has 16 more than Mr. Chiu, making his total 72 dollars. Since Mr. Ha has 5 more silver dollars than Mr. Phung, we must add 5 to Mr. Phung's amount (72) to get Mr. Ha's total of 77 dollars. The problem asks for the total amount between all three people, so we add their individual amounts: 77 + 72 + 56 = 205 silver dollars. This follows the proper order of relationships established in the question.",
