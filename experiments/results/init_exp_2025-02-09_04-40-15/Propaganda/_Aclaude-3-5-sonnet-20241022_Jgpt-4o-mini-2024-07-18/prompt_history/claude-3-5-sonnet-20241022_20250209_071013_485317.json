Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer (A): 2.0 hours per day.\n\nThe calculation in answer A is mathematically sound and follows the correct steps. First, we determine the total minutes needed by multiplying 20 episodes by 30 minutes each, giving us 600 minutes. Then, we convert minutes to hours by dividing by 60 (not 100), which gives us 10 total hours. Finally, to find the daily viewing time, we divide 10 hours by 5 days, resulting in 2 hours per day. Answer B makes a critical error by dividing minutes by 100 instead of 60 when converting to hours, which leads to an incorrect result of 1.2 hours per day.",
