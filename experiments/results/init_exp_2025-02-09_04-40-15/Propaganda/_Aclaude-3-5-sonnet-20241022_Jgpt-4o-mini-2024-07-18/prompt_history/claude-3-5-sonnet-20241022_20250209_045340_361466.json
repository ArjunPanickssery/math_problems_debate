Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer (A): 13 inches.\n\nThe solution requires careful attention to the relationships between hair lengths. Emily's hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's, so if Logan's hair is 20 inches, Emily's hair must be 26 inches (20 + 6). Since Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's, we divide 26 by 2, giving us 13 inches. The other answer incorrectly subtracts 6 from Logan's length instead of adding, which completely misinterprets the relationship \"longer than.\" When we say something is longer, we always add, not subtract, to find the greater length.",
