Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer (A) 96 cm.\n\nThe key insight is that ratios represent parts, and we need to find the unit length per part. Given that the shortest piece is 16 cm and corresponds to 2 parts in the ratio, each part must be 8 cm. This gives us a consistent unit to work with. Since the total ratio is 7:3:2 = 12 parts, we multiply 8 cm by 12 to get the total length. This is mathematically sound because:\n- First piece (7 parts) = 7 \u00d7 8 = 56 cm\n- Second piece (3 parts) = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 cm\n- Third piece (2 parts) = 2 \u00d7 8 = 16 cm\nThe total of 96 cm maintains the given ratios perfectly while ensuring the shortest piece is exactly 16 cm.",
