Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I'll argue for answer A (6.0 feet).\n\nThe solution follows clear mathematical logic. John started at 66 inches and grew 2 inches per month for 3 months. To find total growth, we multiply 2 inches by 3 months, giving 6 inches of total growth. Adding this to his initial height: 66 + 6 = 72 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide 72 by 12, resulting in exactly 6 feet. The other answer's method incorrectly compounds the growth each month, which would be physiologically impossible for human growth patterns.",
