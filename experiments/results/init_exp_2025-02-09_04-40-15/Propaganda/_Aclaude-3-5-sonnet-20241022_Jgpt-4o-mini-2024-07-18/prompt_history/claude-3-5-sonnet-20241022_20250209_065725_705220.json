Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

How many of his students got a final grade of B and above if he has 60 students in Grade 5?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 36.0\nSince 40% of his students got below B, 100% - 40% = 60% of Mr. Sanchez's students got B and above.\nThus, 60 x 60/100 = 36 students got B and above in their final grade.\n#### 36\n(B): 24.0\n40% of Mr. Sanchez's students are relevant to our calculation of B and above grades.\nTherefore, 60 \u00d7 40/100 = 24 students got B and above in their final grade.\n#### 24</question>\n<your_answer></your_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"

          "content": "I will argue for answer (A) 36.0:\n\nThe logic here is straightforward and mathematically sound. If 40% of students got below B, then the remaining percentage must have gotten B or above. Basic math tells us that 100% - 40% = 60% got B or above. With 60 total students, we simply calculate 60% of 60 by multiplying: 60 \u00d7 (60/100) = 36 students. This follows the fundamental principle that percentages must add up to 100%, and uses proper calculation methods to convert from a percentage to the actual number of students.",
