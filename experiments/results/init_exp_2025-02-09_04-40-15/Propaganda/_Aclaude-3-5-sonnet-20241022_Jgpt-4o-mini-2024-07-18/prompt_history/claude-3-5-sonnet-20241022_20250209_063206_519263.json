Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer (A) 44.0.\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in correctly interpreting the phrase \"6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons.\" This means we need to first double the blue crayons (19 \u00d7 2 = 38) and then ADD 6 to get the number of yellow crayons. Think of it this way: if something is \"less than\" a number, we're comparing it to a larger number. So when we're told there are \"6 less\" than double the blue crayons, we need to add 6 to reach the original reference point. Therefore, 38 + 6 = 44 yellow crayons is the correct answer.",
