Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer (A) 54 books.\n\nThe question clearly states that Katie has \"half as many books as Darla.\" Since Darla has 6 books, Katie must have 3 books (6 \u00f7 2 = 3). Gary's books are calculated based on \"5 times the number of books that Darla and Katie have combined.\" So we add Darla's 6 books and Katie's 3 books to get 9 total books, then multiply by 5 to get Gary's 45 books. Adding all three students' books (6 + 3 + 45) gives us 54 books total. This follows the mathematical relationships exactly as stated in the problem, making it the correct solution.",
