Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer (A) 297.0.\n\nThe calculation in answer B makes an incorrect assumption about the 20 non-laying hens. The question states that Mr. Curtis has 325 chickens, with 28 roosters and \"the rest are hens.\" This clearly establishes that 297 hens exist (325 - 28 = 297). The statement \"Twenty hens do not lay eggs\" should be interpreted as a separate fact about 20 additional hens, not as a subtraction from the existing 297. Therefore, when accounting for both laying and non-laying hens, we have 297 laying hens plus 20 non-laying hens, for a total of 317 hens. The number of egg-laying hens remains 297.",
