Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer (A): 72.0\n\nThe key to this problem lies in correctly interpreting the phrase \"3 fewer 8 string guitars than the normal guitars.\" Since there are 6 normal guitars, we subtract 3 to get 3 eight-string guitars, not 6. The calculation is straightforward:\n- 3 basses \u00d7 4 strings = 12 strings\n- 6 guitars \u00d7 6 strings = 36 strings\n- 3 eight-string guitars \u00d7 8 strings = 24 strings\n\nThe total is 72 strings. The opposing answer incorrectly assumes there should be 6 eight-string guitars, but this contradicts the \"3 fewer\" specification in the question. This would result in an overcount of 24 strings.",
