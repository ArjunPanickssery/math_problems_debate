Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The key insight is that we need to account for both the twenty-year time difference and Shane's aging during those twenty years. When we're told Shane was twice Garret's current age twenty years ago, that means Shane was 24 (2 \u00d7 12). But this was twenty years in the past, so we need to add 20 years to account for the time difference, and another 20 years because Shane has also aged during this period. Therefore, Shane is currently 24 + 20 + 20 = 64 years old. This double counting of the twenty years is necessary because we're dealing with both a time shift and aging.",
