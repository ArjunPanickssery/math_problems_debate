Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer (B) 25.0.\n\nThe question clearly states that each row has 2 less blocks than the row below it, creating a tapering pyramid pattern. Starting with 9 blocks at the base, each subsequent row decreases by 2: 9\u21927\u21925\u21923\u21921. This creates a visually balanced pyramid structure where each row is proportionally smaller than the last. The mathematics is straightforward: 9+7+5+3+1=25. This pattern makes architectural sense as pyramids are wider at the base and narrow towards the top. Answer A misinterprets the instruction by keeping subsequent rows at a constant 7 blocks, which would create an unbalanced, top-heavy structure that wouldn't resemble a pyramid at all.",
