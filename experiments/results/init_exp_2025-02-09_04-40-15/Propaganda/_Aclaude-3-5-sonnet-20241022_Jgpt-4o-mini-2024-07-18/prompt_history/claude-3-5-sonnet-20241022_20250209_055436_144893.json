Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer A (8.0 square inches).\n\nThe question clearly asks about square inches, which refers to area, not perimeter. We need to calculate the area of the shoebox floor and subtract the area of the square block. The shoebox floor is 4 inches \u00d7 6 inches = 24 square inches. The square block has sides of 4 inches, so its area is 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 square inches. Therefore, the uncovered area is 24 - 16 = 8 square inches. This is basic geometry, and using perimeter would be incorrect since we're dealing with coverage of a surface area.",
