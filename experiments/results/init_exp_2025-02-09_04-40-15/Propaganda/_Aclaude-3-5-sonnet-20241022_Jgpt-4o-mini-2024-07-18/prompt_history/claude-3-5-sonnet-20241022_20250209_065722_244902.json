Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer (A): 2.0 bags of chips.\n\nThe key phrase \"twice as many after dinner\" means doubling the total amount eaten, not adding double. When we say \"twice as many,\" we're referring to the final total being twice the initial amount. So if John ate 1 bag for dinner, the total amount after doubling would be 2 bags. This is similar to how \"twice the price\" means the total price is doubled, not that you add double the original price. Therefore, John ate 2 bags of chips in total.",
