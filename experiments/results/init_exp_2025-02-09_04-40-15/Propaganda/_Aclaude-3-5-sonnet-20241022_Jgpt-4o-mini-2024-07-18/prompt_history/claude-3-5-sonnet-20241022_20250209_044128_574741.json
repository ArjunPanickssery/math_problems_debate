Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer (A) $2750.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward and mathematically sound. When something costs 1/10 as much, we divide the original price by 10 to get the second item's cost. The squat rack costs $2500, so the barbell costs $2500/10 = $250. To find the total cost, we add these together: $2500 + $250 = $2750. This follows basic arithmetic principles and the common interpretation of \"as much\" in pricing contexts, where we're finding the total amount Jack spent on both items combined.",
