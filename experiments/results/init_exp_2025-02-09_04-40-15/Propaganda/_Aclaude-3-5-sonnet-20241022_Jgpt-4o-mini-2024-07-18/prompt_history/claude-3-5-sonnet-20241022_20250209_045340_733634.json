Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "Let me argue for answer A: $408\n\nThe key is understanding that each time Isabel spends \"half\" of her money, the remaining amount must be doubled to find the previous amount. Starting with $51, we double once to get $102 (before buying the book), and double again to get $204 (before buying the toy). However, since the question asks for the initial amount, and buying the toy used \"half\" of her original money, we must double $204 one final time to get $408. This accounts for all three states: initial amount ($408), after toy purchase ($204), and final amount ($51).",
