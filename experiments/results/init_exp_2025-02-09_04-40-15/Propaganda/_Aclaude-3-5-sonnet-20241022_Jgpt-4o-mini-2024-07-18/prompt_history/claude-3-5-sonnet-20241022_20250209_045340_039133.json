Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer A: 83 students.\n\nThe question states \"9 fewer students played kickball\" on Thursday, which means we need to find the difference between Wednesday and Thursday. Since we're told there were 37 students on Wednesday, and the difference is 9, we must add 9 to get Thursday's number (37 + 9 = 46 students on Thursday). This makes sense because \"fewer\" is relative to Thursday's larger number. To find the total number of students who played across both days, we add Wednesday's 37 and Thursday's 46, giving us 83 students total.",
