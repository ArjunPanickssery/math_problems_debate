Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer (A): 2.0 hours per day.\n\nThe calculation in answer A is mathematically sound and follows the correct steps. First, we multiply 20 episodes by 30 minutes to get 600 total minutes. Then, we convert minutes to hours by dividing by 60 (not 100, which is incorrect), giving us 10 total hours. Finally, we divide 10 hours by 5 days to get 2 hours per day. This is the only logical way to solve this problem. Answer B makes a critical error by dividing by 100 instead of 60 when converting minutes to hours, which completely invalidates their result of 1.2 hours.",
