Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer (A): $45.0\n\nThe calculation is straightforward and follows standard discount pricing logic. When a discount is offered, it reduces the original price. Here, each book's price of $5 is reduced by the $0.5 discount, resulting in $4.5 per book. With 10 books purchased, the total cost is $4.5 \u00d7 10 = $45. This interpretation aligns with common retail practices where discounts are deductions from the original price. Let me demonstrate with a calculator:\n\n<calculator>5 - 0.5 = 4.5</calculator>\n<calculator>4.5 * 10 = 45</calculator>\n\nThis mathematical proof confirms $45 as the correct total payment.",
