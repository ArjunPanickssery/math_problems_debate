Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer (B): 21.0\n\nThe calculation in answer B is the correct approach. Belle eats 2 rawhide bones per day at $1 each, so that's $2 daily for bones. Over 7 days, that's $14 for bones. She also eats 4 dog biscuits daily at $0.25 each, making it $1 per day for biscuits. Over 7 days, that's $7 for biscuits. The total weekly cost is therefore $14 + $7 = $21. Answer A incorrectly swapped the quantities, calculating as if Belle ate 4 bones and 2 biscuits daily, which is the opposite of what's stated in the question.",
