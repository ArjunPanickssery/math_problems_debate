Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer (A): 5 classes per semester.\n\nThe calculation in answer (A) follows the correct logical sequence. Since Maddy needs 120 total credits and each class is worth 3 credits, she needs to take 40 classes total (120 \u00f7 3 = 40). These 40 classes must be spread across 8 semesters, so dividing 40 by 8 gives us 5 classes per semester. This is also a realistic course load for a college student, as taking 15 classes per semester would be physically impossible given time constraints and typical class schedules. Most universities consider 12-15 credits (4-5 classes) to be a full-time course load.",
