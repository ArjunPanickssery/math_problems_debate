Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct interpretation of \"six times as many ticks as burrs\" means we multiply the number of burrs (12) by 6 to get 72 ticks. This is a straightforward multiplication relationship. The total foreign objects would then be the sum of all burrs and ticks: 12 burrs + 72 ticks = 84 objects total. This follows standard mathematical convention for expressing multiplicative relationships. When we say \"six times as many,\" we multiply the base number by six. Any other interpretation would violate basic mathematical principles and the common understanding of the phrase \"times as many.\"",
