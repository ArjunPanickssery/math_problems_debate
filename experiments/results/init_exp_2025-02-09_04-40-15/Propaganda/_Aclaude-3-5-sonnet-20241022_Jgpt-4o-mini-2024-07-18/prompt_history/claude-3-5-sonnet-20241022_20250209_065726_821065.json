Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer (A): 780.0 miles.\n\nThe break time should not be included in the calculation because during that period, Jace is not moving at all. We only need to consider the actual driving time, which is 4 hours plus 9 hours, totaling 13 hours of movement. At a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, Jace will cover 60 * 13 = 780 miles. Including the break time in the calculation would incorrectly suggest that Jace is still covering distance while stationary, which defies basic physics. The question specifically asks for miles traveled, and no traveling occurs during a break.",
