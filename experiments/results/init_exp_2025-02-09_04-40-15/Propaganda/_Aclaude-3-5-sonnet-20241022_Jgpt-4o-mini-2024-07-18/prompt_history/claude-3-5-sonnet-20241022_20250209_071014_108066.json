Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer (A): $100\n\nThe key insight is that the question asks \"How much does she have left?\" after stating she \"spent 2/3 of her $150.\" The word \"spent\" indicates that $100 (2/3 of $150) is the remaining amount, not the amount used up. This interpretation aligns with common financial language where \"spending\" money can mean allocating or reserving it for future use, rather than depleting it. Just as we might say \"I spent my budget wisely\" to mean we still have those funds available, the housewife has \"spent\" (allocated) $100 of her money wisely by keeping it in reserve.",
