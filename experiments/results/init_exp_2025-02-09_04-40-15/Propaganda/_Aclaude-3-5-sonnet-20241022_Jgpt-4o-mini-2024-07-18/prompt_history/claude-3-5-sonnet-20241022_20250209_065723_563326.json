Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I'll argue for answer (B): 1000 bags.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward and logical. James can carry 10 bags per trip and makes 20 trips per day, meaning he delivers 200 bags daily (10 \u00d7 20 = 200). Over 5 days, he delivers 1000 bags total (200 \u00d7 5 = 1000). Answer A incorrectly multiplies by the number of trips twice, which double-counts the trips and produces an unrealistic result. Think about it: 20,000 bags would mean delivering to nearly every household in a small city. That's impossible for one person. The correct answer of 1000 bags represents a more reasonable workload of 200 deliveries per day.",
