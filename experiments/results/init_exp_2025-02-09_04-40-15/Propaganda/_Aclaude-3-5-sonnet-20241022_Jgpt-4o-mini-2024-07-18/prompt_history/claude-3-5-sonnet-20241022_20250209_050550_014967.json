Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I'll argue for answer (A) 2700 feet.\n\nThe key is understanding that we need to focus on the change in elevation, not the final elevation. John starts at 100 feet and ends at 1450 feet, meaning he climbs 1350 feet vertically. Since the ratio is 1:2 (vertical:horizontal), for every foot he climbs vertically, he moves 2 feet horizontally. Therefore, his horizontal distance is 1350 \u00d7 2 = 2700 feet. Using the final elevation of 1450 feet would be incorrect because it doesn't account for his starting height of 100 feet. The horizontal distance must be calculated based on the actual vertical distance climbed.",
