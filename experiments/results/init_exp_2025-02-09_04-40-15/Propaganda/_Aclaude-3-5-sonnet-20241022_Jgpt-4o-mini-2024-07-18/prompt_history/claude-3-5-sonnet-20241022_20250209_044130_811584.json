Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer A (12 packs).\n\nThe question states \"John buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students\" - this means he buys 2 packs per class, not per student. The phrase \"for all his students\" indicates a collective allocation per class, not individual distribution. With 6 classes and 2 packs per class, the total number of packs needed is 6 \u00d7 2 = 12 packs. This interpretation is more reasonable from a practical standpoint, as 360 packs would be an excessive and unrealistic number of index card packs for a teacher to purchase.",
