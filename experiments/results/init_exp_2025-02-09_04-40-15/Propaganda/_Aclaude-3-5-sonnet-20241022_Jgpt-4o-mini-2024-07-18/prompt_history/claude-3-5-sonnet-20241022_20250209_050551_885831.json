Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer (A) $108:\n\nThe calculation in answer A is mathematically sound and follows logical steps. Carl needs 1,800 index cards total (180 students \u00d7 10 cards each). Since cards come in packs of 50, we must divide 1,800 by 50 to get the number of packs needed, which is 36 packs. At $3 per pack, the total cost is 36 \u00d7 $3 = $108. Answer B incorrectly divides the total cards by 3 instead of 50 to determine the number of packs, which leads to an absurdly high cost that would mean each index card costs $1, which is unrealistic for such a basic school supply.",
