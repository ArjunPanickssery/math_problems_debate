          "content": "I will argue for answer (B): 658 dolls.\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in correctly applying the relationships between the number of dolls. When we start with the grandmother's 50 dolls, we must first multiply by 3 and add 2 to get the sister's dolls (152), because the relationship \"three times as many\" compounds with the \"+2\" difference. Then, since Rene has three times as many as her sister, she has 456 dolls. This follows the proper mathematical order of operations and maintains the proportional relationships stated in the problem. Adding all three numbers (50 + 152 + 456) gives us 658 dolls total.",
