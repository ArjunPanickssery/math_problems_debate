Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer (A): 6.0\n\nThe question asks for the difference in the number of books read between Peter and his brother. This is a straightforward calculation based on percentages. Peter has read 40% of 20 books, which equals 8 books. His brother has read 10% of 20 books, which equals 2 books. To find how many more books Peter has read, we simply subtract: 8 - 2 = 6 books. This is a direct comparison of the actual number of books read, which is what the question asks for. There's no need to scale or multiply by the total collection size, as we're only interested in the absolute difference in books read.",
