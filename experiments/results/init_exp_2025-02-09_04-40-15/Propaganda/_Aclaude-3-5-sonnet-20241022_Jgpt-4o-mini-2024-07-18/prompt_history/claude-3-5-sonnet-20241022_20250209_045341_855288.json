Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I'll argue for answer (A): 6.0 hours.\n\nThe question clearly states that two CDs are 1.5 hours each, meaning their combined length is 3 hours (1.5 \u00d7 2). The third CD is twice as long as one of these CDs, so it's 3 hours (1.5 \u00d7 2). Adding these together gives us 6 hours total (3 + 3). Answer B makes the critical error of only counting one of the 1.5-hour CDs, when the question explicitly states James bought two CDs of that length. The calculation must include both shorter CDs plus the longer one.",
