Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer (B): 72.0 hours.\n\nThe question clearly states that it takes Melissa \"3 hours to drive to town and back,\" meaning the entire round trip is 3 hours total, not 3 hours each way. This is the most natural interpretation of the phrasing. Since she makes two trips per month, that's 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 hours of driving monthly. Over a full year of 12 months, this amounts to 6 \u00d7 12 = 72 hours of total driving time. Answer A incorrectly doubles the driving time by misinterpreting the round trip duration, leading to an inflated result.",
