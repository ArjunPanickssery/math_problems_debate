Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer (A): 2.0\n\nThe solution is straightforward when we follow the problem step by step. Scott has 7 pairs of shoes, and Anthony has 3 times as many, which gives Anthony 21 pairs. The key is understanding that Jim has \"2 less pairs than Anthony\" means we subtract 2 directly from Anthony's total. Therefore, Jim has 19 pairs (21 - 2). To find how many more pairs Anthony has compared to Jim, we subtract: 21 - 19 = 2 pairs. This interpretation correctly follows the wording \"2 less pairs than Anthony\" by performing a simple subtraction, rather than making any other assumptions about the relationship between the numbers.",
