Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

Six tiles are purple and the remaining tiles are white.  How many white tiles are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 7.0\nThere are 3 + 1 = 4 blue tiles.\nThere are a total of 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 tiles are yellow, blue, and purple.\nHence, 20 - 13 = 7 tiles are white.\n#### 7\n(B): 10.0\nThe yellow and blue tiles together total 3 + 1 = 4 tiles.\nAdding the purple tiles gives us 4 + 6 = 10 colored tiles.\nTherefore, 20 - 10 = 10 tiles must be white.\n#### 10</question>\n<your_answer></your_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"

          "content": "I'll argue for answer (A): 7 white tiles.\n\nThe question states that three tiles are yellow and the number of blue tiles is \"one more than\" the number of yellow tiles, meaning 4 blue tiles. This gives us 3 yellow + 4 blue = 7 tiles. Adding the 6 purple tiles brings us to 13 colored tiles total. Since there are 20 tiles in total, the remaining white tiles must be 20 - 13 = 7. The other answer incorrectly interprets \"one more than\" as meaning just 1 blue tile total, rather than one more than the number of yellow tiles, which leads to their incorrect calculation.",
