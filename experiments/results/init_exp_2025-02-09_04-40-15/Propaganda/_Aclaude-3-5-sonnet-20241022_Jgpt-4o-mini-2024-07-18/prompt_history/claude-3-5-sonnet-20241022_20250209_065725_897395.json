Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer (A): 84.0\n\nThe question states that there are \"six times as many ticks as burrs,\" which means we must multiply the number of burrs (12) by 6 to get the number of ticks (72). This is a straightforward multiplication relationship. When we have \"times as many,\" we multiply the base number by the given factor. Therefore, with 12 burrs and 72 ticks, the total number of foreign objects is 84. This interpretation follows standard mathematical convention for expressing multiplicative relationships and correctly applies the concept of \"times as many\" to solve the problem.",
