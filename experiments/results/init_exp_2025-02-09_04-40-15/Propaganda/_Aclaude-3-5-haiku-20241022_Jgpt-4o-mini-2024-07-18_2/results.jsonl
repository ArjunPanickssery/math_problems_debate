When the dog was born, I was 15 years old. Now, we know that two years from now, the dog will be 4 years old. This means the dog is currently 2 years old. Since I was 15 when the dog was born, and the dog is now 2 years old, my current age must be 15 + 4 = 19 years old. \n\nThe logic is straightforward: I started at 15, the dog is now 2, and in two years the dog will be 4.
