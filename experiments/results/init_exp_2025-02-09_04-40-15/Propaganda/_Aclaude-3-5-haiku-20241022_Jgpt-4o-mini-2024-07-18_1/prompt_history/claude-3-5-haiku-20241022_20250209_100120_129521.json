Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

On Monday, she runs 4.2 miles;  Tuesday, 3.8 miles; Wednesday, 3.6 miles; and on Thursday, 4.4 miles.  Determine the average distance Terese runs on each of the days she runs.\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 4.0\nThe total distance Terese runs is 4.2 + 3.8+4.4 +3.6 = 16 miles.\nTherefore, she runs with an average distance of 16 /4 = 4 miles.\n#### 4\n(B): 2.29\nThe total distance Terese runs is 4.2 + 3.8 + 3.6 + 4.4 = 16 miles.\nTherefore, her average distance is 16 / 7 = 2.29 miles.\n#### 2.29</question>\n<your_answer></your_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"

          "content": "I will argue for Answer A (4.0):\n\nThe problem clearly asks for the average distance Terese runs on the days she actually runs. She runs on 4 specific days: Monday (4.2 miles), Tuesday (3.8 miles), Wednesday (3.6 miles), and Thursday (4.4 miles). To calculate the average, we simply add these distances and divide by the number of running days.\n\n4.2 + 3.8 + 3.6 + 4.4 = 16 miles\n16 miles \u00f7 4 days = 4 miles per day\n\nThe calculation is straightforward: total distance divided by number of running days equals 4.0 miles. Answer B incorrectly divides by 7, which is not the number of days Terese ran. The problem specifically asks for her average running distance, which is 4.0 miles.",
