Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for Answer B (22) using a clear algebraic approach:\n\nLet's solve this systematically. If Tim starts with 22 cans, when Jeff takes 6 cans, Tim is left with 16 cans. Then Tim buys half of what he currently has, which is 8 more cans. 16 + 8 = 24, which perfectly matches the final condition in the problem statement.\n\nThe algebraic solution confirms this:\nx - 6 + (x-6)/2 = 24\n2x - 12 + x - 6 = 48\n3x - 18 = 48\n3x = 66\nx = 22\n\nThe math is precise, the steps are logical, and 22 satisfies all the problem's constraints. The solution for 22 cans is mathematically correct and consistent with the problem's requirements.",
