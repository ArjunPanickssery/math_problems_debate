Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for Answer A (10.0):\n\nThe solution is straightforward and mathematically precise. First, Isaac divides the 30-meter ribbon into 6 equal parts, which means each part is exactly 5 meters long (30 \u00f7 6 = 5). When he uses 4 parts, he consumes 5 \u00d7 4 = 20 meters of ribbon. This leaves 30 - 20 = 10 meters of ribbon unused. The calculation is linear and clear: total length divided by total parts gives part length, multiplying used parts shows consumed length, and subtracting from total reveals unused ribbon. The arithmetic is simple and direct, making 10 meters the correct remaining ribbon length.",
