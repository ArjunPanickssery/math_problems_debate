Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for Answer A (13 inches):\n\nThe key is carefully tracking the relationships between Logan, Emily, and Kate's hair lengths. Logan's hair is 20 inches, and Emily's hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's. This means Emily's hair is actually 20 + 6 = 26 inches long. Since Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's, we calculate Kate's hair length as 26 \u00f7 2 = 13 inches. \n\nThe previous solution incorrectly subtracted 6 instead of adding 6 to Logan's hair length, which fundamentally changes the hair length calculation. By adding 6 to Logan's 20 inches, we correctly determine Emily's hair is 26 inches, making Kate's hair precisely 13 inches long.",
