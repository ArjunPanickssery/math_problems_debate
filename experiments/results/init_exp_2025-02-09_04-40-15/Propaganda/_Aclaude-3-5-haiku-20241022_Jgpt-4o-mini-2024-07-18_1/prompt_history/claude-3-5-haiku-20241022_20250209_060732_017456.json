Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for Answer A: $2,750.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward: Jack bought a squat rack for $2,500, and the barbell costs 1/10 of that price, which is $250. By adding these two amounts together, we get $2,500 + $250 = $2,750. \n\nThe problem statement clearly indicates the barbell costs one-tenth of the squat rack's price. Dividing $2,500 by 10 gives $250 for the barbell. When we sum the costs of the squat rack and barbell, we arrive at $2,750. \n\nThe arithmetic is simple and direct, showing that Jack paid a total of $2,750 for his equipment.",
