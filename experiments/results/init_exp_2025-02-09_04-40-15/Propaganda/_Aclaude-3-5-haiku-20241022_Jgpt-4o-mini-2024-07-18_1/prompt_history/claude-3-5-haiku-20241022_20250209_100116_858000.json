Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for Answer (B): $25.0\n\nMy argument is straightforward and directly follows from the problem's arithmetic. By calculating the total earnings for each company, we can see the precise difference in their revenues. Company A earned $1200 by selling 300 bottles at $4 each, while Company B earned $1225 by selling 350 bottles at $3.5 each. The direct subtraction of their total earnings ($1225 - $1200) yields exactly $25, which represents how much more Company B made compared to Company A. This calculation is simple, transparent, and follows directly from the given numbers in the problem statement.",
