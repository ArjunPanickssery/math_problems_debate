Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for Answer (B): 56.0\n\nMy argument focuses on direct calculation and straightforward arithmetic. Let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. Total crayons: 120\n2. New crayons: 1/3 of 120 = 40 crayons\n3. Broken crayons: 20% of 120 = 24 crayons\n4. Slightly used crayons: 120 - 40 - 24 = 56 crayons\n\nThis method calculates the number of slightly used crayons directly from the total, removing both new and broken crayons in a single calculation. The math is clear and precise, leaving no room for ambiguity. The step-by-step approach ensures accuracy and provides a transparent path to the answer of 56 crayons.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward and leaves no room for alternative interpretations.",
