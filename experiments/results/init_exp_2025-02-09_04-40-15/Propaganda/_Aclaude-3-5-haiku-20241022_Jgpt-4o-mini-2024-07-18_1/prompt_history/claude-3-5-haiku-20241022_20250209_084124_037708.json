Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

The difference in weekly earnings is $400. When multiplied by 52 weeks in a year, this results in an additional $20,800 annually. \n\nThe calculation is straightforward: \n1. New weekly earnings: $20 * 40 = $800\n2. Old weekly earnings: $16 * 25 = $400\n3. Weekly difference: $800 - $400 = $400\n4. Yearly difference: $400 * 52 = $20,800\n\nThis method directly calculates the total increase in annual income by comparing total weekly earnings and extending it to a full year.",
