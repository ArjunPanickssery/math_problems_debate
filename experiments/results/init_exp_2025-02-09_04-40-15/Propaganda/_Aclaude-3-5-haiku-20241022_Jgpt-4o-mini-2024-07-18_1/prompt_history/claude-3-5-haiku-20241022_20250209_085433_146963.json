Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for Answer A (16 baby plants):\n\nThe calculation for 16 baby plants is straightforward and logical. Each year, the spider plant produces 2 baby plants twice, which means 4 baby plants annually. Over 4 years, this consistently yields 4 * 4 = 16 total baby plants. The method is simple multiplication: 2 babies per occurrence, 2 occurrences per year, 4 years total. This approach provides a clear, linear progression without introducing unnecessary complexity. The calculation follows a direct, predictable pattern of plant reproduction, making 16 the most mathematically sound answer. The consistent rate of production means each year contributes an equal number of baby plants to the total.",
