Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for Answer A (8.0):\n\nThe problem requires calculating the total box base area and the block's area. The shoebox base is 4 \u00d7 6 = 24 square inches, and the block is 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 square inches. By directly subtracting the block's area from the box's base area, we get 24 - 16 = 8 square inches uncovered. This calculation is straightforward and uses simple multiplication and subtraction. The method follows a clear, logical approach of comparing total available space to the space occupied by the block, revealing exactly how much area remains uncovered. The arithmetic is precise and leaves no ambiguity about the remaining uncovered area.",
