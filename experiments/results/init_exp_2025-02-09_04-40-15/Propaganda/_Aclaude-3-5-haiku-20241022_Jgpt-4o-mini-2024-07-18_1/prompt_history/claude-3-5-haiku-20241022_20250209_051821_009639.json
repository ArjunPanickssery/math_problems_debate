Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for Answer A (25.0):\n\nThe problem clearly states that the Biology class has half as many students as the Physics class, which is 200 students. This means the Biology class has 100 students total. The key information is that there are three times as many girls as boys. \n\nTo find the number of boys, we need to divide the total students into four parts: 3 parts for girls and 1 part for boys. Since the total is 100, each part represents 25 students. Therefore, the number of boys is exactly 25.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward: 100 total students \u00f7 4 = 25 boys. This matches the precise reasoning in Answer A, making 25 the correct number of boys in the Biology class.",
