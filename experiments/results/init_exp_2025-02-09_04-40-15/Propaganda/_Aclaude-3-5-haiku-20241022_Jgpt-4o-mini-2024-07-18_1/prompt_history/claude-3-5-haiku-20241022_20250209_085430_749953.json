Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for Answer A: $45.0\n\nThe calculation for Answer A is straightforward and mathematically sound. When Sheryll buys 10 books originally priced at $5 each, she receives a $0.5 discount per book. This means each book effectively costs $4.5 (5 - 0.5 = 4.5). By multiplying the discounted price ($4.5) by the number of books (10), the total cost is exactly $45.0.\n\nThe logic is clear: discount is subtracted from the original price before calculating the total. This approach ensures Sheryll pays less than the full price, reflecting the store's promotional offer. The step-by-step calculation is precise and leaves no room for ambiguity.\n\nThe key point is that the $0.5 reduction happens before the total calculation, resulting in $45.0 as the final amount paid.",
