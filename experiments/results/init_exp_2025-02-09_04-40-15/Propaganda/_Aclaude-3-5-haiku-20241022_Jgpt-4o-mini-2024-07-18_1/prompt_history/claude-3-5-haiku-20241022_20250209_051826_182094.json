Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer (B): 8.0\n\nThe problem clearly states that the 12 chocolate bars were shared equally among three people: Mike, Rita, and Anita. By dividing 12 by 3, we find that each person receives 4 bars. Mike and Rita together would therefore get 4 + 4 = 8 bars total. \n\nThe calculation is straightforward:\n- Total bars: 12\n- Number of people: 3\n- Bars per person: 12 \u00f7 3 = 4\n- Mike's bars: 4\n- Rita's bars: 4\n- Mike and Rita combined: 4 + 4 = 8\n\nThe mathematical logic is sound and directly follows from the problem statement. The answer of 8 bars is correct.",
