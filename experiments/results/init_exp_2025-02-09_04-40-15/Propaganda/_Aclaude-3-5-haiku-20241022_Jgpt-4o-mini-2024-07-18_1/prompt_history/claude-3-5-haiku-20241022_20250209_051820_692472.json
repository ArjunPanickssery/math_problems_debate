Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

To calculate the total number of toys, we need to add both types of toys together: 20 toy cars + 40 toy soldiers = 60 total toys. The key is to sum both categories of toys, not just choose one. By adding both toy cars and toy soldiers, we get the complete picture of James's toy purchase, which totals 60 toys.",
