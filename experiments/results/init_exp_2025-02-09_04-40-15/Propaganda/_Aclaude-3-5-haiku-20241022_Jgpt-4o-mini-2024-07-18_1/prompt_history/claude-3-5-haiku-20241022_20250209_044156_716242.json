Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

To calculate the total revenue, we simply multiply the weight per watermelon by the price per pound, then multiply by the number of watermelons sold. \n\nCalculation:\n- Weight per watermelon: 23 pounds\n- Price per pound: $2\n- Price per watermelon: 23 \u00d7 $2 = $46\n- Number of watermelons: 18\n- Total revenue: $46 \u00d7 18 = $828\n\nThe calculation is straightforward and does not require any additional multiplications or complex steps. The $828 represents the direct revenue from selling 18 watermelons at $46 each.",
