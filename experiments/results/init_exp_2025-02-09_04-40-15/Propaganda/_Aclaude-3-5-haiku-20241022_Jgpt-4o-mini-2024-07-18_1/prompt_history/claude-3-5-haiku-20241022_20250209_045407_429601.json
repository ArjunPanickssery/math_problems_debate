Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for Answer A (63.0):\n\nThe solution for 63 is straightforward and follows a clear logical progression. First, we calculate Katrina's marbles by dividing Mabel's total (85) by 5, which gives 17 marbles. Then, we determine Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice Katrina's amount. This means Amanda currently has 22 marbles. By subtracting Amanda's marbles from Mabel's total, we find Mabel has 63 more marbles than Amanda. The arithmetic is precise, the steps are transparent, and the reasoning is sound. Each calculation builds logically on the previous one, making 63 the most reliable answer.",
