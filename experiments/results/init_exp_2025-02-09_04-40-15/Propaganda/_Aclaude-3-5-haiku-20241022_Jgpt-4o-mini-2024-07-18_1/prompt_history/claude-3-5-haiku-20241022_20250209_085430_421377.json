Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for Answer A (6.0):\n\nThe calculation clearly shows that the total length of the CDs is 6 hours. Let's break it down systematically:\n\n1. Two shorter CDs are 1.5 hours each\n   1.5 \u00d7 2 = 3 hours for these two CDs\n\n2. The long CD is twice the length of the shorter CDs\n   1.5 \u00d7 2 = 3 hours for the long CD\n\n3. Total length of all CDs\n   3 hours (short CDs) + 3 hours (long CD) = 6 hours\n\nThe problem statement is straightforward, and the math is precise. Each step follows logically from the previous one, demonstrating that the total length is definitively 6 hours. The calculation is clear, direct, and matches the original problem description exactly.",
