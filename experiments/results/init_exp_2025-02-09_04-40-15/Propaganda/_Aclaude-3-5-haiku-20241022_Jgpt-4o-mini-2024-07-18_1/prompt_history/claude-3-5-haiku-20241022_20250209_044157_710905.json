Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for Answer A: 828.0\n\nFarmer Kent's watermelons weigh 23 pounds each, and he sells them at $2 per pound. To calculate the total revenue, we first determine the price of a single watermelon: $2 \u00d7 23 = $46. Then, to find the total earnings for 18 watermelons, we multiply $46 by 18, which gives us $828. \n\nThe calculation is straightforward: \n1. Price per pound: $2\n2. Weight of each watermelon: 23 pounds\n3. Price per watermelon: $2 \u00d7 23 = $46\n4. Total for 18 watermelons: $46 \u00d7 18 = $828\n\nThe math is clear and direct, with no need for additional complexity or multiplication by two. The answer is simply $828.",
