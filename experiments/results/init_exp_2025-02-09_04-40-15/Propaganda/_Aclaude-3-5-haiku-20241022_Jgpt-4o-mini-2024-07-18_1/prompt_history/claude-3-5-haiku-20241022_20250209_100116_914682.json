Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for Answer (B): 3.0 bags of chips.\n\nThe problem clearly states that John eats a bag of chips for dinner, and then eats TWICE AS MANY after dinner. This means after his dinner bag, he consumes two more bags. So the calculation is:\n- 1 bag during dinner\n- 2 bags after dinner (twice as many as during dinner)\n- Total: 1 + 2 = 3 bags\n\nThe key phrase \"twice as many\" means multiplying the initial amount by 2, which results in 2 additional bags. When we add this to the original dinner bag, we get 3 bags total. The mathematical logic is sound, and the wording of the problem supports this interpretation precisely.",
