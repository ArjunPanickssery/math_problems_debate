          "content": "I will argue for Answer (B): 277.0\n\nMr. Curtis has a total of 325 chickens, with 28 roosters. This means he has 297 hens (325 - 28 = 297). Out of these 297 hens, 20 do not lay eggs. Therefore, the number of egg-laying hens is 277 (297 - 20 = 277). \n\nThe calculation is straightforward: total chickens minus roosters gives the number of hens, and then subtracting the non-laying hens provides the precise count of egg-laying hens. This method ensures an accurate count by systematically removing non-productive chickens from the total herd. The mathematical logic is clear and precise, leading to the answer of 277 egg-laying hens.",
