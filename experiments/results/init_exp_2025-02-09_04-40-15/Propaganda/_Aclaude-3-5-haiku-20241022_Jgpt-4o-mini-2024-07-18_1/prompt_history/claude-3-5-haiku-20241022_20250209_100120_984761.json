Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for Answer A: $3.0\n\nMy argument focuses on precise calculation and clear reasoning:\n\nLee and his friend brought $18 total to the restaurant. They purchased chicken wings for $6, a chicken salad for $4, and two sodas at $1 each, totaling $12 in food. When the $3 tax is added, the total bill becomes $15. Subtracting $15 from their original $18 leaves exactly $3 in change. \n\nThe calculations are straightforward: \n1. Total money: $10 + $8 = $18\n2. Food cost: $6 + $4 + $1 + $1 = $12\n3. Total with tax: $12 + $3 = $15\n4. Change: $18 - $15 = $3\n\nThis methodical breakdown demonstrates why $3 is the correct change amount.",
