Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for Answer (B): 65.0\n\nThe calculation is straightforward: On Wednesday, 37 students played kickball. On Thursday, 9 fewer students played, which means 28 students (37 - 9 = 28) participated. When we add the number of students from both days, we get 37 + 28 = 65 students total. \n\nThe key point is understanding \"9 fewer students\" means subtraction, not addition. This means the Thursday group is smaller than Wednesday's group. The problem asks for the total number of students across both days, which is precisely 65. The arithmetic is clear and direct, making 65 the correct answer.",
