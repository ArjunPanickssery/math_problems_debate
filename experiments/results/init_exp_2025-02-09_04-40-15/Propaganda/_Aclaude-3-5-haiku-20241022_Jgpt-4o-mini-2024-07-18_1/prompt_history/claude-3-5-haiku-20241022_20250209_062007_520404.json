Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for Answer B: 204.0\n\nIsabel's money journey follows a clear mathematical pattern. She first spends half her money on a toy, leaving her with half her original amount. Then she spends half of that remaining money on a book, which leaves her with $51.\n\nLet's work backwards systematically:\n1. After buying the book, she has $51\n2. Before buying the book, she must have had $102 (since she spent half)\n3. Before buying the toy, she must have had $204 (since she spent half)\n\nThe key steps are doubling the current amount to find the previous amount. Starting from $51 and doubling twice gets us to $204. This matches the problem's description perfectly.\n\nThe solution of 204 is straightforward, logical, and directly follows the problem's stated spending pattern. 408 requires an extra, unsupported doubling step that doesn't align with the original scenario.",
