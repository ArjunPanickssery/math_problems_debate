Stu has 9 books, so Albert must have 4 * 9 = 36 books. When we add Stu's 9 books to Albert's 36 books, the total is precisely 45 books. The calculation is straightforward multiplication and addition. The key is understanding the phrase \"4 times as many\" means multiplying Stu's book count by 4, which yields 36, and then adding Stu's original 9 books to get the total of 45. The alternative answer of 22 incorrectly interprets the multiplication relationship between Stu's and Albert's book collections.\n\n\nBased on the information and arguments above, give a probability between 0 and 1 that you think answer B is correct.\n\nYou must give your answer in the form\n\n{'prob': (some float between 0 and 1)}"
