Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question states that Wyatt has 10 blue envelopes and 4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue envelopes. To determine the total number of envelopes Wyatt has, I need to:\n\n1. Calculate the number of yellow envelopes by subtracting 4 from the number of blue envelopes (10)\n2. Add the number of blue envelopes and yellow envelopes together to get the total\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The required \"expr\" parameter can be inferred from the question text.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of yellow envelopes with:\n10 - 4\n\nThen I'll add that result to the number of blue envelopes:\n10 + [result from previous step]\n\n</thinking>",
