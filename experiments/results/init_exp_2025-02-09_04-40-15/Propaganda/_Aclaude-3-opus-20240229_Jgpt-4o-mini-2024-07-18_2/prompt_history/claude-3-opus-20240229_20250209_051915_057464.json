Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

To argue that this is correct, I will:\n\n1. Set up an equation letting x represent the number of roosters. The number of hens will be 9x - 5.\n2. The total number of chickens is the number of roosters plus the number of hens. Set this equal to 75.\n3. Solve the equation for x to determine the number of roosters. \n4. Plug the number of roosters into the expression 9x - 5 to calculate the number of hens.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful in solving the equation in step 3. All the information needed is provided in the question.\n</thinking>",
