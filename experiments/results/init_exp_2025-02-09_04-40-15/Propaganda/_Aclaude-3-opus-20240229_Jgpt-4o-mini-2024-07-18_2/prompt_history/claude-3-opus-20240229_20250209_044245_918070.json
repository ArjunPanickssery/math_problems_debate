Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

The key information provided is:\n\n- Jace drives 60 miles per hour\n- He drives for 4 hours straight, takes a 30 minute break, then drives another 9 hours straight\n\nTo calculate the total distance, we need to:\n1. Determine the total driving time (the break time does not count towards distance traveled)\n2. Multiply the total driving time by the speed to get total distance\n\nThe total driving time is 4 hours + 9 hours = 13 hours. \nWith the speed of 60 miles per hour, we can calculate the total distance as:",
