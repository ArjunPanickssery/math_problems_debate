Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

How old am I now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 17.0\nIn 2 years, my dog will be 4 years old, so my dog is 4 - 2 = 2 years old now.\nSo I am 15 + 2 = 17 years old now.\n#### 17\n(B): 19.0\nI was 15 when my dog was born. My dog will be 4 years old in 2 years.\nSo my current age is 15 + 4 = 19 years old.\n#### 19</question>\n<your_answer></your_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"
