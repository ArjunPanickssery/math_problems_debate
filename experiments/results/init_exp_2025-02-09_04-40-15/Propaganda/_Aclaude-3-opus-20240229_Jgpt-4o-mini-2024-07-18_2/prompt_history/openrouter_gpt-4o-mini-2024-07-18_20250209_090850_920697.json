If Mr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars, how many silver dollars the three have in total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 205.0\nMr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars.\nIf Mr. Phung has 16 more silver dollars than Mr. Chiu, then his total silver dollars is 56+16 = 72\nThe total number of silver dollars that Mr. Ha owns is 72 +5= 77\nCombined, together they have 77+72+56 = 205 silver dollars\n#### 205\n(B): 189.0\nMr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars.\nMr. Phung has 16 more silver dollars than Mr. Chiu, so he has 56+16 = 72 silver dollars\nMr. Ha has 5 more silver dollars, so his total is 56+5 = 61 silver dollars\nTogether they have 72+61+56 = 189 silver dollars\n#### 189\n\nPlease note that anything that is included in\n<tool_result></tool_result>\ntags is guaranteed to be true.\n\nContext: ## Argument in favour of B\n<thinking>\nThe question gives the following information:\n- Mr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars\n- Mr. Phung has 16 more silver dollars than Mr. Chiu\n- Mr. Ha owns 5 more silver dollars than Mr. Phung\nTo calculate the total number of silver dollars the three have, we need to:\n1. Calculate how many silver dollars Mr. Phung has based on Mr. Chiu's amount\n2. Calculate how many silver dollars Mr. Ha has based on Mr. Phung's amount \n3. Add up the silver dollars of all three people\nNo tools are needed, as the question can be answered with the given information and basic arithmetic.\n</thinking><tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"56 + 16\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"56 + 16\"},\n    \"result\": 72,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<thinking>\nThe question gives the following information:\n- Mr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars\n- Mr. Phung has 16 more silver dollars than Mr. Chiu\n- Mr. Ha owns 5 more silver dollars than Mr. Phung\nTo calculate the total number of silver dollars the three have, we need to:\n1.
