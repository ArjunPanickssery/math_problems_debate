Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

How many meters of ribbon are not used?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 10.0\nEach part is 30/6 = 5 meters long.\nSince Liam used 4 parts, then he used 5 x 4 = 20 meters of the ribbon.\nSo, 30 - 20 = 10 meters of ribbon is not used.\n#### 10\n(B): 15.0\nThe ribbon was cut into 6 parts, and 4 were used, leaving 2 parts unused.\nEach part is 30/4 = 7.5 meters long.\nTherefore 2 \u00d7 7.5 = 15 meters were not used.\n#### 15</question>\n<your_answer></your_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"
