Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100\n(B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25</question>\n<your_answer></your_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"

To determine how much Sandra got, I need to use the ratio and the amount Amy received to calculate Sandra's portion.\n\nThe two key pieces of information are:\n1. The ratio of money split between Sandra, Amy, and Ruth is 2:1:3 respectively\n2. Amy received $50\n\nWith this information, I can calculate how much Sandra received by using the ratio. In the ratio, Sandra's portion is represented by 2, while Amy's is 1. So Sandra should receive twice as much as Amy.\n\nSince I have the amount Amy received ($50) and know that Sandra gets twice that based on the 2:1 ratio, I can calculate Sandra's amount by multiplying Amy's $50 by 2.\n\n$50 * 2 = $100\n\nTherefore, I can determine that Sandra received $100 without needing any additional information or tools.\n</thinking>",
