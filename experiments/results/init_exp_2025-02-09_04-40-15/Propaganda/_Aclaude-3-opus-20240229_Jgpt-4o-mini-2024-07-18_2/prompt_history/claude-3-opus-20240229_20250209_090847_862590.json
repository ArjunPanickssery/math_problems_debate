Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

      "content": "<question>QUESTION: A gallon of whole milk that normally costs $3 is now sold at $2. A box of cereal was sold at a discount of $1. How much will you save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 8.0\nThe discount for each gallon of whole milk is $3 - $2 = $1.\nSo the discount for 3 gallons of whole milk is $1/gallon x 3 gallons = $3.\nThe total discount for 5 boxes of cereal is $1/box x 5 boxes = $5.\nYou will save $3 + $5 = $8 for 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal.\n#### 8\n(B): 2.0\nFor milk:\nThe discount per gallon is $2 - $3 = -$1\nFor 3 gallons: -$1 \u00d7 3 = -$3\nFor cereal:\nThe discount is $1 per box\nFor 5 boxes: $1 \u00d7 5 = $5\nTotal savings is -$3 + $5 = $2\n#### 2</question>\n<your_answer></your_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"

Add the milk and cereal discounts together\n\nThe question provides all the information needed to perform these calculations:\n- Original milk price: $3/gallon \n- Discounted milk price: $2/gallon\n- Discount per cereal box: $1/box\n- Quantity of milk: 3 gallons\n- Quantity of cereal: 5 boxes\n\nNo additional tools or information are needed.
