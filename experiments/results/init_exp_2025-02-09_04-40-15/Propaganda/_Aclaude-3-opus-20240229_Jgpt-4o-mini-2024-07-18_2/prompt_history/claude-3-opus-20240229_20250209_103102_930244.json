Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

While it doesn't explicitly say he only reads on those days, that is the most reasonable implication. \n\nSince the book is 2100 pages long, and Steve reads 100 pages per day, it will take him 2100/100 = 21 days total to finish the book.\n\nIf we assume Steve only reads on the specified days of Monday, Wednesday, and Friday each week, then over the course of 21 days, that spans across 7 weeks (since 21/3 = 7). \n\nHowever, in that final 7th week, Steve would complete the book on Wednesday, which is the 2nd day he reads that week. So even though it takes 7 weeks of elapsed time, Steve finishes the book in the 3rd week, on that Wednesday.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is that it takes Steve 3 weeks to finish the book, based on the specified reading schedule of 100 pages on 3 days per week.\n</result>",
