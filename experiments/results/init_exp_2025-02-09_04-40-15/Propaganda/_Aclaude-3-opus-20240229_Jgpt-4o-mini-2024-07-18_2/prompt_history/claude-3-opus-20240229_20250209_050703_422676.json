Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

How much does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50\n(A): 100.0\nFirst calculate what fraction remains: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\nSince 2/3 was spent, multiply $150 by 2/3: $150 * (2/3) = $100\nThis is the amount she has left.\n#### 100</question>\n<your_answer></your_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"

To determine the amount of money the housewife has left, we need to:\n1. Calculate the fraction of the original $150 that remains after spending 2/3 of it\n2. Multiply $150 by that remaining fraction to get the dollar amount left\n\nThe key steps are:\nRemaining fraction = 1 - (2/3) = 1/3\nAmount left = $150 * (1/3)\n\nWe have the $150 value given directly in the question. The 2/3 spent is also directly stated. From that we can calculate the 1/3 remaining by subtracting 2/3 from 1. \n\nSo we have all the necessary parameters to calculate the final amount using math_eval.\n</thinking>",
