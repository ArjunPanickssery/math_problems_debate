Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question provides two possible answers for how many shirts Mary has left after giving away some of her blue and brown shirts. To determine which answer to argue for, I'll evaluate each one:\n\nAnswer A: \n- Assumes Mary gives away half of her brown shirts (36/2 = 18) and a third of her blue shirts (26/3 \u2248 9)\n- This does not match the givens in the original question\n\nAnswer B:\n- Assumes Mary gives away half of her blue shirts (26/2 = 13) and a third of her brown shirts (36/3 = 12) \n- This matches the givens in the original question\n- The math to calculate the remaining shirts (13 blue + 24 brown = 37 total) is correct\n\nBased on analyzing the two possible answers, Answer B aligns with the information provided in the original question, while Answer A does not. Therefore, I will argue in favor of Answer B being the correct answer.\n</thinking>",
