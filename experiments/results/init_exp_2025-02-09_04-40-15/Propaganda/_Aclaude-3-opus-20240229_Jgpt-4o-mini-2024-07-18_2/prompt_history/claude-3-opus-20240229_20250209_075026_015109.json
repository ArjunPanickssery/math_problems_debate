Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

If Lydia planted a tree when she was 4 years old and is now 9 years old, how old would she be when she gets to eat an apple from her tree for the first time?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 11.0\nThe tree has been planted for 9 - 4 = 5 years\nIt will take another 7 - 5 = 2 years for it to bear fruit\nLydia will be 9 + 2 = 11 years old\n#### 11\n(B): 16.0\nStarting from her current age of 9\nIt takes 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit\nHer age will be 9 + 7 = 16 when she can eat the apples\n#### 16</question>\n<your_answer></your_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"

How long the tree has already been planted (current age - age when planted)\n2. Additional years needed for the tree to bear fruit (7 years total - years already planted) \n3. Lydia's age when tree bears fruit (current age + additional years needed)\nThe key steps are calculating the years the tree has been planted so far, and then adding the remaining years needed to Lydia's current age.\nNo tools are needed since the question provides all the necessary information and only requires basic arithmetic.\n</thinking>",
