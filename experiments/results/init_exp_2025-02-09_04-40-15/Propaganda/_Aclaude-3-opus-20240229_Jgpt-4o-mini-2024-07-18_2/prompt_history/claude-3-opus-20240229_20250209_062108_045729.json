Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

Here's why:\n\nCarol sold a total of $960 worth of tickets over the 3 day period. Since each ticket costs $4, we can calculate the total number of tickets sold by dividing the total revenue by the ticket price:\n\n960 / 4 = 240 \n\nSo 240 total tickets were sold over the 3 days.\n\nTo get the average per day, we simply divide the total tickets by the number of days:\n\n240 / 3 = 80\n\nTherefore, Carol sold an average of 80 tickets per day during this 3 day period.
