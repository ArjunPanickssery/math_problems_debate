Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

How many apples did Sara eat?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 16.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: A = 4S\nWhich means: 4S + S = 80\nSo: 5S = 80\nSo the number of apples Sara ate is: S = 80 / 5= 16 apples\n#### 16\n(A): 64.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: S = 4A\nWhich means: A + 4A = 80\nSo: 5A = 80\nTherefore: A = 16\nAnd finally: S = 4A = 4 \u00d7 16 = 64 apples\n#### 64</question>\n<your_answer></your_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"

Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara\nTo determine how many apples Sara ate, we need to set up an equation based on these facts.\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nA + S = 80 (total apples eaten)\nA = 4S (Ali ate 4 times more than Sara)\nSubstituting the second equation into the first:\n4S + S = 80\n5S = 80\nS = 80/5 = 16\nSo Sara ate 16 apples.\nThe math_eval tool is not needed here since the equation can be solved with simple algebra.
