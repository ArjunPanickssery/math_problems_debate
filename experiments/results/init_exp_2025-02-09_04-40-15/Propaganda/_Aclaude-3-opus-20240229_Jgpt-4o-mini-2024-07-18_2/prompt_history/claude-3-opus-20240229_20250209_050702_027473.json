Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question asks how many yellow crayons there are, given the number of red and blue crayons and a relationship between the number of blue and yellow crayons.\n\nTo determine the number of yellow crayons, we first need to calculate the number of blue crayons. The question states there are 5 more blue crayons than red crayons. Since the number of red crayons is given as 14, we can calculate the number of blue crayons by adding 5 to 14.\n\nOnce we have the number of blue crayons, the question states the number of yellow crayons is 6 less than double the blue crayons. To get this, we need to:\n1. Double the number of blue crayons \n2. Subtract 6 from that doubled amount\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The required \"expr\" parameter can be inferred from the question text.\n</thinking>",
