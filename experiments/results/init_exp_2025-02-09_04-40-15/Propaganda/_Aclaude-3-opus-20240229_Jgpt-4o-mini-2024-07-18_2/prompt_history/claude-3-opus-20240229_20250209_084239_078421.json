Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

Here's why:\n\nDarla has 6 books. The question states Katie has half as many books as Darla. Half of 6 is 3, so Katie has 3 books. \n\nGary has 5 times the number of books that Darla and Katie have combined. Darla and Katie together have 6 + 3 = 9 books. 5 times 9 is 45, so Gary has 45 books.\n\nTo get the total, we add up the number of books each person has:\nDarla: 6\nKatie: 3 \nGary: 45\n6 + 3 + 45 = 54\n\nTherefore, the three have a total of 54 books, which matches answer (A).\n</your_answer>",
