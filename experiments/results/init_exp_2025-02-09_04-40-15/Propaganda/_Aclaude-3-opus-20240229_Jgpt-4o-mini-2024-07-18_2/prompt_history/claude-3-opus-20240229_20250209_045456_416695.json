Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question asks how long Kate's hair is in inches. To determine this, we need to know the length of Emily's hair, since Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's.\n\nWe are given that Emily's hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's, and Logan's hair is 20 inches. So to calculate Emily's hair length, we can use the math_eval tool to add 6 to 20.\n\nOnce we have Emily's hair length, we can calculate Kate's by dividing Emily's length by 2, since Kate's is half as long. The math_eval tool can also handle this division.\n\nSo the steps are:\n1. Use math_eval to calculate Emily's hair length by adding 6 to Logan's 20 inch length \n2. Use math_eval to divide the result from step 1 by 2 to get Kate's hair length\n</thinking>",
