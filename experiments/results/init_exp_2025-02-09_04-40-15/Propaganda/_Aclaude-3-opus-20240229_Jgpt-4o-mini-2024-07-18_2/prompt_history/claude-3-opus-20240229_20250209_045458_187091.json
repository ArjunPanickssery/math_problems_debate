Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

This would require calculating a weighted average of his win rates in the first 100 and second 100 matches.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful for calculating the weighted average to show the overall 60% win rate. The parameters I would need are:\nexpr: The mathematical expression to calculate the weighted average win rate\n</thinking>",
