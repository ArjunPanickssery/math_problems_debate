Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

How many tickets on average did she sell during one of these three days?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 80.0\nCarol sold 960 / 4 = 240 tickets during three days.\nSo in one day, she sold on average 240 / 3 = 80 tickets.\n#### 80\n(A): 1280\nFirst divide the total money by days to get daily revenue\n$960 / 3 = $320 per day\nThen since each ticket is $4, that means she sold 320 \u00d7 4 = 1280 tickets per day\n#### 1280</question>\n<your_answer></your_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"

It provides the total revenue from ticket sales ($960) and the cost per ticket ($4).\n\nTo calculate the average tickets sold per day, we need to:\n1. Calculate the total number of tickets sold by dividing the total revenue by the ticket price. This can be done with the math_eval tool.\n2. Divide the total tickets sold by the number of days (3) to get the average per day. The math_eval tool can also handle this.\n\nAll the necessary information is provided in the question, so no additional tools or clarification from the user is needed. We can proceed with using the math_eval tool to calculate the result.\n</thinking>",
