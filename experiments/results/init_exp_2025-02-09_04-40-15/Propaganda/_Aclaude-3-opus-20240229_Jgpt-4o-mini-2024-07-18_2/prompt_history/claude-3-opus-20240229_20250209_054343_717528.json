Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

      "content": "<question>QUESTION: A piece of wire 5 feet 4 inches long was divided into 4 equal parts. How long was each part in inches if 1 foot is equal to 12 inches?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 16.0\nFive feet is equal to 5 feet x 12 inches/foot = 60 inches.\nSo, the total length of the wire was 60 inches + 4 inches = 64 inches.\nHence, each part is 64 inches / 4 parts = 16 inches/part.\n#### 16\n(A): 16.2\nConvert the length to decimal feet: 5 feet 4 inches = 5.4 feet\nConvert to inches by multiplying by 12: 5.4 \u00d7 12 = 64.8 inches\nDivide by 4 parts: 64.8 \u00f7 4 = 16.2 inches\n#### 16.2</question>\n<your_answer></your_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"

Looking at the information provided:\n- The wire is 5 feet 4 inches long total\n- 1 foot = 12 inches\n- The wire is divided into 4 equal parts\n\nTo calculate the length of each part in inches:\n1. Convert the total length fully to inches \n   - 5 feet = 5 * 12 = 60 inches\n   - Total length = 60 inches + 4 inches = 64 inches\n2. Divide the total inches by 4 to get the length of each part\n   - Each part = 64 / 4 = 16 inches\n\nSo the math_eval expression should be:\n(5 * 12 + 4) / 4\n\nThis will give us the length of each part in inches.\n</thinking>",
