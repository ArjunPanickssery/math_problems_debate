Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

The squat rack cost $2500 and the barbell cost 1/10 as much as the squat rack.\n\nTo calculate the total, we need to:\n1. Find the cost of the barbell by dividing the squat rack cost by 10\n2. Add the squat rack cost and barbell cost together\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The required \"expr\" parameter can be inferred from the question text.\n\nSo the plan is to make two calls to math_eval:\n1. To calculate the barbell cost as 2500/10\n2. To add the squat rack cost (2500) and barbell cost from step 1\n</thinking>",
