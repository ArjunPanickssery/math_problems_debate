Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

How many total toys does he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nHe buys 2*20=40 toy cars\nSo the total number of toys is 20+40=60\n#### 60\n(A): 40.0\nHe buys twice as many toy soldiers as cars\nThis means he buys 2*20=40 toy soldiers\nThis is the total number of toys\n#### 40</question>\n<your_answer></your_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"
