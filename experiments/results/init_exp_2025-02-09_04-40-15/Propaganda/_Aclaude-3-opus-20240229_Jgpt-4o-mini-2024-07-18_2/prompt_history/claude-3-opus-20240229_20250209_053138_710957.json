Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

I have been assigned answer (A), so I will argue that $108 is the right answer.\n</thinking>\n\n<your_answer>The correct answer is (A), that Carl spent a total of $108 on index cards. Here's why:\n\nCarl has 30 students in each of his 6 classes. So in total he has 30 * 6 = 180 students. \nHe wants to give each student 10 index cards. Therefore, the total number of index cards he needs is 180 students * 10 cards each = 1800 cards.\n\nIndex cards are sold in packs of 50 for $3 each. To calculate how many packs Carl needs to buy, we take the total cards needed and divide by the number of cards per pack:",
