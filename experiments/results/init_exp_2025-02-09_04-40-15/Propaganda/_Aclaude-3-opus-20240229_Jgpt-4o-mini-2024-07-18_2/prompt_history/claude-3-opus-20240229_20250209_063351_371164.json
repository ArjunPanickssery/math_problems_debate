          "content": "The correct answer is 12 packs. The question states that John buys 2 packs for each of his classes, and he has 6 classes total. So to calculate the total packs, we simply need to multiply the number of classes (6) by the packs per class (2). This gives us 6 * 2 = 12 packs total.\n\nThe phrasing \"for all his students\" could be interpreted to mean the packs are distributed to the individual students. However, a more reasonable interpretation is that \"for all his students\" simply means the packs are for use by his students in general, not necessarily that each individual student gets 2 packs. \n\nIt's much more likely that the packs would be bought and distributed on a per-class basis rather than per-student. Logistically, it would be very inefficient to buy separate packs for every individual student. It makes more sense to just buy a couple packs per class for the students in that class to share.\n\nSo in summary, the most reasonable interpretation of the question is that the packs are bought per class, not per student, leading to an answer of 12 total packs, calculated as 6 classes * 2 packs per class. The alternative interpretation that yields 360 packs is possible based on the phrasing, but is an unlikely scenario in practice.",
