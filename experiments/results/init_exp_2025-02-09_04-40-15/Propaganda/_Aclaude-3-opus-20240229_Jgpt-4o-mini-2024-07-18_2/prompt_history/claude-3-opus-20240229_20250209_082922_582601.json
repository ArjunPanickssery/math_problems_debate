Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

If the Biology class has half as many students as the Physics class, how many boys are in the Biology class?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 25.0\nThe Biology class has 200/2=100 students.\nThe boys in the Biology class are 1/4*100=25 students.\n#### 25\n(B): 33.33\nThe Biology class has 200/2=100 students.\nSince there are three times as many girls, divide total by 3 to get boys: 100/3\u224833.33\n#### 33.33</question>\n<your_answer></your_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"

Use the total number of students and the ratio to calculate the number of boys\n\nThe question provides the following relevant information:\n- There are three times as many girls as boys in the Biology class\n- The Physics class has 200 students\n- The Biology class has half as many students as the Physics class\n\nWith this information, we can calculate the total number of students in the Biology class by dividing the number of students in the Physics class by 2.\n\nTo determine the number of boys, we can use the ratio that there are three times as many girls as boys. If we let x represent the number of boys, then the number of girls would be 3x. The total number of students in the class would be x + 3x = 4x. \n\nKnowing the total number of students and the ratio, we can set up an equation to solve for x, which represents the number of boys in the class.\n\nThe provided tool for evaluating mathematical expressions could be helpful in solving this equation.\n</thinking>",
