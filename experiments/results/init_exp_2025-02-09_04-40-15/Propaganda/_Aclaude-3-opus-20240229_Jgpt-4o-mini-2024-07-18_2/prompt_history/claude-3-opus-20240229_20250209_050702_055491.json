Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

The key information provided is:\n- Mr. Curtis has 325 total chickens\n- 28 of the chickens are roosters\n- The rest of the chickens are hens\n- 20 of the hens do not lay eggs\n- The remaining hens do lay eggs\n\nTo calculate the number of egg-laying hens, we need to:\n1. Calculate the total number of hens by subtracting the number of roosters from the total number of chickens\n2. Subtract the number of non-egg-laying hens from the total number of hens\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The required \"expr\" parameter can be inferred from the information provided.\n</thinking>",
