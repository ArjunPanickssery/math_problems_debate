Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

The question states the farm has \"5 less than 9 times the amount of hens as roosters.\" This can be interpreted to mean the number of hens is 5 more than 9 times the number of roosters. Let x be the number of roosters. Then the number of hens is 9x+5. The total number of chickens is the sum of hens and roosters: 9x+5+x=75. Solving this equation: \n10x+5=75\n10x=70\nx=7\nThere are 7 roosters. Plugging this back into the equation for hens:\nNumber of hens = 9(7)+5 = 68\nTherefore, the farm has 68 hens, so answer choice (B) is correct.",
