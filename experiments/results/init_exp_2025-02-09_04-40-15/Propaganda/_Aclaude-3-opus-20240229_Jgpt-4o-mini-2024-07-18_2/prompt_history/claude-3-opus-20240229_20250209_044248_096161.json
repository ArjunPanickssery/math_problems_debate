Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "<thinking>\nTo determine how long it will take Celia to run 30 miles, we need to know:\n1. How long it takes Lexie to run 1 mile (given as 20 minutes)\n2. How much faster Celia runs compared to Lexie (given as twice as fast)\n3. The number of miles Celia needs to run (given as 30 miles)\n\nWe can calculate Celia's time to run 1 mile by dividing Lexie's time by 2, since Celia is twice as fast.\n\nCelia's 1 mile time = Lexie's 1 mile time / 2\n                    = 20 minutes / 2\n                    = 10 minutes\n\nThen to get Celia's time for 30 miles, we multiply her 1 mile time by 30.\n\nCelia's 30 mile time = Celia's 1 mile time * 30\n                     = 10 minutes * 30\n                     = 300 minutes\n\nSo the correct answer is (B) 300 minutes. No tools are needed since the calculation is straightforward.\n</thinking>",
