Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

How many gallons of water did they drink altogether?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 2.0\nThe traveler\u2019s camel drank 7 * 32 = 224 ounces of water.\nTogether, the traveler and his camel drank 32 + 224 = 256 ounces.\nThus, they drank 256 / 128 = 2 gallons of water altogether.\n#### 2\n(A): 2.75\nThe traveler drank 32 ounces, which equals 32/128 = 0.25 gallons\nThe camel drank seven times this amount: 0.25 * 7 = 1.75 gallons\nTotal water consumed: 0.25 + 1.75 = 2.75 gallons\n#### 2.75</question>\n<your_answer></your_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"
