Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

Here's why:\n\nWe know Isabel ended up with $51 after buying the toy and book. To figure out how much she started with, we need to work backwards, doubling the amount at each step.\n\nAfter buying the book, she had $51 left. Before buying the book, she must have had double that, or $102. \n\nBefore buying the toy, she had double the $102, which is $204.\n\nAnd initially, before buying anything, she had double the $204, which comes out to $408.\n\nSo following the problem description, Isabel had to have started with $408 in her piggy bank, then spent half ($204) on the toy, half of what was left ($102) on the book, leaving her with the final $51 stated in the question. The math clearly leads to $408 as the initial amount.\n</your_answer>",
