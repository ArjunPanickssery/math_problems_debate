Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question is asking how many total flowers Maria will have after buying 3 dozen flowers, given that for every dozen bought, she gets 2 free flowers.\n\nTo calculate the total number of flowers, we need to:\n1. Calculate the number of flowers in 3 dozen (3 x 12)\n2. Calculate the number of free flowers for buying 3 dozen (3 x 2)\n3. Add the results of steps 1 and 2 together\n\nBoth answers correctly calculate steps 1 and 2, getting 36 regular flowers and 6 free flowers. However, answer B then adds an extra 2 free flowers on top of that, which is incorrect. The problem states that Maria gets 2 free flowers for each dozen bought, not an additional 2 flowers on top of that for the total purchase.\n\nTherefore, answer A is correct and answer B is incorrect. To argue for answer A being correct, I would point out that it follows the problem statement exactly - calculating the regular flowers, the free flowers per dozen, and adding those together to get the total. No extra free flowers beyond the 2 per dozen are mentioned in the question.\n</thinking>\n\n<argument>\nAnswer A is correct. The problem states that Maria gets 2 free flowers for each dozen bought. Answer A correctly calculates this by first determining the number of flowers in 3 dozen (3 x 12 = 36), then adding the 2 free flowers per dozen (3 x 2 = 6), to get a total of 42 flowers. \n\nThe key is that Maria gets 2 free flowers per dozen. She does not get any additional free flowers beyond that for her total purchase. Answer B incorrectly adds an extra 2 free flowers on top of the 2 per dozen, which is not stated anywhere in the problem. By strictly following what is given in the question, we can determine that answer A arrives at the correct total of 42 flowers for buying 3 dozen.\n</argument>",
