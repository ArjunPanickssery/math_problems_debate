Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

How far does he move horizontally, in feet?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2700.0\nHe travels 1450-100=1350 feet vertically\nSo he travels 1350*2=2700 feet horizontally\n#### 2700\n(B): 2900.0\nHe reaches an elevation of 1450 feet\nSince he moves 2 feet horizontally for each vertical foot, he travels 1450*2=2900 feet horizontally\n#### 2900</question>\n<your_answer></your_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"

Find the change in elevation (vertical distance)\n2. Multiply the vertical distance by 2 to get the horizontal distance, since he moves 2 feet horizontally for every 1 foot vertically\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The required parameter is the mathematical expression to evaluate.\n\nTo find the change in elevation, we can use:\n1450 - 100\n\nTo get the horizontal distance, we can multiply the change in elevation by 2.\n\nSo the full expression would be:\n(1450 - 100) * 2\n\nThis uses the information provided in the question and should give the horizontal distance traveled.
