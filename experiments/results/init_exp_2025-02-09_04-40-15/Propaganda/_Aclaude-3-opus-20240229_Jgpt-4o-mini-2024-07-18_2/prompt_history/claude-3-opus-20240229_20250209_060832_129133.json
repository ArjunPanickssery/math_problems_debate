Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

The question clearly states that \"It takes 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit.\" We are also told that Lydia is currently 9 years old. Therefore, to determine her age when the tree bears fruit, we simply need to add 7 years to her current age of 9. Doing this math, 9 + 7 = 16, confirms that Lydia will be 16 years old when she can finally eat an apple from the tree she planted.\n</result>",
