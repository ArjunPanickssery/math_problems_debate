Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 8.0. The question asks for the area of the shoebox that remains uncovered after placing the square block inside. The shoebox has an area of 24 square inches (4 inches tall \u00d7 6 inches wide), and the square block has an area of 16 square inches (4 inches \u00d7 4 inches). Subtracting the area of the block from the area of the shoebox gives 8 square inches of uncovered space. This calculation is straightforward and directly addresses the question. Answer (B) incorrectly uses perimeter instead of area, which is irrelevant to determining uncovered space.",
