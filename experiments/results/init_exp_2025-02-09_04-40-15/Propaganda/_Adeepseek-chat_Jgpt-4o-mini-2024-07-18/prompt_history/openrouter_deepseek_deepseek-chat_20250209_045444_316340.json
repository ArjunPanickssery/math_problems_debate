Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 6.0. James buys three CDs: two are 1.5 hours each, and the third is twice as long, which is 3 hours. To find the combined length, you add the durations: 1.5 + 1.5 + 3 = 6 hours. Answer (B) incorrectly adds only one of the shorter CDs (1.5 hours) to the longer CD (3 hours), resulting in 4.5 hours, which is incorrect. The question asks for the total length of all three CDs, not just two. Therefore, the correct combined length is 6 hours.",
