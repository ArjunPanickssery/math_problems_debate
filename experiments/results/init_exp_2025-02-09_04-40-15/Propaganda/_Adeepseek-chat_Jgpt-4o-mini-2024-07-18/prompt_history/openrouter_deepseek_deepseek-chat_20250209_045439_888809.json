Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (B): 16.0. The question states that Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara, which translates to the equation A = 4S. Substituting this into the total apples equation A + S = 80 gives 4S + S = 80, leading to 5S = 80. Solving for S, we find S = 16. This interpretation aligns with the standard understanding of \"times more,\" where Ali's consumption is directly proportional to Sara's. The alternative interpretation in (A) incorrectly assumes Sara ate 4 times more than Ali, which contradicts the question's wording. Thus, Sara ate 16 apples.",
