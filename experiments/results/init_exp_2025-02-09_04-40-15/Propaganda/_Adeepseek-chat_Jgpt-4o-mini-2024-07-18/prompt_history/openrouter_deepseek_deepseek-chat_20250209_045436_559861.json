Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (B): 20800.0. The calculation is straightforward: Jame\u2019s new weekly earnings are $20 * 40 = $800, while his old weekly earnings were $16 * 25 = $400. The difference per week is $800 - $400 = $400. Over 52 weeks, this amounts to $400 * 52 = $20,800. This method accurately reflects the total annual increase in Jame\u2019s earnings by considering both the hourly raise and the increased hours worked. Answer (A) incorrectly focuses only on the hourly raise and ignores the additional hours, leading to an underestimation of the total increase.",
