Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 12.0. The question states that John buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students, but the key detail is that he has 6 classes. The number of students per class is irrelevant because the packs are bought per class, not per student. Therefore, the calculation is straightforward: 6 classes multiplied by 2 packs per class equals 12 packs. The confusion arises from misinterpreting the question as requiring a per-student calculation, but the context clearly indicates that the packs are allocated per class.",
