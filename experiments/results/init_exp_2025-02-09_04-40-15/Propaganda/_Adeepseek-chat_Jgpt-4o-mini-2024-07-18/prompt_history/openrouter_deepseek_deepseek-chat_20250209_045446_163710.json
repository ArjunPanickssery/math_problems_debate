Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (B): 21.0. The question states that Belle eats 4 dog biscuits and 2 rawhide bones each evening. For a week (7 days), the cost of rawhide bones is calculated as 2 bones/day * $1/bone * 7 days = $14. The cost of dog biscuits is 4 biscuits/day * $0.25/biscuit * 7 days = $7. Adding these together, the total cost is $14 + $7 = $21. Answer (A) incorrectly multiplies the number of rawhide bones by 4 instead of 2 and the number of dog biscuits by 2 instead of 4, leading to an incorrect total of $31.50.",
