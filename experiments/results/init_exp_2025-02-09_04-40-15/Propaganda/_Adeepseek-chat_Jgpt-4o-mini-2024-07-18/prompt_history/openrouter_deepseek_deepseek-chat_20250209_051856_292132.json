Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (B): 44.0. The question states that twenty years ago, Shane was 2 times older than Garret is now. Garret is currently 12, so twenty years ago, Shane was 12 * 2 = 24 years old. To find Shane's current age, we simply add the 20 years that have passed since then: 24 + 20 = 44. The reasoning in (A) incorrectly adds 40 years, which is not supported by the question. The question only requires accounting for the 20-year difference once, not twice. Therefore, Shane is currently 44 years old.",
