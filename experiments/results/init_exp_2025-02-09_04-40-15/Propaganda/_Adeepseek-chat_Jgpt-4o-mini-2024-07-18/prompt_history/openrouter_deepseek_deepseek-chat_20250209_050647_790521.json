Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

She gave $250 to the cashier, so the change she received is $250 - $240 = $10. The calculations in (B) are accurate and correctly follow the problem's details. Answer (A) incorrectly swaps the prices of pants and shirts, leading to a negative change, which doesn't make sense in this context. Therefore, (B) is the correct and logical answer.",
