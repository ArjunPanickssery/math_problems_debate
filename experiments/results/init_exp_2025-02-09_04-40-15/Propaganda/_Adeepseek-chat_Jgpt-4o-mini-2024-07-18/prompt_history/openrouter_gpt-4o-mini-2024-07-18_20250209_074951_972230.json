Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu, who has 9 books. Therefore, Albert has 4 * 9 = 36 books. To find the total number of books Stu and Albert have together, we add Stu's 9 books to Albert's 36 books, resulting in 45 books. The calculation is straightforward and aligns with the question's wording, making (A) the accurate answer.\n\n\nBased on the information and arguments above, give a probability between 0 and 1 that you think answer A is correct.\n\nYou must give your answer in the form\n\n{'prob': (some float between 0 and 1)}"
