How many pieces of rope will he need to buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet\nHe loses 20*.25=5 feet each time\nSo he gets 20-5=15 feet from each piece\nThat means he needs 60/15=4 pieces of rope\n#### 4\n(A): 3.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet of rope total\nEach piece of rope is 20 feet\nTherefore he needs 60/20=3 pieces of rope\n#### 3\n\nPlease note that anything that is included in\n<tool_result></tool_result>\ntags is guaranteed to be true.\n\nContext: ## Argument in favour of B\nThe correct answer is (B): 4.0. Tom needs to lower a rope down 6 stories, which is 60 feet in total (6 stories * 10 feet per story). Each piece of rope is 20 feet long, but when lashing them together, he loses 25% of the length, which is 5 feet per piece. Therefore, each piece effectively provides 15 feet of usable rope. To achieve 60 feet, he needs 60 / 15 = 4 pieces of rope. This accounts for the loss when lashing the ropes together, ensuring he has enough length to cover the 6 stories.\n\n\nBased on the information and arguments above, give a probability between 0 and 1 that you think answer B is correct.\n\nYou must give your answer in the form\n\n{'prob': (some float between 0 and 1)}"
