Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (B): 80.0. Carol sold tickets worth $960 in total, and each ticket costs $4. To find the total number of tickets sold, divide $960 by $4, which gives 240 tickets over three days. To find the average number of tickets sold per day, divide 240 by 3, resulting in 80 tickets per day. This method correctly calculates the average by first determining the total number of tickets and then dividing by the number of days. Answer (A) incorrectly multiplies the daily revenue by the ticket price, leading to an inflated and incorrect result.",
