Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (B): 56.0. The question states that 20% of the crayons are broken, which means 20% of the total 120 crayons, not 20% of the remaining crayons after accounting for the new ones. Calculating 20% of 120 gives 24 broken crayons. Subtracting the 40 new crayons and 24 broken crayons from the total 120 leaves 56 slightly used crayons. The error in answer (A) arises from incorrectly applying the 20% to the remaining crayons after subtracting the new ones, which is not what the question specifies.",
