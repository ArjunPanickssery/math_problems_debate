Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 12.0. To determine how many more centimeters it rained on Tuesdays than Mondays, we must calculate the total rainfall for each day and then find the difference. On Mondays, it rained 1.5 cm per day for 7 days, totaling 10.5 cm. On Tuesdays, it rained 2.5 cm per day for 9 days, totaling 22.5 cm. Subtracting the total rainfall on Mondays from Tuesdays gives us 22.5 - 10.5 = 12 cm. Therefore, it rained 12 centimeters more on Tuesdays than on Mondays. This method accounts for the total rainfall difference over the entire period, making (A) the correct answer.",
