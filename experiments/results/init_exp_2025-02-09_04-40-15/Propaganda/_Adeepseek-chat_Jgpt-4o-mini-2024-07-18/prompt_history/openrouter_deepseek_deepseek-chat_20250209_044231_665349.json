Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 408.0. Let's break it down step by step. Isabel ends up with $51 after her purchases. Before buying the book, she must have had twice that amount, which is $102. This $102 is what remained after she bought the toy. Therefore, before buying the toy, she must have had twice that amount again, which is $204. Finally, to find the initial amount, we double $204, resulting in $408. This method of working backwards ensures that each step accounts for the halving of the money, leading to the correct initial amount of $408.",
