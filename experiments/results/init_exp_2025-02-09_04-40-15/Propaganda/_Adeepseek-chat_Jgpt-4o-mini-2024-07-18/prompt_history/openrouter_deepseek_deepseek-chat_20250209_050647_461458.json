Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 24.0. Wyatt has 10 blue envelopes, and the problem states he has 4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue envelopes. This means the number of yellow envelopes is calculated as 10 (blue) + 4 = 14 yellow envelopes. Adding the blue and yellow envelopes together, 10 + 14 = 24, gives the total number of envelopes Wyatt has. The interpretation that Wyatt has more yellow envelopes than blue is consistent with the phrasing \"4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue,\" implying a relative comparison that results in a higher total.",
