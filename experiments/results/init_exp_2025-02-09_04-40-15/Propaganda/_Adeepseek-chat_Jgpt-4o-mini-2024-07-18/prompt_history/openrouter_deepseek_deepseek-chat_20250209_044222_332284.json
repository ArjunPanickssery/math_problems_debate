Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 2.0. To determine the number of hours John needs to watch each day, first calculate the total viewing time: 20 episodes * 30 minutes = 600 minutes. Convert this to hours by dividing by 60: 600 / 60 = 10 hours. Finally, divide the total hours by the number of days: 10 / 5 = 2 hours per day. This straightforward calculation ensures John completes the series in 5 days. Answer (B) incorrectly converts minutes to hours by dividing by 100, leading to an erroneous result of 1.2 hours per day.",
