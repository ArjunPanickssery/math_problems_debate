Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 100.0. The ratio 2:1:3 indicates that Sandra receives 2 parts, Amy receives 1 part, and Ruth receives 3 parts. Since Amy\u2019s share is $50, which corresponds to 1 part, Sandra\u2019s share, being 2 parts, must be double that amount. Therefore, Sandra receives $100. The calculation is straightforward: 2 * $50 = $100. Answer (B) incorrectly divides Amy\u2019s amount by 2, which misinterprets the ratio and leads to an incorrect conclusion. The ratio clearly shows a multiplicative relationship, not a divisive one.",
