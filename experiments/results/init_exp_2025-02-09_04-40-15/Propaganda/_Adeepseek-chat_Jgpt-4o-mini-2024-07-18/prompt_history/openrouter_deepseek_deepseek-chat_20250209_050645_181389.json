Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

Since it takes 7 years for the tree to bear fruit, it will take an additional 2 years for the tree to produce apples. Adding these 2 years to her current age of 9, Lydia will be 11 years old when she gets to eat an apple from her tree for the first time. The calculation is straightforward: 9 + 2 = 11. Therefore, the answer is 11.0.",
