Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

This means that the remaining 60% of students achieved a grade of B or above. To find the number of students who got B and above, we calculate 60% of the total number of students, which is 60. Therefore, 60 x 60/100 = 36 students received a final grade of B and above. This calculation is straightforward and aligns with the information provided in the question.",
