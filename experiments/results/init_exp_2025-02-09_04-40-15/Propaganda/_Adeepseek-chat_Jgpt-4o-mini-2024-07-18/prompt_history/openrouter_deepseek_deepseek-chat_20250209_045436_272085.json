Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "To determine the average number of tickets Carol sold per day, we first calculate the total number of tickets sold over the three days. Since each ticket costs $4 and she sold $960 worth of tickets, the total number of tickets sold is $960 / $4 = 240 tickets. To find the average per day, we divide the total number of tickets by the number of days: 240 / 3 = 80 tickets per day. This straightforward calculation clearly shows that the correct answer is 80.0, as it logically follows from the given data.",
