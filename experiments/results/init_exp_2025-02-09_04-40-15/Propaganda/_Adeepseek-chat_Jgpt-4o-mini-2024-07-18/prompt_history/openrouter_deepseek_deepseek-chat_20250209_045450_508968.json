Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 4.0. The question states that \"5 more than half the cows are black.\" To solve this, first calculate half of the cows: 18 / 2 = 9. Then add 5 to this number to find the number of black cows: 9 + 5 = 14. Finally, subtract the number of black cows from the total number of cows to find the number of non-black cows: 18 - 14 = 4. This straightforward interpretation aligns perfectly with the wording of the question, making (A) the correct answer.",
