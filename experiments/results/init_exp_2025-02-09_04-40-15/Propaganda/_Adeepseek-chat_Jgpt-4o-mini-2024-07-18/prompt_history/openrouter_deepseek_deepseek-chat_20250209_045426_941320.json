Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

Additionally, there was a nest with 4 eggs in her front yard. Adding these together, 10 + 3 + 4 = 17 eggs. The calculation in (A) incorrectly adds the number of nests to the number of eggs in the first tree, leading to an incorrect total. Therefore, the accurate total number of eggs June found is 17.",
