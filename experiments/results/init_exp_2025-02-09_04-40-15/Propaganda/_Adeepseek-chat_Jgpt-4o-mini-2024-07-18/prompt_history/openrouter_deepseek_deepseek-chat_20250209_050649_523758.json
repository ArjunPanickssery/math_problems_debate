Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

She gave $250 to the cashier, so the change she received is $250 - $240 = $10. The calculations in answer (B) are accurate and correctly reflect the total cost and the change Laura should receive. Answer (A) incorrectly swaps the prices of the pants and shirts, leading to an erroneous total and negative change, which is not possible in this context.",
