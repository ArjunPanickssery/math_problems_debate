Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (B): 4.0. Tom needs a total of 60 feet of rope to lower it down 6 stories (10 feet per story \u00d7 6 stories = 60 feet). Each piece of rope is 20 feet long, but when lashed together, he loses 25% of its length, which is 5 feet per piece. Therefore, each piece effectively provides only 15 feet of usable rope. To achieve 60 feet, he needs 60 \u00f7 15 = 4 pieces of rope. Answer (A) ignores the loss of length when lashing the ropes together, leading to an incorrect calculation. Thus, 4 pieces are required.",
