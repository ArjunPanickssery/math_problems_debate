Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 36.0. The question states that 40% of Mr. Sanchez's students got a final grade below B, which means the remaining 60% achieved a grade of B or above. To find the number of students who got B and above, we calculate 60% of the total number of students, which is 60. Therefore, 60 x 60/100 = 36 students received a grade of B or above. This calculation is straightforward and aligns with the information provided in the question. Answer (B) incorrectly uses the 40% figure, which represents the students who did not achieve a B or above, leading to an incorrect result.",
