Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 274.0. The problem states that Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked. This translates to the equation Kayla = 10 + 4x, where x is the number of apples Kylie picked. The total number of apples is 340, so we set up the equation 340 = x + (10 + 4x). Simplifying, we get 340 = 5x + 10, leading to 330 = 5x, and thus x = 66. Substituting back, Kayla picked 10 + 4(66) = 274 apples. This aligns perfectly with the given information.",
