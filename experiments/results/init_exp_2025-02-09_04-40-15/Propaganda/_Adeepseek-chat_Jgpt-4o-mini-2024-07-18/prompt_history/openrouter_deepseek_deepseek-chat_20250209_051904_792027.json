Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

Mr. Ha has 5 more silver dollars than Mr. Phung, so he has 72 + 5 = 77 silver dollars. Adding these together, the total number of silver dollars is 56 + 72 + 77 = 205. The error in (B) is that it incorrectly calculates Mr. Ha's silver dollars by adding 5 to Mr. Chiu's total instead of Mr. Phung's, leading to an incorrect total of 189.",
