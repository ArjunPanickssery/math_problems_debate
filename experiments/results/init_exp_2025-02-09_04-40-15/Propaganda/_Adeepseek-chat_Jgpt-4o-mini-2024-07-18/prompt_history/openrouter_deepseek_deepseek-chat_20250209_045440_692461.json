Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

How far does he move horizontally, in feet?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2700.0\nHe travels 1450-100=1350 feet vertically\nSo he travels 1350*2=2700 feet horizontally\n#### 2700\n(B): 2900.0\nHe reaches an elevation of 1450 feet\nSince he moves 2 feet horizontally for each vertical foot, he travels 1450*2=2900 feet horizontally\n#### 2900</question>\n<your_answer></your_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 2700.0. John's elevation increases from 100 feet to 1450 feet, which means he climbs a total of 1350 feet vertically. Given that he travels 1 foot vertically for every 2 feet horizontally, the horizontal distance he covers is calculated by multiplying the vertical distance by 2. Therefore, 1350 feet vertically * 2 = 2700 feet horizontally. This calculation correctly accounts for the change in elevation, not the final elevation itself, which is why (B) is incorrect.",
