Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 9.0. Maria received a 40% discount on the regular ticket price of $15. To calculate the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: 40/100 * 15 = $6. This $6 is subtracted from the original price to determine the final amount Maria paid: $15 - $6 = $9. Therefore, Maria paid $9 for the ticket. Answer (B) incorrectly assumes that the discounted price is simply 40% of the original price, which would mean Maria paid $6, but this is not how discounts are applied.",
