Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (B): 65.0. On Wednesday, 37 students played kickball. On Thursday, 9 fewer students played, so 37 - 9 = 28 students played on Thursday. Adding the number of students from both days, 37 + 28 = 65. This calculation correctly accounts for the decrease in students on Thursday and provides the total number of students who played kickball over the two days. Answer (A) incorrectly adds 9 students to Wednesday's total, which misinterprets the problem's requirement to find the total number of students who played on both days.",
