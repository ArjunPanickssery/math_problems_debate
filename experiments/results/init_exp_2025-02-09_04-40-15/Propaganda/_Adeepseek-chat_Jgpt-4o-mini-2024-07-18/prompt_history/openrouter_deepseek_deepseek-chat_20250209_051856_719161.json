Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (B): 8.0. The question states that the box of 12 chocolate bars was shared equally between Mike, Rita, and Anita. This means each person received 12 divided by 3, which is 4 bars. The question specifically asks for the combined number of bars that Mike and Rita received. Since Mike got 4 bars and Rita got 4 bars, together they received 4 + 4 = 8 bars. Therefore, the correct answer is 8.0. Answer (A) incorrectly suggests that Mike and Rita shared 4 bars together, which contradicts the equal distribution described in the question.",
