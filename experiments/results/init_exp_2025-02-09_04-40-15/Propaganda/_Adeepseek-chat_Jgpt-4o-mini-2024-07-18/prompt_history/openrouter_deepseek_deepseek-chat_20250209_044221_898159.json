Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

To find the total number of books Stu and Albert have together, we add Stu's 9 books to Albert's 36 books, resulting in 45 books. The calculation is straightforward and aligns with the question's wording, making (A) the accurate answer.",
