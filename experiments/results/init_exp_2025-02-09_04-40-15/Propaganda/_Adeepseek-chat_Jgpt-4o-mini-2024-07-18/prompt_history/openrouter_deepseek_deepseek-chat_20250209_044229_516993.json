Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "Emily\u2019s hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's hair, and Logan's hair is 20 inches. Therefore, Emily\u2019s hair is 20 + 6 = 26 inches long. Kate's hair is half as long as Emily's, so Kate's hair is 26 / 2 = 13 inches. The correct answer is (A): 13. The mistake in (B) arises from incorrectly subtracting 6 inches from Logan's hair length instead of adding it, leading to an incorrect calculation of Emily\u2019s and subsequently Kate\u2019s hair length.",
