Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

She has 4 times as many purple marbles as orange marbles, so she has 22 \u00d7 4 = 88 purple marbles. Adding them all together, Katie has 13 + 22 + 88 = 123 marbles in total. The calculation in (B) incorrectly subtracts 9 from 13 to find the number of orange marbles, leading to an incorrect total. Therefore, (A) is the correct answer.",
