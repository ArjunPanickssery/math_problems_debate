Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 17.0. The reasoning is straightforward: if the dog will be 4 years old in 2 years, it must currently be 2 years old. Since the dog was born when I was 15, adding the dog's current age to my age at that time gives my current age: 15 + 2 = 17. This is a simple linear calculation that directly follows from the information provided. Answer (B) incorrectly adds the dog's future age (4) to my age at the time of the dog's birth, which is not logically consistent with the timeline given.",
