Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

Therefore, Mary has 37 shirts left, making answer (B) correct. The calculations in (A) incorrectly apply the fractions to the wrong shirt colors, leading to an erroneous total.",
