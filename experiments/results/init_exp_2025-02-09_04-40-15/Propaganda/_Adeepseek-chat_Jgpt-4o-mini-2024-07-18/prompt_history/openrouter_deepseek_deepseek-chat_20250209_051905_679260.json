Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

Tim then buys half of what he has left, which is \\( \\frac{x - 6}{2} \\). Adding these together gives \\( x - 6 + \\frac{x - 6}{2} = 24 \\). Simplifying, we get \\( 2x - 12 + x - 6 = 48 \\), then \\( 3x - 18 = 48 \\), and finally \\( 3x = 66 \\), so \\( x = 22 \\). This calculation is consistent and correctly follows the problem\u2019s logic, making 22 the correct answer.",
