Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

The total apples picked together is 340, so the equation is \\( x + (10 + 4x) = 340 \\). Simplifying, we get \\( 5x + 10 = 340 \\), then \\( 5x = 330 \\), and \\( x = 66 \\). Plugging back in, Kayla picked \\( 10 + 4(66) = 274 \\) apples. This aligns perfectly with the problem's conditions, making (A) the correct answer.",
