Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (B): 56.0. The question states that 20% of the total crayons are broken, not 20% of the remaining crayons after accounting for the new ones. Therefore, the calculation should be based on the total number of crayons. First, one third of 120 crayons are new, which is 40. Then, 20% of 120 crayons are broken, which is 24. Subtracting these from the total gives 120 - 40 - 24 = 56 slightly used crayons. This approach directly follows the problem's wording and ensures accurate results.",
