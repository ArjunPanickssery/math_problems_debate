Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 144.0. Melissa makes two trips to town each month, and each trip takes 3 hours to drive to town and 3 hours to drive back, totaling 6 hours per trip. Therefore, for two trips, she spends 6x2=12 hours driving each month. Over the course of a year, which has 12 months, she spends 12x12=144 hours driving. The calculation in answer (B) incorrectly assumes that the 3-hour duration covers both the trip to town and the return trip, which is not the case. Thus, the correct total driving time in a year is 144 hours.",
