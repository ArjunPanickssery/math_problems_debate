Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 36.0. The question specifies that the school already has 12 robes and only needs to purchase the remaining robes for the 30 singers. Therefore, the number of robes to buy is 30 - 12 = 18. Multiplying 18 robes by $2 per robe gives a total cost of $36. Answer (B) incorrectly assumes the school needs to buy robes for all 30 singers, ignoring the fact that 12 robes are already available. The question clearly asks for the cost of purchasing the *remaining* robes, not the total cost for all singers.",
