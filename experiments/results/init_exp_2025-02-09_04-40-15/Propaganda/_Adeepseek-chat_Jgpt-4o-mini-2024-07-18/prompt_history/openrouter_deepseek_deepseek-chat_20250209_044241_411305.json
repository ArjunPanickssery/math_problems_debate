Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (B): 750.0. To solve this, first calculate the number of red jelly beans: 4000 * 3/4 = 3000. Then, determine the number of coconut-flavored jelly beans by taking one quarter of the red jelly beans: 3000 * 1/4 = 750. This method correctly follows the sequence of operations specified in the question, ensuring that the coconut-flavored jelly beans are a subset of the red jelly beans. Answer (A) incorrectly assumes that the coconut-flavored jelly beans are directly one quarter of the total jelly beans, which is not supported by the problem statement.",
