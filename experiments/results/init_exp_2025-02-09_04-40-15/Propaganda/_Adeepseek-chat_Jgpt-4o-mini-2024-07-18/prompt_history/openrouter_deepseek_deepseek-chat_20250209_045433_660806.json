Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

The difference between the number of books Peter has read and the number his brother has read is 6 (8 - 2 = 6). The question asks for the difference in the number of books read, not a scaled value or any other interpretation. Therefore, the straightforward calculation leads to the correct answer of 6.0. There is no need to scale the difference by the total number of books, making (B) incorrect.",
