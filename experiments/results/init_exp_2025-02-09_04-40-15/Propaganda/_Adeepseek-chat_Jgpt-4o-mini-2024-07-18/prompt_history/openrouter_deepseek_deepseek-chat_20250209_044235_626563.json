Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 408.0. To determine the initial amount, we must work backwards step by step. After buying the book, Isabel has $51 left, which is half of the amount she had before purchasing the book. Therefore, she had $102 before buying the book. This $102 is half of the amount she had before buying the toy, meaning she initially had $204 before buying the toy. However, this $204 is also half of her original amount, so she must have started with $408. This method ensures we account for all expenditures correctly, leading to the accurate initial amount.",
