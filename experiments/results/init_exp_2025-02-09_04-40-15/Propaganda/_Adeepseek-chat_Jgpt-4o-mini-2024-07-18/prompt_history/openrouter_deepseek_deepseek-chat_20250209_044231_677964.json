Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

The total number of toys is the sum of toy cars and toy soldiers, which is 20 + 40 = 60. The answer (A): 40.0 incorrectly assumes that the total number of toys is only the number of toy soldiers, ignoring the toy cars. Thus, the correct total number of toys James buys is 60.",
