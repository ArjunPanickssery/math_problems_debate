Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (B): 32.0. The question states there are 14 red crayons and 5 more blue crayons than red crayons, so blue crayons = 14 + 5 = 19. It then says there are 6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons, meaning yellow crayons = (19 * 2) - 6 = 32. The calculation is straightforward and aligns perfectly with the wording of the question. Answer (A) incorrectly adds 6 instead of subtracting, which misinterprets the problem. Therefore, (B) is the correct and logical solution.",
