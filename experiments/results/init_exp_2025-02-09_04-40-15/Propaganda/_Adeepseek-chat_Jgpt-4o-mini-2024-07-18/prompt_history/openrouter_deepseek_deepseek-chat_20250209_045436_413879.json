Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

Given that there are three times as many girls as boys, the ratio of boys to total students is 1:4. Therefore, the number of boys in the Biology class is calculated as 1/4 of 100, which equals 25. This is a straightforward application of the given ratios and the total number of students in the Biology class.",
