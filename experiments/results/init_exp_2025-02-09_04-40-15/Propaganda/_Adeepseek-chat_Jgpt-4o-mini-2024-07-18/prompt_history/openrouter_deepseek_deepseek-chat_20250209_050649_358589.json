Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 7.0. The calculation is straightforward: 20 gallons equal 160 pints (since 1 gallon = 8 pints). Dividing 160 pints by 80 containers gives 2 pints per container. Geraldo drank 3.5 containers, so 3.5 * 2 pints = 7 pints. The error in (B) arises from incorrectly converting gallons to pints, using 120 pints instead of 160. This miscalculation leads to an incorrect final answer of 5.25 pints. Therefore, the accurate and logical solution is (A), confirming Geraldo drank 7 pints of tea.",
