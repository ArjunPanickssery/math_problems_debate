Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

Adding these together, Sam won a total of 50 + 60 = 110 matches. The calculation is straightforward and directly based on the given percentages and the number of matches. Answer (A) incorrectly assumes a final win rate of 60% across all 200 matches, which is not supported by the information provided. The correct total number of wins is 110.",
