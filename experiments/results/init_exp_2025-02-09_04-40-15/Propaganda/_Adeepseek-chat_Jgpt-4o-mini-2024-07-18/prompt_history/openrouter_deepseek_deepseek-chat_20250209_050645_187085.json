Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

Adding the $3 tax brings the total cost to $15. Subtracting $15 from $18 leaves them with $3 in change. Answer (B) incorrectly calculates the cost of the sodas as $1 instead of $2, leading to an incorrect total change of $4. The accurate calculation supports answer (A).",
