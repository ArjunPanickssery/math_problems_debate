Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 25.0. The Biology class has 100 students, as it is half the size of the Physics class. Since there are three times as many girls as boys, the total number of students can be divided into four equal parts: three parts girls and one part boys. Therefore, the number of boys is one-fourth of the total number of students in the Biology class, which is 100/4 = 25. This straightforward calculation aligns with the given conditions and provides a clear, logical solution.",
