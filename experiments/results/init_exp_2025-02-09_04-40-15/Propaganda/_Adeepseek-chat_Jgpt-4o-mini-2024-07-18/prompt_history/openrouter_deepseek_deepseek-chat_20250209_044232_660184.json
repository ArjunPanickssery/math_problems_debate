Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

The discount is calculated as 40/100 * 15 = $6. Therefore, the final price Maria paid is $15 - $6 = $9. Answer (B) incorrectly assumes that the discounted price is simply 40% of the original price, which is a misunderstanding of how discounts are applied. The correct answer is (A): 9.0.",
