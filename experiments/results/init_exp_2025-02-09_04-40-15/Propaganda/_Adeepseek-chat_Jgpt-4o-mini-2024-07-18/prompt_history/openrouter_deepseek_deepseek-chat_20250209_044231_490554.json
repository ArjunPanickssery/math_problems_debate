Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (B): 160.0. Brianne saves $10 in January, and each subsequent month she saves twice as much as the previous month. In February, she saves $10 x 2 = $20. In March, she saves $20 x 2 = $40. In April, she saves $40 x 2 = $80. Finally, in May, she saves $80 x 2 = $160. This pattern clearly follows the rule of doubling the previous month's savings, leading to $160 in May. The other answer (A) incorrectly multiplies by 3 each month, which does not align with the problem's instructions.",
