Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 8.0. The phrase \"twice more scoops\" implies that Victoria has twice the number of scoops in addition to Oli's original amount. Therefore, Victoria's scoops are calculated as 4 + (2 \u00d7 4) = 12 scoops. Subtracting Oli's 4 scoops from Victoria's 12 scoops gives us 8 more scoops. This interpretation aligns with the common understanding that \"twice more\" means adding double the original quantity, not just doubling it. Thus, Victoria has 8 more scoops than Oli.",
