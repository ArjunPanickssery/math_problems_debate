Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

For every dozen, she gets 2 free flowers, so for 3 dozen, she gets 3 x 2 = 6 free flowers. Adding the regular and free flowers together, Maria has 36 + 6 = 42 flowers in total. The additional 2 free flowers in answer (B) are incorrect because the promotion applies per dozen, not per total purchase. Therefore, the total number of flowers Maria has is 42.",
