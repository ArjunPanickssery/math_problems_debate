Henry and his brother each eat one apple per day, so together they consume 2 apples daily. With 3 boxes totaling 42 apples, the apples will last for 42 apples \u00f7 2 apples/day = 21 days. Since there are 7 days in a week, 21 days \u00f7 7 days/week = 3 weeks. Answer (B) incorrectly assumes only one person is consuming the apples, leading to a miscalculation. The apples are shared between two people, so the duration is halved. Thus, the correct number of weeks is 3.0.\n\n\nBased on the information and arguments above, give a probability between 0 and 1 that you think answer A is correct.\n\nYou must give your answer in the form\n\n{'prob': (some float between 0 and 1)}"
