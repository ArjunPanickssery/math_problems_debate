Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 2.0. To determine how many hours John needs to watch each day, we first calculate the total viewing time: 20 episodes * 30 minutes = 600 minutes. Converting minutes to hours, we divide by 60, resulting in 10 hours. To find the daily viewing time over 5 days, we divide 10 hours by 5, yielding 2 hours per day. The calculation in (B) is incorrect because it mistakenly divides 600 minutes by 100 instead of 60, leading to an erroneous total of 6 hours. Therefore, the accurate daily viewing time is 2 hours.",
