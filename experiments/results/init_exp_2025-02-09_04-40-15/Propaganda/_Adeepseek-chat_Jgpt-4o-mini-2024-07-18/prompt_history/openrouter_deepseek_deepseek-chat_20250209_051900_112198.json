Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (B): 8.0. The box contains 12 bars, and they are shared equally among Mike, Rita, and Anita. Dividing 12 by 3 gives each person 4 bars. Since Mike and Rita are two people, their combined share is 4 + 4 = 8 bars. The question specifically asks for the total number of bars Mike and Rita received together, not individually. Therefore, the correct answer is 8 bars. Answer (A) incorrectly assumes that Mike and Rita shared a single portion, which is not the case since each person received their own equal share.",
