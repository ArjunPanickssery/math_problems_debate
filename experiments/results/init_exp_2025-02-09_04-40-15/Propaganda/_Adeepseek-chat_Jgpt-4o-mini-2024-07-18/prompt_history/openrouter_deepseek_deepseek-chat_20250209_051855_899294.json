Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (B): 44.0. Twenty years ago, Shane was 2 times Garret's current age, which is 12. Therefore, Shane was 24 years old twenty years ago. To find Shane's current age, we simply add the 20 years that have passed since then. Thus, Shane is now 24 + 20 = 44 years old. The calculation is straightforward and does not require accounting for the time difference twice, as suggested in answer (A). The logic in (B) is clear and directly follows the information provided in the question.",
