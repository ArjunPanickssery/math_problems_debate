Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

Since there are 45 pirates, the number of noodles is 45 - 7 = 38. To find the total number of noodles and pirates, we add the number of noodles (38) to the number of pirates (45), which equals 83. Therefore, the total number of noodles and pirates in the matrix is 83.",
