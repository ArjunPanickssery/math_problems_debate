Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

After paying the tax, she had $50 - $10 = $40 left. Then, she paid a $5 processing fee, leaving her with $40 - $5 = $35. The tax is calculated on the total winnings before any fees are deducted, so the processing fee is subtracted after the tax has been applied. Therefore, Winwin was able to take home $35.",
