Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (B): 32.0. The question states there are 14 red crayons, 5 more blue crayons than red crayons, and 6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons. Calculating step-by-step:  \n1. Blue crayons = 14 (red) + 5 = 19.  \n2. Yellow crayons = 2 \u00d7 19 (blue) - 6 = 32.  \nThe formula \"6 less than double the blue crayons\" clearly means subtracting 6 from double the blue crayons, not adding. Therefore, the correct number of yellow crayons is 32, making (B) the right answer.",
