Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

To find out how many more calories he ate than his daily goal of 1800, we subtract his goal from his actual intake: 2400 - 1800 = 600. This calculation clearly shows that Jacob consumed 600 calories more than he planned. The other answer, 4200, is incorrect because it results from adding the total calories to the goal, which does not make sense in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is 600.",
