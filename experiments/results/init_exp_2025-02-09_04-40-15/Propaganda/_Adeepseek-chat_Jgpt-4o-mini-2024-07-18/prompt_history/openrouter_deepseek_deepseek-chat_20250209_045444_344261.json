Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (B): $20,800. Jame's new weekly earnings are $20/hour * 40 hours = $800. His old weekly earnings were $16/hour * 25 hours = $400. The difference in weekly earnings is $800 - $400 = $400. To find the annual difference, multiply by 52 weeks: $400 * 52 = $20,800. This calculation accurately reflects the total additional income Jame earns in a year with his new job compared to his old job. Answer (A) incorrectly calculates the difference by only considering the hourly rate increase and not the full impact of the increased hours worked.",
