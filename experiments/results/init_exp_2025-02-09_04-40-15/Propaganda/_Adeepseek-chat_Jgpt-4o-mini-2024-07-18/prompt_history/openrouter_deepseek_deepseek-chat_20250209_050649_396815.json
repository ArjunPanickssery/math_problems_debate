Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (B): 4.0. The phrase \"twice more\" is commonly interpreted as \"twice as many,\" meaning Victoria has double the scoops of Oli. Oli has 4 scoops, so Victoria has 4 x 2 = 8 scoops. The difference is 8 - 4 = 4 scoops. Answer (A) incorrectly interprets \"twice more\" as adding double the amount to the original, leading to an inflated total of 12 scoops. This interpretation is less standard and less accurate in this context. Therefore, Victoria has 4 more scoops than Oli, making (B) the correct answer.",
