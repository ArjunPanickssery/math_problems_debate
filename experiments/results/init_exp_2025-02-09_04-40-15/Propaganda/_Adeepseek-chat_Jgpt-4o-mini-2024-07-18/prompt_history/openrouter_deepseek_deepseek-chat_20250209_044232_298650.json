Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

He used 4 parts, which means he used 5 x 4 = 20 meters of the ribbon. To find the unused portion, subtract the used length from the total length: 30 - 20 = 10 meters. Therefore, 10 meters of ribbon are not used. Answer (B) incorrectly calculates the length of each part as 7.5 meters by dividing 30 by 4 instead of 6, leading to an incorrect result of 15 meters unused.",
