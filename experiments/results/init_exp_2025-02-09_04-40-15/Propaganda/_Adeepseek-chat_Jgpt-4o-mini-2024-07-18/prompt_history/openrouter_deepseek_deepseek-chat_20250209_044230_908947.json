Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (B): 277.0. Mr. Curtis has 325 chickens in total, with 28 being roosters. Subtracting the roosters from the total gives 297 hens. Out of these 297 hens, 20 do not lay eggs. Therefore, the number of egg-laying hens is 297 - 20 = 277. The calculation in (A) is incorrect because it mistakenly adds the 20 non-laying hens back into the total, leading to an erroneous conclusion. The straightforward subtraction of non-laying hens from the total hens accurately yields the correct number of egg-laying hens.",
