Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 6.0. Two of the CDs are each 1.5 hours, so their combined length is 1.5 * 2 = 3 hours. The third CD is twice as long as one of the shorter CDs, so it is 1.5 * 2 = 3 hours. Adding these together, the total length is 3 + 3 = 6 hours. Answer (B) incorrectly adds only one of the shorter CDs, leading to an incorrect total of 4.5 hours. The question clearly asks for the combined length of all three CDs, making (A) the correct choice.",
