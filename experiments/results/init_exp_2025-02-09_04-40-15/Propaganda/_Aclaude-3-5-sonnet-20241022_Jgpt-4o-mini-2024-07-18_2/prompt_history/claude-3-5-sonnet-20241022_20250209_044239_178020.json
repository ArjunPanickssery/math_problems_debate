Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

Half the ears of corn have 500 kernels of corn and the other half have 100 more. How many kernels of corn does Hilary have to shuck?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 237600.0\nShe has 108 * 4 = 432 ears of corn to shuck.\nShe gets 500 kernels of corn from half the ears and 500 + 100 = 600 kernels from the other half.\nHalf the number of ears of corn is 432 / 2 = 216 ears.\nThus, Hilary has 216 * 500 + 216 * 600 = 108000 + 129600 = 237600 kernels to shuck.\n#### 237600\n(B): 259200\nShe has 108 * 4 = 432 ears of corn to shuck.\nEach ear of corn has 500 kernels as a base amount.\nAdding the additional 100 kernels to each ear gives 600 kernels per ear.\nThus, Hilary has 432 * 600 = 259200 kernels to shuck.\n#### 259200</question>\n<your_answer></your_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"
