Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

How tall is he in feet?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 6.0\nHe gained 2*3=6 inches\nSo his height is 66+6=72 inches\nSo he is 72/12=6 feet tall\n#### 6\n(B): 17.0\nFirst find total change in height:\n(66+2)*3 = 68*3 = 204 inches\nConvert to feet: 204/12 = 17 feet\n#### 17.0</question>\n<your_answer></your_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"
