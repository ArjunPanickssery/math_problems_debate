Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

If it takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back, how many hours does Melissa spend driving in a year?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 72.0\nMelissa spends 2x3=6 hours driving each month.\nSince there are 12 months in a year, she spends 6x12=72 hours driving each year.\n#### 72\n(A): 144.0\nEach round trip consists of a 3-hour drive to town and a 3-hour drive back, totaling 6 hours per trip.\nSince Melissa makes two trips per month, she drives 6x2=12 hours monthly.\nIn a year, she spends 12x12=144 hours driving.\n#### 144</question>\n<your_answer></your_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"
