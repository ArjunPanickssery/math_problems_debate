Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

What will be Matt's age 10 years from now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 25.0\nBush is younger than Matt by 3 years, so if Bush is 12 years old then Matt is 12+3 = 15 years old\nIn 10 years' time, Matt will be 10+15 = 25 years old\n#### 25\n(B): 28.0\nBush is 12, Matt is 3 years older, so Matt is 12+3 = 15\nSince Matt will always be 3 years older, we add 3 again: 15+3 = 18\nIn 10 years' time, Matt will be 18+10 = 28\n#### 28</question>\n<your_answer></your_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"
