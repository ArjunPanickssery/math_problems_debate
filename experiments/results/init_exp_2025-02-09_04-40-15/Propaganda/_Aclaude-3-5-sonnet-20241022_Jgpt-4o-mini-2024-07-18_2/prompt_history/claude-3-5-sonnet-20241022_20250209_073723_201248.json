Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

They also got 2 sodas for $1.00 each. The tax came to $3. How much change should they have received in total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 3.0\nLee and his friend had a total of $10 + $8 = $18.\nThe cost of the food was $6 + $4 + $1 + $1 = $12.\nThe total cost, including tax was $12 + $3 = $15.\nThey should have received $18 - $15 = $3 in total.\n#### 3\n(B): 4.0\nLee and friend pooled $10 + $8 = $18.\nThe cost of items was $6 + $4 + $1 = $11.\nTotal with tax was $11 + $3 = $14.\nThey should receive $18 - $14 = $4 in change.\n#### 4</question>\n<your_answer></your_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"

It's crucial to count both sodas since the question clearly states \"2 sodas for $1.00 each.\" Let me verify the math:",
