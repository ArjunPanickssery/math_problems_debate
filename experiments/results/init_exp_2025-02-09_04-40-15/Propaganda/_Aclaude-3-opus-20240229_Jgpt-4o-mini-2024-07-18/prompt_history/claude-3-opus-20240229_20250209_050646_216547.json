Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "Here is my argument for why answer (A) is correct:\n\nThe question asks how much more money one company made than the other. To calculate this, we need to find the difference in total revenue between the two companies. Company A sold 300 bottles at $4 each, for a total revenue of $1200. Company B sold 350 bottles at $3.50 each, for a total revenue of $1225. The difference in revenue is $1225 - $1200 = $25. Therefore, Company B made $25 more than Company A. The $325 figure in answer (A) represents the difference in price per bottle multiplied by the total bottles sold, which is not what the question asked for.",
