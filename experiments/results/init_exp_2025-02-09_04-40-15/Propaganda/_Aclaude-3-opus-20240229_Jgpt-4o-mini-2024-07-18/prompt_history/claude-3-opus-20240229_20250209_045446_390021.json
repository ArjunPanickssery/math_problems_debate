Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

To calculate his total wins, we simply add the wins from each set of 100 matches together. 50 wins from the first 100 matches plus 60 wins from the second 100 matches equals a total of 110 match wins for Sam across the 200 matches he played.",
