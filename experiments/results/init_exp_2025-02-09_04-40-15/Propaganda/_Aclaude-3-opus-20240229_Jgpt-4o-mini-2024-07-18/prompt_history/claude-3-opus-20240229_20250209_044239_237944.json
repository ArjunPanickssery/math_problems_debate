Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "Here is my argument for why (A) is correct:\nJohn started at 66 inches tall. Over the 3 months, he grew an additional 2 inches per month, for a total of 6 inches (2 inches/month * 3 months = 6 inches total growth). So after the growth spurt, his new height is his original height of 66 inches plus the additional 6 inches of growth, which equals 72 inches total (66 + 6 = 72). Converting 72 inches to feet, since there are 12 inches in a foot, gives us 6 feet (72 inches / 12 inches/foot = 6 feet). Therefore, after his 3 month growth spurt, John is 6 feet tall.",
