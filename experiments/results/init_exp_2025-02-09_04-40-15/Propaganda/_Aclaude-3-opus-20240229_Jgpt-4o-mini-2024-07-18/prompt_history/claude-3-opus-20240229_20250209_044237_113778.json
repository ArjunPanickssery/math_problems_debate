Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

Since there were 12 ants and 8 ladybugs originally, and 2 ladybugs flew away, the correct calculation is 12 ants + (8 - 2) ladybugs = 18 total insects. The 3 spiders should not be included in the count of insects in the playground.",
