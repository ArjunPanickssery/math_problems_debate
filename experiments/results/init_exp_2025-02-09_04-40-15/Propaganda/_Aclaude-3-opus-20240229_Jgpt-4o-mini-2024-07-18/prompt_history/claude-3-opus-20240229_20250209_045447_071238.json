Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "Here is my argument for why (B) 1000 is the correct answer:\n\nJames can carry 10 bags per trip and makes 20 trips per day. So in one day, he delivers 10 x 20 = 200 bags. Over the course of 5 days, he would deliver 200 bags per day x 5 days = 1000 total bags. The calculation is straightforward - multiply the number of bags per trip by trips per day to get bags per day, then multiply by the number of days to get the total over 5 days. 1000 bags delivered in 5 days is the correct result.",
