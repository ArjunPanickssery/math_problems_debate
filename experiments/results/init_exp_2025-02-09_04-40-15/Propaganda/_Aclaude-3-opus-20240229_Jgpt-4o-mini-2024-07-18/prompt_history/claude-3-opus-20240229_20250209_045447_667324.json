Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "Here is my argument for why (A) 205.0 is the correct answer:\n\nMr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars. Mr. Phung has 16 more than Mr. Chiu, so Mr. Phung has 56 + 16 = 72 silver dollars. The question states that Mr. Ha has 5 more silver dollars than Mr. Phung. Since Mr. Phung has 72 silver dollars, Mr. Ha must have 72 + 5 = 77 silver dollars. To calculate the total, we add up the silver dollars of all three men: 56 + 72 + 77 = 205. Therefore, the three men have a total of 205 silver dollars.",
