Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

Katie has half as many books as Darla, which means she has 6/2 = 3 books. The question then says Gary has 5 times the number of books that Darla and Katie have combined. Darla and Katie together have 6 + 3 = 9 books. So Gary has 5 * 9 = 45 books. In total, Darla, Katie and Gary have 6 + 3 + 45 = 54 books.",
