Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "Here is my argument for answer (B) 360 packs being correct:\n\nJohn has 6 classes with 30 students each, for a total of 6*30 = 180 students. The question states that he buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students. Since there are 180 students and he buys 2 packs per student, the total number of packs is 180 students * 2 packs per student = 360 packs. The calculation is straightforward - multiply the total number of students by the number of packs per student. Answer (A) 12 packs cannot be correct, as that only accounts for 2 packs per class, not 2 packs per student as the question specifies.",
