Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "Here is my argument for why (A) is correct:\n\nThe shoebox has a base area of 24 square inches, calculated by multiplying the length and width (6 inches x 4 inches = 24 square inches). The square block placed inside has an area of 16 square inches (4 inches x 4 inches). To determine the uncovered area, we subtract the block's area from the shoebox's base area: 24 square inches - 16 square inches = 8 square inches. Therefore, 8 square inches of the shoebox's base are left uncovered by the block.",
