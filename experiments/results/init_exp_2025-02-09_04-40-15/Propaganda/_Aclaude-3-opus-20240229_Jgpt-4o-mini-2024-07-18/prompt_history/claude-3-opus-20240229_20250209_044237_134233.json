Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "Here is my argument for why (A) is correct:\n\nSteve reads 100 pages on each of the 3 days he reads per week - Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. At this rate of 100 pages per day, it will take him 2100/100 = 21 days to finish the 2100 page book. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the number of weeks by dividing the 21 days by 7, which equals exactly 3 weeks. Therefore, at Steve's current reading pace, he will complete the lengthy book in 3 weeks time.",
