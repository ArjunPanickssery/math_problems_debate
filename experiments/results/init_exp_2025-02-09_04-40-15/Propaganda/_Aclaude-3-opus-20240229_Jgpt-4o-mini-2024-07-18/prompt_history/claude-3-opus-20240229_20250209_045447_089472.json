Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "Here is my argument for why 5 classes per semester is the correct answer:\n\nTo determine how many classes Maddy needs to take each semester, we first calculate the total number of classes required by dividing the 120 total credits by 3 credits per class. This gives us 40 total classes needed to graduate. Since Maddy is in college for 8 semesters, we then divide the 40 total classes by 8 semesters, which equals 5 classes per semester. Therefore, taking 5 classes each semester for 8 semesters will allow Maddy to earn the 120 credits necessary to graduate.",
