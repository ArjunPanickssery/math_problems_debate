Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "Here is my argument for why (B) 4.0 is the correct answer:\n\nThe total amount of money Lee and his friend had was $10 + $8 = $18. The chicken wings cost $6, the chicken salad was $4, and they got 2 sodas at $1 each, for a subtotal of $6 + $4 + $1 + $1 = $12. However, the question states there was a $3 tax on top of that. So the total bill, with tax included, came to $12 + $3 = $15. Since they originally had $18 and the total cost was $15, the amount of change they should have received is $18 - $15 = $3. Therefore, the correct answer is that they should have received $3 in change, not $4.",
