Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue that (A) 37 is the correct answer.\n\nThe question states that the child is making a 5-level pyramid, with 9 blocks in the first row. For each subsequent row, the child uses 2 blocks less than the row below it. \n\nFollowing this pattern, the second row will have 7 blocks (2 less than 9). The third, fourth, and fifth rows will also have 7 blocks each, as they are all 2 less than the 9 blocks in the first row.\n\nSo in total, there is 1 row with 9 blocks and 4 rows with 7 blocks each. This gives us:\n9 + (4 \u00d7 7) = 9 + 28 = 37 total blocks.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) 37 blocks. The pyramid has a wide base of 9 blocks, with the 4 upper levels each having a consistent 7 blocks, totaling to 37 blocks altogether.",
