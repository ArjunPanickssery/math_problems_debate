Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue for answer (B): 25.0.\n\nThe question states that the child is making a 5-level pyramid, with each level having 2 fewer blocks than the level below it. We are given that the bottom level has 9 blocks. \n\nFollowing this pattern, the second level will have 9 - 2 = 7 blocks. The third level will have 7 - 2 = 5 blocks. The fourth level will have 5 - 2 = 3 blocks. Finally, the top level will have 3 - 2 = 1 block.\n\nTo find the total number of blocks, we simply add up the number of blocks on each level: 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 25 blocks total.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 25 blocks. The pyramid tapers as it goes up, with each level having 2 fewer blocks than the one below it.",
