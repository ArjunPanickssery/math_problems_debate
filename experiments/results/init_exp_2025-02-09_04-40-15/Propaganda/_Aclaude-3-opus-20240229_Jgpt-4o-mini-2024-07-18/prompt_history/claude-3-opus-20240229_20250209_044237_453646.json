Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "Here is my argument for why (A) is the correct answer:\n\nThe Biology class has half as many students as the Physics class, which has 200 students. So the Biology class has 100 students total. We're told there are 3 times as many girls as boys. Let's represent the number of boys as x. Then the number of girls is 3x. The total class size is x + 3x = 4x. We know this equals 100, so 4x = 100. Solving, x = 25. Therefore, there are 25 boys in the Biology class.",
