Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

The calculation shows that half of 36 brown shirts is 18 shirts, and a third of 26 blue shirts, rounded to the nearest whole number, is approximately 9 shirts. After giving those away, Mary would have 17 blue shirts and 18 brown shirts remaining, for a total of 35 shirts left.",
