Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "Here is my argument for why (A) is the correct answer:\n\nCarl has 30 students in each of his 6 classes, for a total of 180 students (30*6=180). Since he gives each student 10 index cards, he needs a total of 1800 index cards (180*10=1800). Index cards come in packs of 50, so to get 1800 cards, Carl needs to buy 36 packs (1800/50=36). At a cost of $3 per 50-pack, his total expense is $108 (36*3=108). Therefore, the correct amount Carl spent on index cards for his classes is $108.",
