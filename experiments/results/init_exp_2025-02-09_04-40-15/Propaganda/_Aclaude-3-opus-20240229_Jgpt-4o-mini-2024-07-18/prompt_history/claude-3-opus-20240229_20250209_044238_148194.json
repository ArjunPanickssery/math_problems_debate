Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

Mathematically, this means:\nA = 4S\n\nWe can substitute this into the first equation:\n4S + S = 80\n\nSimplifying:\n5S = 80\n\nSolving for S:\nS = 80/5 = 16\n\nTherefore, Sara ate 16 apples, so answer choice (B) 16.0 is correct.",
