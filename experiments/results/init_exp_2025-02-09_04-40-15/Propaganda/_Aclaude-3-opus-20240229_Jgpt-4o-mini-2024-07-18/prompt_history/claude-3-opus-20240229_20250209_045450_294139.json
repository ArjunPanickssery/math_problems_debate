Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "Here is my argument for why (B) 5.25 is the correct answer:\n\n20 gallons equals 160 cups, and since 1 pint is 2 cups, 20 gallons is equivalent to 80 pints. With 80 containers total, each container holds 1 pint of tea. Geraldo drank 3.5 containers, which means he consumed 3.5 pints of tea. 3.5 pints is equal to 5.25 cups (since 1 pint = 1.5 cups). Therefore, the correct answer is that Geraldo drank 5.25 cups, or 3.5 pints, of tea.",
