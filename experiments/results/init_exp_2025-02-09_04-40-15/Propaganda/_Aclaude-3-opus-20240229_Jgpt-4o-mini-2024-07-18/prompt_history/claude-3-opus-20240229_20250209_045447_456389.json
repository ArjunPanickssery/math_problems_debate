Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "Here is my argument for why (A) is the correct answer:\n\nEach part of the ribbon is 30 meters / 6 parts = 5 meters long. Since Isaac used 4 out of the 6 parts, he used 4 parts * 5 meters/part = 20 meters of ribbon total. The original ribbon was 30 meters long, so the amount of ribbon not used is 30 meters - 20 meters = 10 meters. Therefore, 10 meters of the ribbon are not used, making (A) the correct answer.",
