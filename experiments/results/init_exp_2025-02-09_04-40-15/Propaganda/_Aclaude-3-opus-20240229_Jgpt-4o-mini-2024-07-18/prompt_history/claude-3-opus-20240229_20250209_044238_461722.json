Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "Here is my argument for why (A) is the correct answer:\n\nThe mural is 20 ft by 15 ft, which is a total area of 300 square feet. James takes 20 minutes to paint each square foot. So to paint the entire 300 square foot mural, it will take him 300 * 20 = 6000 minutes total. 6000 minutes is equivalent to 100 hours (6000 / 60 minutes per hour = 100 hours). Since James charges $150 per hour, to calculate the total cost we multiply his hourly rate by the number of hours: $150 * 100 hours = $15,000. Therefore, the total amount James will charge to paint the 20x15 ft mural is $15,000.",
