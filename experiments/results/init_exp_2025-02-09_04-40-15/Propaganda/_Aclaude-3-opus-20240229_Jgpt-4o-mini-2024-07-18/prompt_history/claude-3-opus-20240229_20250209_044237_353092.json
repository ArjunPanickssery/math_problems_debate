Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue that (B) 4 is the correct answer.\n\nThe question states that Victoria has twice more scoops of ice cream than Oli. Oli has 4 scoops, so Victoria must have double that amount, which is 8 scoops total. To determine how many more scoops Victoria has compared to Oli, we simply subtract Oli's scoops from Victoria's:\n\n8 scoops (Victoria) - 4 scoops (Oli) = 4 more scoops\n\nTherefore, Victoria has exactly 4 more scoops of ice cream than Oli. The phrasing \"twice more\" means doubling Oli's amount, not adding twice Oli's amount to his original number of scoops.",
