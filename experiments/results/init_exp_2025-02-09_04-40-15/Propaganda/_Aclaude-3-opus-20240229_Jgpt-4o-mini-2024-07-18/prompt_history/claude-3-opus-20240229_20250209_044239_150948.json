Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue that (B) 96.0 is the correct answer.\n\nThe question states that John has to restring 3 basses with 4 strings each, which takes 3*4=12 strings. It also says he needs to restring twice as many guitars as basses, which means 2*3=6 guitars. Since each guitar has 6 strings, this uses 6*6=36 strings.\n\nThe key point is that John must restring 3 fewer 8-string guitars than the normal 6-string guitars. Since there are 6 normal guitars, this means there must be 6-3=3 8-string guitars. Each 8-string guitar requires 8 strings, so the 8-string guitars use 3*8=24 strings.\n\nTherefore, the total number of strings needed is 12 (for basses) + 36 (for 6-string guitars) + 24 (for 8-string guitars) = 72 strings.",
