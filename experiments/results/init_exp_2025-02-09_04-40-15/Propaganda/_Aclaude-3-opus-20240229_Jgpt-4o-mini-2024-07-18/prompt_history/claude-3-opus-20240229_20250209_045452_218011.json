Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "Here is my argument for why (A) 67.0 is the correct answer:\n\nLet x be the number of roosters on the farm. The question states that the number of hens is 5 less than 9 times the number of roosters. So the number of hens is 9x - 5. The total number of chickens is the sum of roosters and hens: x + (9x - 5) = 75. Solving this equation, we get 10x - 5 = 75, which simplifies to 10x = 80. Dividing both sides by 10 yields x = 8. So there are 8 roosters. Plugging this back in, the number of hens is 9(8) - 5 = 67. Therefore, the correct number of hens is 67.",
