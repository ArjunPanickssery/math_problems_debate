Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

If a 50 pack of index cards cost $3 how much did he spend on them all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 108.0\nHe has 30*6=180 students\nSo he needs to buy 180*10=1800 index cards\nThat means he needs to buy 1800/50=36 packs of index cards\nSo he spends 36*3=$108\n#### 108\n(B): 1800\nHe has 30*6=180 students\nSo he needs 180*10=1800 cards\nThat means he needs to buy 1800/3=600 packs\nSo he spends 600*3=$1800\n#### 1800</question>\n<your_answer></your_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"

This gives 180 total students.\n2) Calculate the total number of index cards needed by multiplying the total number of students (180) by the number of cards per student (10). This equals 1800 total index cards.\n3) Since index cards are sold in packs of 50, divide the total number of cards needed (1800) by cards per pack (50) to get the number of packs that must be purchased (36).  \n4) Finally, multiply the number of packs (36) by the cost per pack ($3) to arrive at the total amount spent, which is $108.",
