Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "Here is my argument for why (B) 65 is the correct answer:\n\nThe question states that 37 students played kickball on Wednesday. On Thursday, there were 9 fewer students who played. To calculate the number of students who played on Thursday, we take the number who played on Wednesday (37) and subtract the decrease (9). This gives us 37 - 9 = 28 students who played on Thursday. To find the total number of students who played across both days, we add the number who played on Wednesday (37) and the number who played on Thursday (28). This yields a total of 37 + 28 = 65 students who played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday combined.",
