Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "Here is my argument for why (A) 810 is the correct answer:\n\nBrianne saves $10 in January. In February, she saves twice as much, which is $10 x 2 = $20. Adding this to her previous savings gives her a total of $10 + $20 = $30 saved by the end of February.\nIn March, she saves twice her February savings, which is $20 x 2 = $40. Adding this to her previous total gives her $30 + $40 = $70 total saved by the end of March. \nIn April, she saves $40 x 2 = $80, giving a total of $70 + $80 = $150 saved by the end of April.\nFinally in May, she saves $80 x 2 = $160, for a grand total of $150 + $160 = $310 saved by the end of May.\nTherefore, the amount Brianne will save in the month of May is $160, and her cumulative savings by the end of May will be $310.",
