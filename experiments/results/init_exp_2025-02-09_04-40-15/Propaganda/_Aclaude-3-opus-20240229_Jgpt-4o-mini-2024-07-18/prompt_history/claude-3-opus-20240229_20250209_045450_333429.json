Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

One third of 120 is 40, so there are 40 new crayons. 20% of 120 is 24, so there are 24 broken crayons. To find the number of slightly used crayons, we take the total (120) and subtract the new crayons (40) and the broken crayons (24). 120 - 40 - 24 = 56. Therefore, there are 56 slightly used crayons, making answer choice (B) correct.",
