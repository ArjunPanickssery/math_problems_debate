Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "Here is my argument for why (B) 68.0 is the correct answer:\n\nThe question states that the farm has 5 less than 9 times the number of roosters. If we let x represent the number of roosters, then the number of hens would be represented by 9x-5. The total number of chickens is the sum of the roosters and hens, which equals 75. So we can set up the equation 9x-5+x=75. Simplifying, we get 10x-5=75. Adding 5 to both sides yields 10x=80. Dividing both sides by 10 gives us x=8. Plugging 8 back in for x in the expression for the number of hens, 9x-5, we get 9(8)-5=72-5=67. Therefore, the correct number of hens is 67, so (A) is the right answer.",
