Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "Here is my argument for why (B) 16 is the correct answer:\n\nWyatt has 10 blue envelopes. The question states he has 4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue envelopes. Since he has 10 blue envelopes, to calculate the number of yellow envelopes we take 10 and subtract 4. This equals 6 yellow envelopes. To get the total, we add the number of blue envelopes (10) and yellow envelopes (6). 10 + 6 = 16. Therefore, the total number of envelopes Wyatt has is 16.",
