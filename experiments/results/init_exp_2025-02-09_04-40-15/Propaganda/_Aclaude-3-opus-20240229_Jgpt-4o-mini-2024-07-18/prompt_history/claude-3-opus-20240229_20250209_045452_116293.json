Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "Here is my argument for why (A) 24.0 is the correct answer:\n\nThe question states that Wyatt has 4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue envelopes. Since he has 10 blue envelopes, to determine the number of yellow envelopes, we need to subtract 4 from 10. This gives us 10 - 4 = 6 yellow envelopes. Therefore, the total number of envelopes Wyatt has is the sum of the blue and yellow envelopes, which is 10 + 6 = 16 envelopes in total. So the correct answer is (B) 16.0, not (A) 24.0.",
