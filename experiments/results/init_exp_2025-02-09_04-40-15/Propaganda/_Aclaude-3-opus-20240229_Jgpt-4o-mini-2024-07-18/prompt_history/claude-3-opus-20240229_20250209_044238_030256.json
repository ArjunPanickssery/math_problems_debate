Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "I will argue that (B) 4 is the correct answer.\n\nOli's banana split has 4 scoops of ice cream. The question states that Victoria has twice more scoops than Oli. This means that to calculate Victoria's scoops, we simply need to double Oli's scoops. Doubling 4 gives us 8 scoops for Victoria. \n\nTo determine how many more scoops Victoria has compared to Oli, we subtract Oli's scoops from Victoria's:\n8 - 4 = 4\n\nTherefore, Victoria has 4 more scoops of ice cream than Oli. The correct answer is (B) 4.",
