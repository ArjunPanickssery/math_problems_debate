Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "Here is my argument for why 60% is the correct answer:\n\nThe original price of the dress was $350. Asia paid $140 for it on sale. To calculate the percentage discount, we need to find the amount saved and divide it by the original price. Asia saved $350 - $140 = $210. Dividing the savings by the original price gives us the discount percentage: $210 / $350 = 0.60, which is equivalent to a 60% discount. Therefore, Asia got the dress at a 60% discount off the original price.",
