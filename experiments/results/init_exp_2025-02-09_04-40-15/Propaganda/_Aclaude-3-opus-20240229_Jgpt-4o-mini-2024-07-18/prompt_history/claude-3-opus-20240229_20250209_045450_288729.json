Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

          "content": "Here is my argument for answer (A):\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to realize that the 20% of broken crayons refers to 20% of the remaining crayons after the new ones are accounted for, not 20% of the total. First, we calculate that 1/3 of the 120 total crayons are new, which is 40 crayons. That leaves 80 crayons remaining. Of those 80 remaining crayons, 20% are broken. 20% of 80 is 16 crayons. Finally, the slightly used crayons are what's left of the 80 after subtracting the 16 broken ones, which is 64 crayons. Therefore, 64 of the crayons are slightly used.",
