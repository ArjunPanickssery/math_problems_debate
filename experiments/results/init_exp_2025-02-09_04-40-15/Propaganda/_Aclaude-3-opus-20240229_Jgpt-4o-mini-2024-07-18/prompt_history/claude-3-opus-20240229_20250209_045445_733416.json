Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

Since he ate 1 bag for dinner, after dinner he ate 2 * 1 = 2 more bags. In total, he ate the 1 bag from dinner plus the 2 bags after dinner, which is 1 + 2 = 3 bags of chips total.",
