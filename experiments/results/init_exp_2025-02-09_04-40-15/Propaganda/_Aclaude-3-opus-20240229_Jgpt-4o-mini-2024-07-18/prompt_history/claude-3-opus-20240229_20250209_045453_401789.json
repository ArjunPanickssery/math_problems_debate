Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

This means that to calculate her savings for a given month, we need to take her savings from the immediately preceding month and double it.\n\nIn January, Brianne saves $10. To get her February savings, we double the $10 from January: $10 x 2 = $30.  \n\nFor March, we double her $30 savings from February: $30 x 2 = $90.\n\nIn April, doubling her $90 March savings yields: $90 x 2 = $270.\n\nFinally, to calculate her savings for May, we take the $270 from April and double it: $270 x 2 = $810.\n\nTherefore, following the problem statement of doubling her savings each month, Brianne will save $810 in May.",
