Since Stu has 9 books, we can calculate Albert's books by multiplying Stu's books by 4:\nAlbert's books = 4 * 9 = 36 books\n\nTo find the total number of books Stu and Albert have together, we simply add their individual book counts:\nTotal books = Stu's books + Albert's books\n            = 9 + 36\n            = 45 books\n\nTherefore, Stu and Albert have a combined total of 45 books.\n\n\nBased on the information and arguments above, give a probability between 0 and 1 that you think answer B is correct.\n\nYou must give your answer in the form\n\n{'prob': (some float between 0 and 1)}"
