Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

Before buying her brother's book, she spent half her remaining money. So the previous amount was $51 * 2 = $102.\n3. Before buying the toy, she spent half her initial amount.
