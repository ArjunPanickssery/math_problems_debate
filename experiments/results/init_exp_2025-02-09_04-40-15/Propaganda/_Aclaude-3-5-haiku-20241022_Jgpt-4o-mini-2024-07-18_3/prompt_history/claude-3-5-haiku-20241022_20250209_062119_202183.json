Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

First, I'll verify the algebraic solution using the math_eval function to check each calculation.\n\nLet x be the initial number of soda cans Tim had. After Jeff takes 6 cans, Tim is left with x - 6 cans. Then Tim buys half the remaining amount, which is (x - 6)/2.\n\nLet's set up the equation: x - 6 + (x - 6)/2 = 24",
