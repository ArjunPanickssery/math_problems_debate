Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

Maria buys 3 dozens of flowers, which means 3 x 12 = 36 regular flowers\n2. For each dozen, she gets 2 free flowers, so 3 x 2 = 6 free flowers\n3. Initially, this brings her total to 36 + 6 = 42 flowers\n4. However, the key detail is the additional 2 free flowers for the total purchase, which brings her final total to 42 + 2 = 44 flowers\n\nLet me verify the math:",
