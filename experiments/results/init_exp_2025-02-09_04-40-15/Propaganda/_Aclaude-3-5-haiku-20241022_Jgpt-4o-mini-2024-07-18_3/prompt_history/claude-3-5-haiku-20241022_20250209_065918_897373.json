Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100\n(B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25</question>\n<your_answer></your_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"
