Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument."

How many pieces of rope will he need to buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet\nHe loses 20*.25=5 feet each time\nSo he gets 20-5=15 feet from each piece\nThat means he needs 60/15=4 pieces of rope\n#### 4\n(A): 3.0\nHe needs 10*6=60 feet of rope total\nEach piece of rope is 20 feet\nTherefore he needs 60/20=3 pieces of rope\n#### 3</question>\n<your_answer></your_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"
