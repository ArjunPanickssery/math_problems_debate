Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

He starts at 100 feet elevation and ends at 1450 feet elevation, which means his total vertical climb is 1350 feet (1450 - 100 = 1350). \n\nLet's verify the horizontal distance calculation:",
