Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The calculation is straightforward multiplication: 10 bags per trip \u00d7 20 trips per day \u00d7 5 days = 1000 bags. The key is to multiply the number of bags per trip by the number of trips per day, and then by the number of days worked. This simple arithmetic shows that 1000 bags is the correct total number of bags delivered in 5 days.",
