Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "Jack bought a squat rack for $2500, and the barbell costs 1/10 of that price. To calculate the total cost, I'll simply add the two amounts together. The barbell's price is $2500 \u00f7 10 = $250. When I add the squat rack price ($2500) and the barbell price ($250), the total comes to $2750. This straightforward calculation follows the problem's instructions directly: find the cost of the barbell by dividing the squat rack price by 10, then add that to the original price. The math is clear and precise, leading to the answer of $2750.",
