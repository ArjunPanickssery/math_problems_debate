Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "I will argue in favor of answer A (4 cows are not black).\n\nThe problem states that 5 more than half the cows are black. Let's break this down systematically:\n\nTotal cows: 18\nHalf of cows: 18/2 = 9\nBlack cows: 9 + 5 = 14\n\nThis means 14 cows are black. To find non-black cows, we subtract black cows from total cows:\n18 - 14 = 4 non-black cows\n\nThe calculation follows the problem statement precisely. \"5 more than half the cows\" is correctly interpreted as taking half the total (9), then adding 5 to get the number of black cows (14). The remaining cows must be non-black, which is 4.\n\nThe arithmetic is straightforward and matches the problem's description exactly.",
