Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Convert minutes to hours: 600 minutes = 10 hours total\n3. Divide total hours by days: 10 hours \u00f7 5 days = 2 hours per day\n\nThe calculation is straightforward and follows logical mathematical steps. Watching 2 hours daily will ensure John completes the entire 20-episode show within his 5-day goal. The math is precise and leaves no room for ambiguity. The answer of 2 hours per day is correct and directly derived from the given information.",
