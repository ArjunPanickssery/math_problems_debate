Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "I'll argue strongly for answer B (4.5 hours):\n\nThe key to solving this problem is carefully tracking the length of each CD. Two CDs are 1.5 hours long each, which means their combined length is 3 hours. The third CD is twice the length of the shorter CDs, which means it's 3 hours long. When we add the two shorter CDs (1.5 + 1.5 = 3 hours) and the longer CD (3 hours), we get a total of 4.5 hours. The calculation is straightforward: 1.5 + 1.5 + 3 = 4.5. This precise breakdown shows that 4.5 hours is the correct total length of all three CDs. The previous argument erroneously double-counted the shorter CDs, leading to an incorrect total.",
