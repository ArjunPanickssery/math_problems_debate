Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The solution is clearly 8 bars. When 12 chocolate bars are divided equally among 3 people, each person receives 4 bars. Mike and Rita together would therefore get 4 + 4 = 8 bars. The problem statement specifically asks how many bars Mike and Rita got combined, which is straightforward to calculate by adding their individual shares. The arithmetic is simple: 12 \u00f7 3 = 4, and 4 + 4 = 8. The answer of 4 bars would only make sense if we were asking about a single person's share, not the combined share of Mike and Rita. Therefore, 8 bars is the correct and most logical answer.",
