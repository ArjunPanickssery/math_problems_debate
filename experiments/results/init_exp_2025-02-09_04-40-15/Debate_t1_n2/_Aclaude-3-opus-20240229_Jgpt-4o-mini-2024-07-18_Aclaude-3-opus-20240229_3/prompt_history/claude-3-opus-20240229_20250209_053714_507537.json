Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The question states that for every dozen flowers bought, the customer gets 2 free flowers. Maria is buying 3 dozens, so she should get 2 free flowers for each dozen purchased, which is a total of 6 free flowers (3 x 2 = 6). However, the question does not mention any additional free flowers for the total purchase. Therefore, the total number of flowers Maria will have is the 36 she purchased (3 dozens x 12 flowers per dozen = 36) plus the 6 free flowers she gets for buying 3 dozens, which equals 42 flowers in total. Answer (A) is correct, and the last step in the calculation for answer (B) is extraneous and not supported by the information given in the question.",
