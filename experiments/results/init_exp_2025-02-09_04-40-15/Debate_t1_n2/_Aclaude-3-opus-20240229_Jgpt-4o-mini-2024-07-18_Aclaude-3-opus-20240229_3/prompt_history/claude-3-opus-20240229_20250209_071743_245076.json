Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Since she is twice as fast as Lexie, and Lexie takes 20 minutes per mile, we can calculate Celia's time per mile by multiplying Lexie's time by 2.\n\nOnce we have Celia's time per mile, we can multiply that by the total distance of 30 miles to get the total time.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations, but all the necessary information is already provided in the question. No additional tools are needed.\n</thinking>\n\nSince Celia runs twice as fast as Lexie, and it takes Lexie 20 minutes to run a mile, that means it takes Celia 20 * 2 = 40 minutes to run a mile.\n\nTo calculate how long it will take Celia to run 30 miles at this pace, we simply multiply her time per mile by the total distance:",
