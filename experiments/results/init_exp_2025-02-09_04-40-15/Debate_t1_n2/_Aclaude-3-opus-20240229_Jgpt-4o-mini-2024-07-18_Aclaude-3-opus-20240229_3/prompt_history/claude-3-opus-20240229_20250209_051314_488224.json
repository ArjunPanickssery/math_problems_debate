Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question states that for every dozen flowers bought, the customer gets 2 free flowers. Maria is buying 3 dozen flowers.\n\nTo calculate the total number of flowers Maria will have:\n1. Calculate the number of flowers in 3 dozen (without the free ones)\n   - 1 dozen = 12 flowers\n   - 3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 flowers\n2. Calculate the number of free flowers Maria gets for buying 3 dozen\n   - For each dozen, she gets 2 free flowers \n   - For 3 dozen, she gets 3 * 2 = 6 free flowers\n3. Add the number of flowers bought and the free flowers\n   - Total flowers = Flowers bought + Free flowers\n   - Total flowers = 36 + 6 = 42\n\nThe math_eval tool is not needed here as the calculations are straightforward.\n</thinking>\n\nThe correct answer is (A) 42 flowers. Here's why:\n\nWhen Maria buys 3 dozen flowers, she is buying 36 flowers in total (3 * 12 = 36). \n\nAdditionally, for each dozen bought, she gets 2 free flowers. Since she bought 3 dozen, she gets 6 free flowers in total (3 * 2 = 6).\n\nTherefore, the total number of flowers Maria will have is the sum of the flowers she bought (36) and the free flowers she got (6), which equals 42.\n\nThe answer (B) 44 is incorrect because it double counts the free flowers. It first adds the 2 free flowers per dozen to get 42, but then incorrectly adds another 2 free flowers to the total, which is not stated in the problem.",
