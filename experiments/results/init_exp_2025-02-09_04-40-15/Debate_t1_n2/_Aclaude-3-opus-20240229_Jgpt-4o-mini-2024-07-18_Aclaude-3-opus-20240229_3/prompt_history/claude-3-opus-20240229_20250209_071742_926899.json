Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

So together they are consuming 2 apples per day.\nTo get the number of weeks, we can divide the total apples by the apples eaten per week:\n42 apples / (2 apples per day * 7 days per week) \nThis can be simplified to:\n42 apples / 14 apples per week\nTo do this calculation, we can use the math_eval tool.\n</thinking>",
