Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question provides Garret's current age (12) and states that 20 years ago, Shane was 2 times older than Garret is now. To determine Shane's current age, we first need to calculate Shane's age 20 years ago by multiplying Garret's current age by 2. Then we add 20 years to that result to get Shane's current age.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The required expr parameter can be inferred from the given information.\n\nTo calculate Shane's age 20 years ago:\nexpr: 12 * 2\n\nTo calculate Shane's current age by adding 20 years:\nexpr: previous_result + 20\n\nBoth required parameters can be reasonably inferred, so the math_eval tool can be used to answer the question without asking for additional information.\n</thinking>",
