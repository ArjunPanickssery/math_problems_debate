Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Find how many books Katie has based on Darla's book count\n2. Add Darla and Katie's books together \n3. Multiply that sum by 5 to get Gary's book count\n4. Add Darla, Katie and Gary's books together for the total\n\nThe question provides all the necessary information to perform these steps, so no additional tools or information are needed. We can proceed with the calculation.\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the question, Katie has half as many books as Darla. Since Darla has 6 books, that means Katie has 6/2 = 3 books.\n\nDarla and Katie together have 6 + 3 = 9 books. \n\nThe question states that Gary has 5 times the number of books that Darla and Katie have combined. So to calculate Gary's books, we take Darla and Katie's combined total of 9 books and multiply by 5:\n\n9 * 5 = 45\n\nTherefore, Gary has 45 books.\n\nTo get the total number of books the three have together, we add up each of their book counts:\n\nDarla: 6\nKatie: 3 \nGary: 45\n\n6 + 3 + 45 = 54\n\nSo the total number of books that Darla, Katie and Gary have is 54, which matches answer choice (A).",
