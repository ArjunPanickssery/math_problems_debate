Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key steps to solve this problem are:\n1. Find how many marbles Katrina has, since Mabel's marbles are given in terms of Katrina's.\n2. Find how many marbles Amanda has, since it's given in terms of Katrina's marbles plus 12.\n3. Subtract Amanda's marbles from Mabel's to get the difference.\n\nMy assigned answer is (A), which follows these steps:\n1. Katrina has 85/5 = 17 marbles\n2. Amanda needs 12 more than twice Katrina's marbles. Twice Katrina's is 17*2=34. So Amanda has 34-12 = 22 marbles. \n3. Mabel has 85 marbles. The difference is 85 - 22 = 63\n\nThe math checks out for my answer. I don't see any errors in the reasoning or calculations.\n</thinking>\n\nThe problem states that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many as Katrina. This means that if we find twice Katrina's marbles and subtract 12, we'll get the number of marbles Amanda currently has.\n\nWe're told Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina, and that Mabel has 85 marbles total. So Katrina must have 85/5 = 17 marbles. \n\nTwice Katrina's marbles is 17 * 2 = 34. \nAmanda has 12 less than that, so 34 - 12 = 22 marbles.\n\nFinally, Mabel has 85 marbles and Amanda has 22.
