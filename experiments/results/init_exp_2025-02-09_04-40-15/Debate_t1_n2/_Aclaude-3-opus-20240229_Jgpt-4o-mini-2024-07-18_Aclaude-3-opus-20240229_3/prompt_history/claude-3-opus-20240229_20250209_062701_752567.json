Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The key information provided is:\n- On Wednesday, 37 students played kickball\n- On Thursday, 9 fewer students played kickball compared to Wednesday\n\nTo calculate the total number of students, we need to:\n1. Find the number of students who played on Thursday\n2. Add the number of students who played on Wednesday and Thursday\n\nThe math_eval tool can be used to perform the necessary calculations. The required parameters are:\n- For step 1: expr = \"37 - 9\" (to find the number of students who played on Thursday)\n- For step 2: expr = \"37 + 28\" (to find the total number of students, assuming 28 played on Thursday)\n\nBoth parameters can be inferred from the given information, so no additional input is needed from the user.\n</thinking>",
