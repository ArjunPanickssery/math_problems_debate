Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The number of slightly used crayons (total minus new minus broken)\n\nThe key difference between the two answers is whether the 20% of broken crayons is calculated from the total 120 crayons or from the 80 remaining crayons after subtracting the new ones.\n\nTo calculate percentages and do the other math operations, I can use the math_eval tool.\n</thinking>",
