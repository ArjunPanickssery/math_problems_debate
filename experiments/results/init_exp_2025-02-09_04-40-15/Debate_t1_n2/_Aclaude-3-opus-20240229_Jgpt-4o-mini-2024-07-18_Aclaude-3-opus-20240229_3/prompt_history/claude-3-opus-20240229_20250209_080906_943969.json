Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The question specifically asks about the number of insects remaining. \nTo make this argument, I don't need to use any of the provided tools. The information given in the question and the definition of insects is sufficient.\n</thinking>\n\nWhile the other answer includes spiders in the total count, this is incorrect because spiders are not insects. Spiders are arachnids, a separate class from insects. The question specifically asks how many insects are remaining. \n\nIf we exclude the 3 spiders, as we should, and just count the ants and ladybugs, we get:\n12 ants + 6 ladybugs (8 originally minus the 2 that flew away) = 18 total insects\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that there are 18 insects remaining in the playground.",
