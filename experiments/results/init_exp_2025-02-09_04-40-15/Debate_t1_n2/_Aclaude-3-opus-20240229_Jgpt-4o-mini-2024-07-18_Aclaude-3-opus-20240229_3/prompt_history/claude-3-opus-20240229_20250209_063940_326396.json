Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question is asking how much money Isabel had at first, given that she spent half of it on a toy, then half of the remaining amount on a book for her brother, and ended up with $51 left.\n\nTo solve this, we can work backwards from the $51 she has left:\n- If $51 is half of what she had before buying the book, then before buying the book she had $51 * 2 = $102\n- If $102 is half of what she had before buying the toy, then before buying the toy she had $102 * 2 = $204\n\nSo the two possible answers are:\n(A) $408 \n(B) $204\n\nI need to argue that (B) $204 is the correct answer, even though (A) $408 seems more correct to me. \n</thinking>\n\nIsabel had $204 at first, not $408. Here's why:\n\nAfter Isabel spent half her money on the toy, she had half of her original amount left. Let's call her original amount x. So after buying the toy she had 0.5x left.\n\nShe then spent half of that 0.5x on her brother's book. Half of 0.5x is 0.25x. \n\nSo the amount she has left at the end is 0.5x - 0.25x = 0.25x\n\nWe're told she has $51 left at the end. So:\n0.25x = 51\nx = 51 / 0.25\nx = 51 * 4 \nx = 204\n\nTherefore, Isabel's original amount was $204, so (B) is correct.",
