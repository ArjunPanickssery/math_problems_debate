Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Calculate the total number of students in the Biology class (which is half of the Physics class)\n2. Determine what fraction of the Biology class is boys, given the 3:1 girl to boy ratio\n3. Calculate the number of boys by multiplying the total Biology students by the fraction that are boys\n\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful for steps 1 and 3 to perform the calculations. All the necessary information is provided in the question, so no additional tools or information are needed.\n</thinking>",
