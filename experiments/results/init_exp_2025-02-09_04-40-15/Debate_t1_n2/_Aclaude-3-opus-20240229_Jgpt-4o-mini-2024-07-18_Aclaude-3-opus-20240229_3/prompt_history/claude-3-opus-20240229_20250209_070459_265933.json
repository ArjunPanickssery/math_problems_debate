          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key to this problem is calculating how much Brianne saves each month based on the pattern given. We're told she saves $10 in January, and each subsequent month she saves twice as much as the previous month.\n\nTo calculate the savings for each month leading up to May:\nJanuary: $10 (given)\nFebruary: $10 * 2 = $20\nMarch: $20 * 2 = $40 \nApril: $40 * 2 = $80\nMay: $80 * 2 = $160\n\nSo the correct answer should be $160 for her May savings. Answer B provides the correct calculation.\n\nAnswer A makes an error - it adds $20 each month instead of doubling the previous month's amount. This leads to the incorrect final value of $810.\n</thinking>\n\nAnswer B is correct. Brianne starts with $10 in January savings. The problem states that each month, she saves twice as much as the previous month. \n\nFollowing this pattern:\nIn February, she saves $10 * 2 = $20\nIn March, she saves $20 * 2 = $40\nIn April, it's $40 * 2 = $80 \nFinally in May, she will save $80 * 2 = $160\n\nThe calculation in Answer B follows the problem statement exactly, doubling the previous month's savings each time to arrive at $160 for May.",
