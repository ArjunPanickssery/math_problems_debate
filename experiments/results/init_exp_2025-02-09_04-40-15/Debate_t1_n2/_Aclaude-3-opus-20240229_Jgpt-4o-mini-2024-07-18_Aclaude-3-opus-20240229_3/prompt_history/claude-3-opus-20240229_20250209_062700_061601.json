Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The key information provided is:\n- Total chickens: 325\n- Number of roosters: 28\n- Number of non-laying hens: 20\n\nTo calculate the number of egg-laying hens, we first need to find the total number of hens by subtracting the roosters from the total chickens. Then we can subtract the non-laying hens from that total to get the number of egg-laying hens.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations, with the following steps:\n1. Calculate total hens: 325 - 28\n2. Calculate egg-laying hens: [output of step 1] - 20\n\nAll the required parameters for math_eval are available, so we can proceed with the tool calls in that order.\n</thinking>",
