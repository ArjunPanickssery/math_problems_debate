Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many marbles Katrina has (can be determined from Mabel's marble count)\n2. How many marbles Amanda has (can be determined once we know Katrina's marble count)\n\nThen we can subtract Amanda's marbles from Mabel's to get the difference.\n\nNo tools are needed, as the question provides all the necessary information and only requires basic arithmetic that can be done manually.\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the information given, Mabel has 85 marbles, and this is 5 times as many marbles as Katrina has. Therefore, we can determine that Katrina has 85 \u00f7 5 = 17 marbles.\n\nThe question also states that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. Since Katrina has 17 marbles, twice this amount would be 17 \u00d7 2 = 34 marbles. And since Amanda needs 12 more marbles to reach this amount, we can calculate that Amanda currently has 34 - 12 = 22 marbles.\n\nFinally, to determine how many more marbles Mabel has compared to Amanda, we simply subtract:\nMabel's marbles - Amanda's marbles\n85 - 22 = 63\n\nTherefore, Mabel has 63 more marbles than Amanda.",
