Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Since each ticket costs $4, we can calculate the total number of tickets sold by dividing the total revenue by the price per ticket:\n\n$960 / $4 per ticket = 240 total tickets sold\n\nTo find the average number of tickets sold per day, we then divide the total tickets sold by the number of days:\n\n240 tickets / 3 days = 80 tickets per day on average\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Carol sold an average of 80 tickets per day over the three day period.",
