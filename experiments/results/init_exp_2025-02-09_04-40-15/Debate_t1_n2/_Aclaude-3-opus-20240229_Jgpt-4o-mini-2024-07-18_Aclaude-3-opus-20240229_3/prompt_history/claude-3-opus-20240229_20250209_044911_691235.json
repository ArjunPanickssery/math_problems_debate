Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The calculation in answer choice (B) incorrectly subtracts 6 inches from Logan's hair length to get Emily's length, which is the opposite of what the question states.\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the information provided in the question, Emily's hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's hair. Since we are told Logan's hair is 20 inches long, to calculate the length of Emily's hair we need to add 6 inches to Logan's hair length:",
