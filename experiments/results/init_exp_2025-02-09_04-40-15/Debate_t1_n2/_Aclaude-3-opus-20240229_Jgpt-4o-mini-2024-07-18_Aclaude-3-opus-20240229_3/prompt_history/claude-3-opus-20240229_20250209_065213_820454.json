Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The parameters needed are:\nexpr: The expression to evaluate. In this case, it would be the calculation to determine the price Maria paid for the ticket with the 40% discount.\n\nTo calculate the discounted price, we need to multiply the original price by the percentage of the price Maria is paying (100% - 40% = 60%).\n\nSo the expression to evaluate would be: 15 * 0.6\n\nThis provides all the necessary information to make the math_eval tool call.\n</thinking>",
