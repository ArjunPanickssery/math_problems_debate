Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Here's why:\n\nThe question states that the regular price of each book is $5. When Sheryll bought the books, she was given a discount of $0.5 per book. A discount means the price is reduced, so we need to add the $0.5 discount to the $5 regular price to get the price Sheryll actually paid per book:\n\n$5 regular price + $0.5 discount = $5.5 per book\n\nSheryll bought 10 books total. So to calculate her total cost, we multiply the $5.5 price per book by the 10 books she purchased:  \n\n$5.5 per book * 10 books = $55 total\n\nTherefore, the total amount Sheryll paid for the 10 books, with the $0.5 per book discount applied, was $55.",
