Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Add the height gain to John's original height to get his new height in inches\n3. Convert the new height from inches to feet\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform the calculations in steps 1 and 2. Converting inches to feet in step 3 is a simple division that doesn't require a tool.\n\nAll the information needed is provided in the question, so no additional tools or clarification from the user are needed.\n</thinking>",
