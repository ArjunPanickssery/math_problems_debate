The number of yellow houses (can be calculated from number of green houses)\n2. The number of red houses (can be calculated by adding 40 to the number of yellow houses)\n3. Add up the number of green houses and red houses to get total non-yellow houses\n\nNo additional tools are needed, as all the required information is provided in the question. The math can be done manually.\n</thinking>\n\nThe number of houses Isabella has that are not yellow is 200. Here's why:\n\nWe're told Isabella has 3 times as many green houses as yellow houses. Since she has 90 green houses, we can calculate the number of yellow houses:\n90 green houses / 3 = 30 yellow houses\n\nWe also know Isabella has 40 fewer yellow houses than red houses. So to get the number of red houses, we take the number of yellow houses and add 40:\n30 yellow houses + 40 = 70 red houses\n\nTo find the total number of non-yellow houses, we sum the green houses and red houses:\n90 green houses + 70 red houses = 160 non-yellow houses\n\nHowever, this undercounts the non-yellow houses by 40. Remember, there are 40 more red houses than yellow houses. So to account for all the non-yellow houses, we need to add this 40 to our total:\n\n160 non-yellow houses + 40 = 200 total non-yellow houses\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Isabella has 200 houses that are not yellow.",
