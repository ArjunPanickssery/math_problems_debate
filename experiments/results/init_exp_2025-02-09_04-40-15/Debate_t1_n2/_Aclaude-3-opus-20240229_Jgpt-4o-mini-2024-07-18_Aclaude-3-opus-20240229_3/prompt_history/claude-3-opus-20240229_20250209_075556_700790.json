Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The question states that 5 more than half the cows are black. To find the number of black cows, we first calculate half of the total cows: 18/2 = 9. Then, we add 5 to this number to get the number of black cows: 9 + 5 = 14. Since there are 18 cows in total, and 14 of them are black, the number of non-black cows is simply the difference: 18 - 14 = 4. Therefore, the correct answer is (A): 4 cows are not black.",
