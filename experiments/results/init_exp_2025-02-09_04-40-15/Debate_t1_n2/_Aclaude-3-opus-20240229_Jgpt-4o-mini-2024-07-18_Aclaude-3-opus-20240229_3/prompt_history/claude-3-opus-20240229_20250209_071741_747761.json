Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key points in the question are:\n- The school choir has 30 singers total\n- They currently have 12 robes\n- Each robe costs $2\n- We need to calculate how much the school will spend to buy the rest of the robes needed\n\nTo determine the cost, we first need to calculate how many additional robes are needed. This can be done by subtracting the number of robes they already have from the total number of singers.\n\n30 singers - 12 existing robes = 18 additional robes needed\n\nOnce we have the number of additional robes needed, we can multiply that by the cost per robe to get the total amount the school will spend.\n\n18 additional robes * $2 per robe = $36 total cost\n\nSo the math_eval tool could be used to perform this final calculation and confirm the $36 result matches the answer I've been assigned to argue for.\n</thinking>",
