Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key to solving this problem is to carefully read the question and add up the number of eggs in each nest. The question mentions:\n- 2 nests in 1 tree with 5 eggs each \n- 1 nest in another tree with 3 eggs\n- 1 nest in the front yard with 4 eggs\nTo calculate the total, I'll need to:\n1. Multiply the 5 eggs per nest by the 2 nests in the first tree\n2. Add the 3 eggs from the second tree nest \n3. Add the 4 eggs from the front yard nest\nNo tools are needed, as the problem can be solved with simple arithmetic based on the information provided in the question.\n</thinking>\n\nThe correct answer is (B) 17 eggs total. Here's why:\n\nIn the first tree, there are 2 nests that each contain 5 eggs. To find the total eggs in that tree, we multiply:\n2 nests * 5 eggs per nest = 10 eggs \n\nThen we have 1 nest in a second tree with 3 eggs, and 1 nest in the front yard with 4 eggs.\n\nTo get the grand total, we sum the eggs from each location:\n10 eggs (from first tree) + 3 eggs (from second tree) + 4 eggs (from front yard) = 17 eggs total\n\nTherefore, June found a total of 17 birds eggs, making (B) the correct answer.",
