Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Calculate the number of noodles based on the number of pirates\n2. Add the number of noodles and pirates together\nThe question states there are 7 fewer noodles than pirates. Since we know there are 45 pirates, to calculate the number of noodles we take the number of pirates (45) and add 7 to it. This gives us the number of noodles.\nThen to get the total, we add the number of noodles to the number of pirates (45).\nNo tools are needed, as the question can be answered with basic arithmetic that I can do myself.\n</thinking>\n\nThere are 45 pirates in the matrix. The question states that there are 7 fewer noodles than pirates. So to calculate the number of noodles, we take the number of pirates (45) and add 7 to it:\n\n45 pirates + 7 = 52 noodles\n\nNow that we know there are 52 noodles and 45 pirates, we can add those together to get the total:\n\n52 noodles + 45 pirates = 97 total\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that there are 97 noodles and pirates in total in the matrix.",
