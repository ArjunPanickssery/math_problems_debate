Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 12.0 centimeters. Here's why:\n\nThere were 7 Mondays, and on each Monday it rained 1.5 centimeters. So the total rainfall on Mondays was:\n7 * 1.5 = 10.5 centimeters\n\nThere were 9 Tuesdays, and on each Tuesday it rained 2.5 centimeters. So the total rainfall on Tuesdays was: \n9 * 2.5 = 22.5 centimeters\n\nTo find how many more centimeters it rained on Tuesdays than Mondays, we subtract the total Monday rainfall from the total Tuesday rainfall:\n22.5 - 10.5 = 12 centimeters\n\nTherefore, it rained 12 centimeters more in total on Tuesdays compared to Mondays. The approach in (B) only looks at the per-day difference, not the total difference.",
