Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

This can be calculated by multiplying the number of classes by the number of students per class.\n\nOnce we have the total number of students, we can multiply that by the number of packs bought per student to get the final answer.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The required parameters are:\nexpr: the mathematical expression to evaluate\n\nWe have all the information needed to construct the expression, so we can proceed with the tool call.\n</thinking>",
