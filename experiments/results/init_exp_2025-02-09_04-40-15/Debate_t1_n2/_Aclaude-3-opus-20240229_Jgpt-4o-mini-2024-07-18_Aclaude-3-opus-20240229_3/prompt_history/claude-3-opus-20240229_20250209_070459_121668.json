Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The math_eval tool could be used to perform the calculations, but they are simple enough to do without a tool.\n</thinking>\n\nJohn started at an elevation of 100 feet and ended at an elevation of 1450 feet. Therefore, the total vertical distance he traveled is:\n\n1450 feet - 100 feet = 1350 feet\n\nSince John travels 1 foot vertically for every 2 feet horizontally, to calculate his horizontal distance we multiply the vertical distance by 2:\n\n1350 feet * 2 = 2700 feet\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) - John traveled 2700 feet horizontally. The calculation in (B) incorrectly uses his final elevation rather than the change in elevation to determine the horizontal distance.",
