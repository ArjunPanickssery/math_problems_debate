Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The difference between the two yearly amounts\n\nFor the new job:\n- Hourly rate is $20\n- Works 40 hours per week\n- Works 52 weeks per year\nI can calculate the yearly amount as:\n20 * 40 * 52 = $41,600 per year\n\nFor the old job: \n- Hourly rate was $16\n- Worked 25 hours per week\n- Assuming also 52 weeks per year\nI can calculate the old yearly amount as:\n16 * 25 * 52 = $20,800 per year\n\nTo get the difference:\n41600 - 20800 = $20,800 more per year in the new job\n</thinking>\n\nThe correct answer is B, that Jame makes $20,800 more per year in his new job compared to his old job. \n\nHere's the calculation:\n\nIn his new job, Jame makes:\n$20 per hour * 40 hours per week * 52 weeks = $41,600 per year\n\nIn his old job, Jame made: \n$16 per hour * 25 hours per week * 52 weeks = $20,800 per year\n\nThe difference is:\n$41,600 - $20,800 = $20,800 more per year in the new job\n\nThe key is to calculate the full yearly amounts for each job based on the hourly rate, hours per week, and number of weeks worked per year. Simply looking at the difference in hourly rate or hours per week alone does not account for the full yearly difference.\n\nTherefore, answer choice B of $20,800 more per year is correct.",
