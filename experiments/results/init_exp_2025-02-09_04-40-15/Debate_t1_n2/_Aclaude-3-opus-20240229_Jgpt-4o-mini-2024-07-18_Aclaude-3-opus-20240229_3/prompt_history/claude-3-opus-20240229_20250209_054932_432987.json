Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The correct answer is 25 boys in the Biology class. Here's why:\n\nWe know the Physics class has 200 students, and the Biology class has half as many students as the Physics class. So the Biology class has 200/2 = 100 students total.\n\nThe question states there are three times as many girls as boys in the Biology class. Let's represent the number of boys as x. Then the number of girls is 3x. \n\nSince the total number of students is boys plus girls, we can write an equation:\nx + 3x = 100\n\nSimplifying:\n4x = 100\nx = 100/4 = 25\n\nTherefore, there are 25 boys in the Biology class.",
