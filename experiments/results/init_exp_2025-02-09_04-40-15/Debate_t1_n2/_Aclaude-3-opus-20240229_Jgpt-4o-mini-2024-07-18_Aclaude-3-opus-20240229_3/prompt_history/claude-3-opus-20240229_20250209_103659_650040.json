Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

But the question already accounts for James taking 20 trips each day when it states \"If he takes 20 trips a day\". There's no need to multiply by 20 again.\n\nIn 5 days, taking 20 trips per day carrying 10 bags each trip, James will deliver a total of 1000 bags, not 20000. The math clearly shows my answer of 1000 bags is correct.",
