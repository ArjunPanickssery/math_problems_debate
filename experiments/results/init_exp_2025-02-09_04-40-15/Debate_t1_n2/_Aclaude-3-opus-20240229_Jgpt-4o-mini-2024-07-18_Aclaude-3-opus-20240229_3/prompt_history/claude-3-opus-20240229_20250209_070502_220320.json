          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question asks how many total flowers Maria will have after buying 3 dozen flowers, given that for every dozen purchased, she gets 2 free flowers. \n\nTo calculate the total number of flowers, we need to:\n1. Calculate the number of flowers in 3 dozen (3 x 12 = 36)\n2. Calculate the number of free flowers for buying 3 dozen (3 x 2 = 6) \n3. Add the regular and free flowers together\n\nBoth answers do steps 1 and 2 correctly, arriving at 36 regular flowers and 6 free flowers. The key difference is that answer B then adds an extra 2 free flowers at the end, assuming you get 2 more free flowers for the total purchase on top of the per-dozen free flowers.\n\nHowever, the question states you get 2 free flowers for each dozen purchased, not an extra 2 for the total. So adding the extra 2 at the end is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, answer A which simply adds the 36 regular and 6 free flowers for a total of 42 appears to be the correct interpretation, while B's final step of adding 2 more is not supported by the information given.\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the problem statement, Maria gets 2 free flowers for each dozen purchased. Buying 3 dozen flowers at 12 flowers per dozen means she is purchasing 36 flowers (3 x 12 = 36). She then gets 2 free flowers per dozen, which is an additional 6 flowers (3 dozens x 2 free each = 6 free). \n\nSo the correct calculation is:\n36 purchased flowers + 6 free flowers = 42 total flowers\n\nThe problem does not state there are any additional free flowers beyond the 2 per dozen. So adding an extra 2 free flowers for the total purchase, as done in answer B, is not supported by the given information. The 42 flowers calculated in answer A represents the correct total based on a straightforward application of the pricing policy outlined in the question.",
