Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 8.0 square inches of the box are left uncovered. Here's why:\n\nThe shoebox has a length of 6 inches and a width of 4 inches. To find the total area of the shoebox, we multiply the length by the width: 6 inches \u00d7 4 inches = 24 square inches. This is the total area of the bottom of the shoebox.\n\nThe square block placed inside the shoebox has sides of 4 inches. To find the area of the block, we square the side length: 4 inches \u00d7 4 inches = 16 square inches. \n\nTo determine the uncovered area, we subtract the area of the block from the total area of the shoebox: 24 square inches - 16 square inches = 8 square inches.\n\nTherefore, 8 square inches of the shoebox are left uncovered by the block.",
