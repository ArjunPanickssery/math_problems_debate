Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How long the tree has been planted so far (current age - age when planted)\n2. How many more years until the tree bears fruit (7 years - years planted so far)\n3. Lydia's age when the tree bears fruit (current age + additional years needed)\n\nNo tools are needed as the question provides all the necessary information and only simple arithmetic is required. The correct answer can be calculated directly.\n</thinking>\n\nLydia planted the apple tree when she was 4 years old and is now 9. That means the tree has been growing for 9 - 4 = 5 years so far. \n\nWe know it takes a total of 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit. Since 5 years have passed, there are still 7 - 5 = 2 more years to go before Lydia's tree will produce apples.\n\nLydia is currently 9 years old. In 2 years when the apples are ready, she will be 9 + 2 = 11 years old. Therefore, Lydia will get to eat an apple from her tree for the first time when she is 11.",
