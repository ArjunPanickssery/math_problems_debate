Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The discount is subtracted from the original price, not added to it. When Sheryll buys 10 books at $5 each, the total original price would be $50. With a $0.5 discount per book, the total discount is $5. Therefore, Sheryll pays $50 - $5 = $45 for the 10 books. The calculation in Answer A is correct: $5 - $0.5 = $4.5 per book, and $4.5 \u00d7 10 = $45. This matches the mathematical logic of how discounts work - they reduce the total price, not increase it. The key is to subtract the discount from the original price, which Answer A does correctly.",
