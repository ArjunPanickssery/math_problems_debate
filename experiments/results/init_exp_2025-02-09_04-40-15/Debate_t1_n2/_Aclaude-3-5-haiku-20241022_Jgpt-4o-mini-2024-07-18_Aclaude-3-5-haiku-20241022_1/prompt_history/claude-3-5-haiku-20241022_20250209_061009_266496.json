Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The key is understanding the precise timeline of tree growth and Lydia's age. When Lydia was 4, she planted the tree. Now she's 9, which means the tree has already been growing for 5 years. Since it takes 7 total years for an apple tree to bear fruit, the tree needs only 2 more years to start producing. Therefore, when the tree first bears fruit, Lydia will be 11 years old (9 + 2). The calculation is straightforward: subtract the years already passed (5) from the total growth time (7), then add that remaining time to her current age. Answer A precisely tracks the tree's maturation and Lydia's age progression, making it the correct solution.",
