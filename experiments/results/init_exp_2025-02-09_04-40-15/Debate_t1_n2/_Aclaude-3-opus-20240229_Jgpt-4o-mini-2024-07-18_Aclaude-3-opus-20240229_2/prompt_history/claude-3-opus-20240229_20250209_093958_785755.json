Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Each watermelon weighs 23 pounds and is sold at $2 per pound, so the price per watermelon is 23 * $2 = $46. For 18 watermelons, the total revenue is then simply 18 * $46 = $828. \n\nThe key mistake in answer (B)'s reasoning is that it tries to account for the per-pound pricing a second time by multiplying the $828 by 2 again at the end. But the $2 per pound was already factored in when calculating the $46 price per watermelon. Multiplying by 2 again would be double counting the per-pound price.\n\nTherefore, the indisputable mathematical evidence proves that Farmer Kent would make $828 in revenue by selling the 18 watermelons, as stated in answer (A). Answer (B) contains a clear error and can be definitively ruled out.",
