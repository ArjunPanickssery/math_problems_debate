Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

To calculate the percentage off, we need to know the original price and the sale price.\n\nOriginal price: $350 (given)\nSale price: $140 (given)\n\nWith these values, we can calculate:\nDifference = Original price - Sale price\nPercentage off = Difference / Original price * 100\n\nSo we have the required parameters to use math_eval to calculate the percentage.\n</thinking>",
