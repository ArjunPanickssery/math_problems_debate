Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If their grandmother has 50 dolls, how many dolls do they have altogether?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 258.0\nIf the grandmother has 50 dolls, Rene's sister, who has 2 more dolls than their grandmother, has 50+2 = 52 dolls.\nTogether, Rene's sister and the grandmother have 52+50 = 102 dolls.\nSince Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, she has 52*3 = 156 dolls.\nAltogether, they have 156+102 = 258 dolls.\n#### 258\n(B): 658.0\nStarting with grandmother's 50 dolls, we first multiply by 3 to get 150.\nAdding 2 gives us the sister's number of dolls: 152.\nSince Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, she has 152*3 = 456 dolls.\nThe total number of dolls is therefore 50+152+456 = 658.\n#### 658</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"

Calculate how many dolls Rene's sister has based on the grandmother's doll count\n2. Calculate how many dolls Rene has based on her sister's doll count \n3. Sum the number of dolls each person has to get the total\n\nNo additional information is needed from the user to perform these steps.\n</thinking>\n\nThe grandmother has 50 dolls. Rene's sister has 2 more dolls than the grandmother, which means she has 50 + 2 = 52 dolls. \n\nRene has 3 times as many dolls as her sister. Since her sister has 52 dolls, Rene has 52 * 3 = 156 dolls.\n\nTo calculate the total, we sum each person's doll count:\n- Grandmother: 50 dolls\n- Rene's sister: 52 dolls \n- Rene: 156 dolls\n\n50 + 52 + 156 = 258\n\nTherefore, the total number of dolls altogether is 258, which matches answer choice (A).",
