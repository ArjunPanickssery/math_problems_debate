Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key to this question is determining the total time Jace spends driving. The question states that Jace drives for 4 hours, takes a 30 minute break, then drives for another 9 hours. \n\nTo calculate the distance, I need to:\n1. Sum the total driving time, which is 4 hours + 9 hours = 13 hours\n2. Multiply the total driving time by Jace's speed of 60 miles per hour\n\nI do not need to factor in the 30 minute break, because Jace is not driving any distance during that time.\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform the multiplication of total driving time by speed to get the final distance. The required \"expr\" parameter can be inferred as \"13 * 60\" based on the values given in the question and the total driving time I calculated.\n</thinking>",
