Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

She runs on 4 days - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Therefore, to calculate her average daily running distance, we should divide the total distance by the number of days she runs: 16 miles / 4 days = 4 miles per day on average. The calculation in answer B incorrectly divides by 7 days, but the question is specifically asking about the average on the days she runs, not the overall weekly average. So answer A of 4 miles per day is correct.",
