Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

To determine classes per semester, we divide the 40 total classes by 8 semesters, which equals 5 classes per semester. The calculation is straightforward: 120 credits / 3 credits per class / 8 semesters = 5 classes per semester. Taking 5 classes each semester will allow Maddy to earn the 120 credits required for graduation within the 8 semester timeframe.",
