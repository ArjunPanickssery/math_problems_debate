Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The Biology class has half as many students as the Physics class, which has 200 students. So the Biology class has 100 students total. \n\nLet x be the number of boys in the Biology class. Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls is 3x. The total number of students is then x + 3x = 4x. We know this total is 100, so we can set up the equation:\n\n4x = 100\n\nSolving for x:\nx = 100/4 = 25\n\nTherefore, there are 25 boys in the Biology class. The key is recognizing that the boys are 1/4 of the total, since the girls are 3 times the number of boys.",
