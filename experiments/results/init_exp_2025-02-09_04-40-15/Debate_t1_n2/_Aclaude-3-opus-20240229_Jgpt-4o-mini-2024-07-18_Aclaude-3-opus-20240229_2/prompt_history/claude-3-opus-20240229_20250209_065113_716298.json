Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Calculate the number of books Peter has read by multiplying the total books by 40% \n2. Calculate the number of books Peter's brother has read by multiplying the total books by 10%\n3. Subtract the number of books Peter's brother read from the number Peter read to get the difference\n\nThe math_eval tool can help with these percentage and subtraction calculations. All the required information is provided in the question, so no additional tools or information from the user are needed.\n</thinking>",
