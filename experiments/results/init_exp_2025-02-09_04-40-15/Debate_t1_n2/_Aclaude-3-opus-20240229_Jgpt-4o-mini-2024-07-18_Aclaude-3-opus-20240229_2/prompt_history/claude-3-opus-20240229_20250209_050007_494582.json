Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key to this question is calculating the total rainfall on Mondays and Tuesdays separately, and then finding the difference between those totals.\n\nTo calculate the total rainfall, I need to multiply the amount of rain per day by the number of days. \n\nFor Mondays, it rained 1.5 cm each day for 7 days. So I can calculate the total Monday rainfall with:\n1.5 * 7\n\nFor Tuesdays, it rained 2.5 cm each day for 9 days. So the total Tuesday rainfall is: \n2.5 * 9\n\nOnce I have the total rainfall for each day of the week, I can subtract the Monday total from the Tuesday total to get the difference.\n\nThe math_eval tool can handle these calculations. I have all the information I need to proceed with the tool calls.\n</thinking>",
