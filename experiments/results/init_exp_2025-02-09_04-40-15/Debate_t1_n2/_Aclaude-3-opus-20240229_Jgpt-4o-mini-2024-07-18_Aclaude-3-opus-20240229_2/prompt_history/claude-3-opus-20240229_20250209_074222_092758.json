Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The total number of students (number of classes * students per class)\n2. The total packs bought (total students * packs per student)\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations. The required parameter is the mathematical expression to evaluate.\n\nBased on the given information, the expression to calculate the total packs would be:\n6 * 30 * 2\n\nThis multiplies the number of classes by the students per class to get the total students, and then multiplies that by the packs per student to get the total packs bought.\n\nSo the math_eval tool with the expression \"6 * 30 * 2\" should give us the correct answer of 360 total packs. \n</thinking>",
