Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key information given is:\n- There are 3 times as many girls as boys in the Biology class\n- The Physics class has 200 students\n- The Biology class has half as many students as the Physics class\n\nTo calculate the number of boys in the Biology class, we first need to determine the total number of students in the Biology class. Since the Biology class has half as many students as the Physics class which has 200 students, the total number of students in the Biology class is 200/2 = 100.\n\nNow that we know the total number of students in the Biology class is 100, we can use the fact that there are 3 times as many girls as boys to set up an equation:\nLet x = number of boys\nThen 3x = number of girls\nx + 3x = 100\n4x = 100\nx = 100/4 = 25\n\nSo based on the given information, the number of boys in the Biology class is 25. This matches answer choice (A).\n</thinking>\n\nAnswer (A) is correct. Since there are 100 total students in the Biology class and the number of girls is 3 times the number of boys, we can let x represent the number of boys and set up the equation:\n\nx + 3x = 100\n4x = 100 \nx = 25\n\nTherefore, there are 25 boys in the Biology class.",
