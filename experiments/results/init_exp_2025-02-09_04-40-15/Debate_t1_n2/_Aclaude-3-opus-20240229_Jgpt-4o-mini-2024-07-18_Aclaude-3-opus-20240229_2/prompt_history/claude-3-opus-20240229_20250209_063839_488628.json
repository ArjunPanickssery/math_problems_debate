Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Since Celia is twice as fast as Lexie, and it takes Lexie 20 minutes per mile, it will take Celia half of that, or 10 minutes per mile.\n\nOnce we have Celia's time for 1 mile, we can multiply that by 30 to get her time for 30 miles. \n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform the calculation of 10 * 30 to get the final answer in minutes.\n</thinking>",
