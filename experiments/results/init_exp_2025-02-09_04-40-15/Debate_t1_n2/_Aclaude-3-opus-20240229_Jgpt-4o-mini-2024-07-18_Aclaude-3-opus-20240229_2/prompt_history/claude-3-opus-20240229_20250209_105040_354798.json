Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The question states Victoria has twice as many scoops as Oli, not that she has an additional 2 times Oli's amount. Twice as many means multiplying Oli's amount by 2, not adding.\n\nSo in conclusion, the correct answer is that Victoria has 4 more scoops of ice cream than Oli, not 8 more. The math clearly shows she has 8 total scoops, which is 4 more than Oli's 4 scoops.",
