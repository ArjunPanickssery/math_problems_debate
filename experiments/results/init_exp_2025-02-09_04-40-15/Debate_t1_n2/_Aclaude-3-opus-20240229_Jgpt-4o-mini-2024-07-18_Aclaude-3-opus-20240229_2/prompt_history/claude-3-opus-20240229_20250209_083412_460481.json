Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

To determine the total number of bags eaten, we need to:\n1. Determine how many bags he ate for dinner\n2. Calculate how many bags he ate after dinner based on the dinner amount\n3. Add the dinner and after dinner amounts together\nThe question provides the number of bags eaten for dinner directly (1 bag), so no additional tools are needed for step 1. For step 2, the after dinner amount can be calculated by multiplying the dinner amount by 2. The math_eval tool can handle this calculation. For step 3, the math_eval tool can also be used to add the two amounts together to get the total.\n</thinking>",
