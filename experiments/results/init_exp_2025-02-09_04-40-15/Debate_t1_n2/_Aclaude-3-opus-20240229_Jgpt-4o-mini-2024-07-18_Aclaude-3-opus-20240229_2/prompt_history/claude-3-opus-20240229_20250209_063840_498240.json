Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The question states that the number of hens is 5 less than 9 times the number of roosters. \n\nIf we let x = number of roosters, then:\nNumber of hens = 9x - 5\n\nThe total number of chickens is the sum of the number of hens and roosters:\nTotal chickens = Number of hens + Number of roosters\n75 = (9x - 5) + x\n\nThis simplifies to:\n75 = 10x - 5\n80 = 10x\nx = 8\n\nPlugging x = 8 back into the equation for the number of hens:\nNumber of hens = 9(8) - 5 = 67\n\nTherefore, answer choice (A) which states there are 67 hens is correct.\n</thinking>\n\nAnswer (A) is correct. The question states that the number of hens is 5 less than 9 times the number of roosters. If we let x equal the number of roosters, then the number of hens is represented by 9x - 5. \n\nThe total number of chickens is 75, which is the sum of the hens and roosters:\n75 = (9x - 5) + x\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n75 = 10x - 5\n80 = 10x\nx = 8\n\nThere are 8 roosters. Plugging this back into the expression for the number of hens:\nNumber of hens = 9(8) - 5 = 67\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) 67 hens.",
