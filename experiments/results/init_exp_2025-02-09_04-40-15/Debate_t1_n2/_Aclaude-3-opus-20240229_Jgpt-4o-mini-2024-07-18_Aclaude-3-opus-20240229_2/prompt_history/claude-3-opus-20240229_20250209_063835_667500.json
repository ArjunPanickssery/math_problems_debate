Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nTo argue that 32 is the correct answer, I will focus on the key details in the question:\n- There are 14 red crayons\n- There are 5 more blue crayons than red crayons\n- There are 6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons\nThe number of blue crayons can be calculated as 14 + 5 = 19. \nThe key point is interpreting the last statement correctly. It says there are 6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons. \nDouble the blue crayons is 19 * 2 = 38.\n6 less than 38 is 38 - 6 = 32.\nSo the correct number of yellow crayons, based on a precise reading of the question, is 32.\n</thinking>\n\nThe question clearly states that there are 6 less yellow crayons than double the number of blue crayons. We know there are 14 red crayons, and 5 more blue crayons than red. So the number of blue crayons is 14 + 5 = 19.\n\nDouble the number of blue crayons is 19 * 2 = 38. The question says there are 6 less yellow crayons than this double amount. Therefore, the number of yellow crayons is 38 - 6 = 32.\n\nThe other answer adds 6 to double the blue amount, but the question specifies 6 less, not 6 more. 32 yellow crayons is the logically correct answer based on the details provided in the question.",
