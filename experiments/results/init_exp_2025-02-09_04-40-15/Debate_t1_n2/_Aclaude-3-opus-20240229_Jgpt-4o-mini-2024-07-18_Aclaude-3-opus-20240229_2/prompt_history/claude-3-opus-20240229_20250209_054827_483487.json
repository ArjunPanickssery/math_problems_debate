Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

To find the number of yellow crayons, we first double the number of blue crayons: 19 x 2 = 38. Then, we subtract 6 from this total to get the number of yellow crayons: 38 - 6 = 32. Therefore, the correct answer is that there are 32 yellow crayons.",
