Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The question states that Victoria has twice more scoops than Oli, which means we need to add Oli's scoops to twice Oli's scoops to get Victoria's total. Oli has 4 scoops, so twice that is 8 scoops. Adding that to Oli's original 4 scoops gives Victoria a total of 12 scoops. Since Oli only has 4 scoops, Victoria has 8 more scoops than Oli, not just 4 more.",
