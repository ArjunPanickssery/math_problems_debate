Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The required parameters are:\nexpr: the mathematical expression to evaluate\n\nWe have the following information from the question to construct the expressions:\n- There are 14 red crayons \n- There are 5 more blue crayons than red crayons\n- There are 6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons\n\nTo find the number of blue crayons, we can use this expression:\n14 + 5\n\nTo find the number of yellow crayons, we can use this expression, where b is the number of blue crayons:\nb * 2 - 6\n\nSo the steps are:\n1.
