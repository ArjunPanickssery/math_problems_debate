Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The question states that Katie has 9 fewer orange marbles than pink marbles. Since she has 13 pink marbles, the correct way to calculate the number of orange marbles is 13 - 9 = 4. The explanation for answer choice A incorrectly adds 9 to 13 to get 22 orange marbles.\n\nOnce we have the correct number of orange marbles, which is 4, we can then calculate the number of purple marbles by multiplying the orange marbles by 4. This gives us 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 purple marbles.\n\nFinally, we add up all the marbles: 13 pink + 4 orange + 16 purple = 33 total marbles. Therefore, answer choice B is correct.",
