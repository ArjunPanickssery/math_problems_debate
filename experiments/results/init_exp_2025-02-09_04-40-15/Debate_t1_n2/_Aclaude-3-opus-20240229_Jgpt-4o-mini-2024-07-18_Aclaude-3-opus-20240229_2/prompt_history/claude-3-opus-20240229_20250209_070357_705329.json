Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nTo calculate the percentage off, we need to:\n1. Find the difference between the original price and the sale price. This can be done with simple subtraction.\n2. Divide the difference by the original price to get the percentage off as a decimal.\n3. Multiply by 100 to convert the decimal to a percentage.\n\nThe key mistake in the argument for answer A is that they divided the difference by the sale price instead of the original price. This gives an incorrect result.\n\nTo properly argue for answer B, I will:\n1. Clearly state the correct formula for calculating percentage off\n2. Show the step-by-step calculation using the given values\n3. Explain the conceptual error in the argument for answer A\n</thinking>\n\nTo calculate the percentage off, you take the difference between the original price and sale price, divide that by the original price, and multiply by 100:\n\nPercentage Off = (Original Price - Sale Price) / Original Price * 100\n\nPlugging in the values:\n($350 - $140) / $350 * 100\n= $210 / $350 * 100 \n= 0.60 * 100\n= 60%\n\nSo Asia got the dress for 60% off the original price.\n\nThe argument for answer A makes the mistake of dividing the $210 difference by the $140 sale price instead of the $350 original price. This calculates how much more expensive the original price was compared to the sale price, not the percentage discount. Percentages should always be calculated relative to the original amount.",
