Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key to this problem is figuring out how many books Albert has. The question states that Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu. To calculate this, I can use the math_eval tool.\n\nStu has 9 books, so the expression to calculate Albert's books is:\n9 * 4\n\nThis will give me the number of books Albert has. I can then add that to Stu's 9 books to get the total.\n\nSo the steps are:\n1. Use math_eval to calculate Albert's books \n2. Add the result to Stu's 9 books\n3. Return the total as the final answer\n</thinking>",
