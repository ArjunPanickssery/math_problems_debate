Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If each robe costs $2, how much will the school spend?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 36.0\nThe school needs to buy 30 - 12 = 18 robes.\nSo the school will spend 18 x $2 = $36.\n#### 36\n(B): 60.0\nTo find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for all singers who need robes.\nWith 30 singers and $2 per robe, the total cost would be 30 x $2 = $60.\n#### 60</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"

This would result in a cost of 18 x $2 = $36.\n\nTo determine which answer is correct, the key information needed is:\n- The total number of singers in the choir (30)\n- The number of robes the school currently has (12) \n- The cost per robe ($2)\n\nWith this information, we can calculate the number of additional robes needed and the total cost. No additional tools are needed to answer the question.\n</thinking>\n\nThe question clearly states that the school choir has 30 singers total, and that they currently only have 12 robes.
