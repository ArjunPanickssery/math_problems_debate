Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The relevant information is:\n- Total revenue over 3 days: $960\n- Ticket price: $4\nTo calculate the average tickets per day, we first need the total tickets sold, which can be found by dividing the total revenue by the ticket price. Then dividing that total by the number of days will give the average per day.\nThe key steps are:\n1. Calculate total tickets: total revenue / ticket price\n2. Calculate average per day: total tickets / number of days\nNo additional tools are needed, as the question provides all the necessary information directly. The math can be done manually.\n</thinking>\n\nThe total revenue of $960 over 3 days at $4 per ticket means a total of 960 / 4 = 240 tickets were sold. \nTo find the average per day, we divide the total tickets by the number of days:",
