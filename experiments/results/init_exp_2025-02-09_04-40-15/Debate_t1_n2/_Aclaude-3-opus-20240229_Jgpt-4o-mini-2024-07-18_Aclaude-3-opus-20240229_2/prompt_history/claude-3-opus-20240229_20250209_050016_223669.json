The number of 50-packs of index cards needed to have enough for all students \n4. The total cost of the index card packs\n\nMy assigned answer already correctly calculates steps 1 and 2:\n- Total students: 30 students/class * 6 classes = 180 students \n- Total index cards: 180 students * 10 cards/student = 1800 cards\n\nFor step 3, my answer divides the total cards by the pack size to get the number of packs:\n- Number of 50-packs: 1800 total cards / 50 cards/pack = 36 packs\n\nFinally, for step 4 it multiplies the number of packs by the $3 price per pack:\n- Total cost: 36 packs * $3/pack = $108\n\nThe key difference is that my answer correctly divides the total cards by 50 to determine the number of packs needed in step 3. The opposing answer incorrectly divides by 3 instead of 50 here, leading to the wrong number of packs and total cost.\n</thinking>\n\nMy answer of $108 is correct. Here's why:\n\nCarl has 30 students in each of his 6 classes, for a total of 180 students (30 * 6 = 180). \n\nSince he gives each student 10 index cards, the total number of index cards he needs is 1800 (180 students * 10 cards/student = 1800 cards total).\n\nIndex cards come in packs of 50 for $3 each. To determine how many packs Carl needs to buy, we divide the total cards by the number of cards per pack:\n\n1800 total cards / 50 cards per pack = 36 packs\n\nSo Carl needs to purchase 36 packs of index cards. At a price of $3 per pack, his total cost is:\n\n36 packs * $3/pack = $108\n\nThe opposing answer makes the mistake of dividing 1800 by 3 instead of 50 to (incorrectly) calculate 600 packs needed. But the problem states each pack contains 50 cards, not 3 cards, so this is an error.",
