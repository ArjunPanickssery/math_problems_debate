          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question asks how many white tiles there are in a design with 20 equal tiles, where:\n- 3 tiles are yellow\n- The number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles\n- 6 tiles are purple\n- The remaining tiles are white\n\nTo calculate the number of white tiles, we need to:\n1. Find the number of blue tiles (one more than yellow)\n2. Sum the number of yellow, blue, and purple tiles\n3. Subtract that sum from the total number of tiles (20) to get the number of white tiles\n\nThe key steps are adding up the number of colored tiles and subtracting that from the total. My answer does this correctly:\n- Yellow tiles: 3\n- Blue tiles: 3 + 1 = 4 \n- Purple tiles: 6\n- Total colored: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13\n- White tiles: 20 - 13 = 7\n\nThe opponent's answer makes an error in the second step. They find the number of blue tiles correctly as 4, but then only add the blue and purple, forgetting to include the 3 yellow tiles. This leads to an incorrect total of 10 colored tiles and therefore an incorrect number of white tiles.\n</thinking>\n\nMy answer correctly calculates the number of white tiles as 7. Here's why:\n\nThere are 3 yellow tiles, and the number of blue tiles is one more than yellow. So there are 3 + 1 = 4 blue tiles.\n\nIn total, there are:\n- 3 yellow tiles \n- 4 blue tiles\n- 6 purple tiles\nSumming those up: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 colored tiles in total.\n\nSince the design has 20 tiles total, and 13 are colored, the remaining tiles must be white. \n20 - 13 = 7 white tiles.\n\nThe opponent's answer makes the mistake of not including the 3 yellow tiles when totaling the colored tiles. They only add the blue and purple, getting 10 colored tiles. But they forgot the yellow ones! This leads them to the wrong number of white tiles.",
