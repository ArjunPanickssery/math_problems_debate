          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key difference between the two answers is whether we should calculate the cost for all 30 singers, or just the 18 singers who still need robes.\n\nAnswer A argues we only need to calculate the cost for the 18 singers who don't have robes yet. The school already has 12 robes, so they only need to buy 18 more at $2 each, for a total cost of $36.\n\nAnswer B argues we should calculate the cost for all 30 singers at $2 per robe, even though the school already has 12 robes. This would lead to a total cost of $60.\n\nTo determine which is correct, the key question is: Does the school need to buy robes for all 30 singers, or only the 18 who don't have robes yet?\n\nThe question states the school currently has 12 robes and needs to \"buy the rest\". This implies they only need to purchase robes for the singers who don't already have one.\n\nTherefore, I believe Answer A has the stronger argument. We should only calculate the cost for the 18 additional robes needed, not for all 30 singers.\n</thinking>\n\nThe question clearly states that the school already has 12 robes, and they only decided to \"buy the rest\". This means they will only be purchasing robes for the singers who don't already have one.\n\nSince there are 30 total singers and the school has 12 robes, that means they need to buy 30 - 12 = 18 more robes. At a cost of $2 per robe, the total amount the school will spend is therefore 18 x $2 = $36.\n\nThe argument for Answer B is flawed because it ignores the fact that the school already has 12 robes. There's no need for them to re-purchase robes they already own. They only need to buy robes for the remaining singers.\n\nSo in summary, the correct calculation is to find the number of additional robes needed (18) and multiply that by the cost per robe ($2). This gives the result of $36, as argued in Answer A.",
