Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Calculate the total amount John grew: 2 inches/month * 3 months\n2. Add that to his original height to get his new height in inches\n3. Convert the new height from inches to feet by dividing by 12 inches/foot\n\nAll the required information is available, so we can proceed with the math_eval tool calls in that order.\n</thinking>",
