Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

That's 3 days per week.\n- The book is 2100 pages long in total. \n- To calculate weeks, we first determine how many 100 page segments are needed. 2100 pages / 100 pages per segment = 21 segments.\n- Since Steve reads on 3 days per week, we can divide the 21 total segments needed by 3 to get the number of weeks.\n- 21 segments / 3 segments per week = 7 weeks.\n\nNo tools seem necessary here, as the problem can be solved with basic math that I can do in my head or by hand.\n</thinking>\n\nSteve reads 100 pages on 3 days each week - Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Since the book is 2100 pages long, that means he needs to read 2100 / 100 = 21 separate 100-page segments to finish the book. \n\nAs he reads 3 segments per week, we can calculate the total weeks needed by dividing the 21 total segments by the 3 segments he reads each week:\n\n21 segments / 3 segments per week = 7 weeks\n\nTherefore, it will take Steve 7 weeks to finish reading the 2100 page book at his current pace of 300 pages (3 100-page segments) per week. The correct answer is 7 weeks.",
