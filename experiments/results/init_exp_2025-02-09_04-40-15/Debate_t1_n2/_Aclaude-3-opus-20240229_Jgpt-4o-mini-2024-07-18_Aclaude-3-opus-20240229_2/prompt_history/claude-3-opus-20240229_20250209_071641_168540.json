Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question is asking how many total baby plants the mother spider plant will produce after 4 years, given that it produces 2 baby plants 2 times per year.\n\nTo calculate the total, we can use the math_eval tool to multiply the number of baby plants per cycle (2) by the number of cycles per year (2) to get the number of baby plants produced per year (4). Then we can multiply that by the number of years (4) to get the total number of baby plants produced over the 4 year period.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1. Calculate baby plants per year: 2 plants/cycle * 2 cycles/year = 4 plants/year\n2. Calculate total baby plants: 4 plants/year * 4 years = 16 total plants\n\nSince we have the numbers needed to perform these calculations, we can proceed with using the math_eval tool to get the final result.\n</thinking>",
