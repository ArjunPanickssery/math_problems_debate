Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

To determine the initial amount of money Isabel had, we need to work backwards from the $51 she has left.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1. Isabel spent half the remaining money to buy her brother a book, leaving her with $51. To get the amount before buying the book, we need to double $51.\n2. Before buying the book, Isabel spent half the money to buy a toy. So to get the amount before buying the toy, we need to double the result from step 1.\n3. The result from step 2 will be the initial amount Isabel started with.\n\nThe required parameter for math_eval is the expression to evaluate. We can construct this expression based on the steps above.\n</thinking>",
