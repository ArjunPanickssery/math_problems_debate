Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Calculate his old weekly pay (hourly rate * hours per week)\n2. Calculate his new weekly pay \n3. Find the difference in weekly pay\n4. Multiply the weekly pay difference by 52 weeks per year\n\nI have all the information needed to perform these calculations, so no additional tools are required.\n</thinking>\n\nJames' old weekly pay was $16 per hour * 25 hours per week = $400 per week.\nHis new weekly pay is $20 per hour * 40 hours per week = $800 per week.\nThe difference in weekly pay is $800 - $400 = $400 more per week.\nOver 52 weeks, the additional annual pay is $400 per week * 52 weeks = $20,800 per year.\n\nTherefore, James makes $20,800 more per year in his new job compared to his old job.
