Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The correct answer is 408 dollars. Let's work backwards from the $51 that Isabel has left at the end. Before buying her brother the book, she had double that amount, which is $102. And before buying the toy, she had double the $102, which comes to $204. Therefore, the amount she started with must have been double $204, or $408 total. The key is to realize that each time Isabel spends half her money, the remaining amount is half of what she had before spending. So to find the initial amount, we need to double the remaining money twice.",
