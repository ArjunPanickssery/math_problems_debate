Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Calculate the fraction of money remaining by subtracting the spent fraction (2/3) from the total (3/3 or 1). This gives us 1/3.\n2. Multiply the total amount ($150) by the remaining fraction (1/3) to get the dollar amount left.\n\nThe required parameter for math_eval (expr) can be inferred by constructing the appropriate mathematical expression based on the problem description. All the necessary information is available, so we can proceed with the tool call.\n</thinking>",
