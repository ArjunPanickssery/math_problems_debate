Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key difference between the two approaches is in how they interpret the phrase \"10 more than 4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked\". \nAnswer A interprets this as 10 + 4x, where x is the number Kylie picked. \nAnswer B interprets it as 4(x + 10).\n\nTo determine which is correct, I need to carefully parse the original phrasing. \"10 more than 4 times the amount\" suggests we should take 4 times Kylie's amount first, then add 10. This matches the interpretation in Answer B.\n\nIf the phrasing was \"4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked, plus 10 more\", then the interpretation in Answer A would be correct. But that is not how the original question was worded.\n\nSo based on a precise reading of the question text, Answer B has the correct interpretation and equation setup. The math in Answer B also checks out - if Kylie picked 60 apples and Kayla picked 4(60+10) = 280, that sums to the stated total of 340.\n</thinking>\n\nThe correct answer is B. The key is in how you interpret the phrase \"10 more than 4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked\". \n\nAnswer B correctly interprets this as 4(x+10), where x is the number of apples Kylie picked. You take 4 times Kylie's amount first, then add 10. \n\nThe phrasing in the question makes it clear this is the right interpretation. It says \"10 more than 4 times the amount...\", not \"4 times the amount plus 10 more\".\n\nPlugging in the numbers, if Kylie picked 60 apples, then Kayla picked 4(60+10) = 280 apples. 60 + 280 = 340, matching the total amount stated in the question. Therefore, B is the correct answer.",
