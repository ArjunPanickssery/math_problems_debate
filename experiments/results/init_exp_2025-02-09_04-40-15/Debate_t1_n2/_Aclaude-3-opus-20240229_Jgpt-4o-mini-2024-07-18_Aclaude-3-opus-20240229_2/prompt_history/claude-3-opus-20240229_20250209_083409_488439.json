Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

To do this, I can use the math_eval tool to calculate 40% of $15 and show that it equals $6.00.\n\nThe math_eval tool takes an expression parameter. To calculate 40% of $15, the expression should be:\n\n15 * 0.4\n\nThis multiplies the original price by the discount percentage expressed as a decimal.\n\nI have the necessary information to make this tool call, so I will proceed with it in my argument.\n</thinking>",
