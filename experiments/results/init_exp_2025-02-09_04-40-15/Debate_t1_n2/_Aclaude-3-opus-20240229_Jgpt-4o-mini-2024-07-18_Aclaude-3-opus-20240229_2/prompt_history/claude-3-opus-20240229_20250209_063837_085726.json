Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Find the number of orange marbles by subtracting 9 from the number of pink marbles (13)\n2. Find the number of purple marbles by multiplying the number of orange marbles by 4\n3. Add up the number of pink, orange, and purple marbles\nNo tools are needed, as this can be solved with basic arithmetic. The information provided is sufficient to calculate the total number of marbles.\n</thinking>\n\nKatie has 13 pink marbles. To find the number of orange marbles, we subtract 9 from 13, which equals 4 orange marbles. \n\nNext, we multiply the 4 orange marbles by 4 to get the number of purple marbles, which is 16.\n\nFinally, we add up all the marbles:\n13 pink + 4 orange + 16 purple = 33 total marbles\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) 33 marbles. The reasoning in answer A is incorrect because it adds 9 to the pink marbles instead of subtracting, which throws off the subsequent calculations.",
