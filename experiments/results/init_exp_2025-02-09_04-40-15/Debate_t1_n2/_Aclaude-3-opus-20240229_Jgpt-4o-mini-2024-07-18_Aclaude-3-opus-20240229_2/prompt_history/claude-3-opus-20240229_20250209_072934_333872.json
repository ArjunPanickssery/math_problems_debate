Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nTo argue that answer (A) 4.0 is correct, I will focus on the wording \"Mike and Rita shared the bars\". This could be interpreted to mean that Mike and Rita shared their portion of the bars with each other, rather than each getting an equal individual share.\n</thinking>\n\nThe question states that Mike and Rita shared the chocolate bars, which implies they split a single portion between the two of them. If the box of 12 bars was divided equally among the 3 people, then each person's share would be 12/3 = 4 bars. Since the question specifies Mike and Rita shared, the most reasonable interpretation is that they shared a 4 bar portion, while Anita got her own 4 bar portion separately. Therefore, the correct answer is that Mike and Rita got a combined total of 4 bars.",
