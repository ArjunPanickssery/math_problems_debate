Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

This gives us 297 hens in total.\n\nWe are told that 20 of the hens do not lay eggs. To get the number of egg-laying hens, we simply subtract these 20 non-laying hens from the total of 297 hens. \n\n297 total hens - 20 non-laying hens = 277 egg-laying hens\n\nTherefore, Mr. Curtis has 277 egg-laying hens on his farm.
