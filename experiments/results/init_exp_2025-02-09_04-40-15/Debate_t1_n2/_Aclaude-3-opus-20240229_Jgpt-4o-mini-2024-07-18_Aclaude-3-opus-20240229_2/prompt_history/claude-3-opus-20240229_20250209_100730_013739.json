Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Using the math_eval tool, we can see that twice 1 bag is 2 bags (1 * 2 = 2). So he ate 2 bags after dinner.\n\nTo get the total, we simply need to add the 1 bag from dinner to the 2 bags after dinner. Using math_eval again, 1 + 2 = 3. \n\nTherefore, the total number of bags of chips John ate is 3, which matches answer choice B.
