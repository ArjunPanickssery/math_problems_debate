Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

No additional tools or information are needed.\n</thinking>\n\nBrianne's savings will progress as follows:\nJanuary: $10\nFebruary: $10 * 2 = $20 \nMarch: $20 * 2 = $40\nApril: $40 * 2 = $80\nMay: $80 * 2 = $160\n\nTherefore, Brianne will save $160 in May, which matches answer choice B. The calculation in answer A is incorrect - it triples the amount each month instead of doubling it. \n\nBy consistently doubling the previous month's savings starting from $10 in January, the correct amount saved in May is $160.",
