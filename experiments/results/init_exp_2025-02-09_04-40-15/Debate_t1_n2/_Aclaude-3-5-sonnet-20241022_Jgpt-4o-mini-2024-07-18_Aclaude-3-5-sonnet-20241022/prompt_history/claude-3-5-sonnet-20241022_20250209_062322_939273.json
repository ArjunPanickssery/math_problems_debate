Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The question clearly states that \"two of them are 1.5 hours each,\" meaning each CD is 1.5 hours, not their combined length. When it says \"the last one is twice that long,\" it means twice 1.5 hours, which equals 3 hours. Therefore, we have one CD of 3 hours and one CD of 1.5 hours, totaling 4.5 hours. Answer A incorrectly doubles the 1.5 hours twice - once for the \"two CDs\" and again for the longer CD, leading to an inflated total. The correct calculation is 1.5 + 3 = 4.5 hours.",
