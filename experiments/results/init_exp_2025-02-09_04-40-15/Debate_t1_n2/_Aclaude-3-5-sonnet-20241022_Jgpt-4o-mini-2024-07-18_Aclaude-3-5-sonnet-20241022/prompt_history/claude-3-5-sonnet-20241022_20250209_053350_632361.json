Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The conversion rate of gallons to pints is 8:1, meaning 20 gallons equals 160 pints. This is a fundamental conversion that can be verified through any reliable measurement system. When we divide 160 pints among 80 containers, each container holds exactly 2 pints. Since Geraldo consumed 3.5 containers, he drank 3.5 \u00d7 2 = 7 pints of tea. The opposing answer incorrectly assumes that 20 gallons equals 120 pints, which would mean 1 gallon equals 6 pints. This is mathematically incorrect, as the standard conversion is 1 gallon = 8 pints.",
