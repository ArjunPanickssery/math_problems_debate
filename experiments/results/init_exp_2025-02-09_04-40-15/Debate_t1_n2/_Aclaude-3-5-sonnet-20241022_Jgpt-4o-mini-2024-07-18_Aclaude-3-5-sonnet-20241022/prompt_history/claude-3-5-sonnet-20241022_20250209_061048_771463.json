Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The calculation showing $50 as the remaining amount is mathematically sound and logical. When the housewife spends 2/3 of her money, she has 1/3 left. To find the remaining amount, we multiply the original amount ($150) by the fraction remaining (1/3), which equals $50. This follows the basic principle of finding a fraction of a whole number. The opposing answer incorrectly multiplies by 2/3 (the amount spent) rather than 1/3 (the amount remaining), which leads to the wrong conclusion of $100 remaining. The question asks for what's left, not what was spent.",
