Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The question clearly states that Katie has \"half as many books as Darla.\" Since Darla has 6 books, Katie must have 3 books (6 \u00f7 2 = 3), not 12 books as suggested in answer B. This is a fundamental misinterpretation that invalidates the entire calculation in B. Gary's books are calculated by taking 5 times the combined books of Darla and Katie (5 \u00d7 (6 + 3) = 45). Therefore, the total number of books is 6 + 3 + 45 = 54 books. Answer A follows the precise wording of the question and provides the correct mathematical solution.",
