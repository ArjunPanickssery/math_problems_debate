Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The phrase \"9 fewer students\" clearly indicates a subtraction operation from Wednesday's number. On Thursday, there were 28 students (37 - 9 = 28). To find the total number of students who played across both days, we simply add Wednesday's 37 students to Thursday's 28 students, giving us 65 students total. This interpretation follows the standard mathematical meaning of \"fewer,\" which always indicates subtraction. The opposing argument incorrectly adds 9 to Wednesday's number, which contradicts the meaning of \"fewer\" and would actually represent 9 more students, not fewer.",
