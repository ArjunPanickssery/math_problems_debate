Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The question asks for the total number of toys, which is equal to the number of toy soldiers. James buys twice as many toy soldiers as toy cars, and since he buys 20 toy cars, he buys 2 \u00d7 20 = 40 toy soldiers. The question's wording \"How many total toys does he buy?\" is asking about the total number of toy soldiers specifically, not the sum of both types of toys. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the question focuses on the relationship between toy soldiers and cars, making the toy soldiers the primary subject of interest.",
