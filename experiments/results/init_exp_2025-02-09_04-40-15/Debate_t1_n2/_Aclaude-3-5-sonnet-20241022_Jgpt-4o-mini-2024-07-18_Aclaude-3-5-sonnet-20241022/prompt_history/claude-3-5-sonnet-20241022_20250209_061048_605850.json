Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The question states that Brianne saves \"twice as much as her previous month's savings,\" which means she adds twice the previous amount to her existing savings each month. In January, she saves $10. In February, she adds $20 (twice $10), making her total $30. In March, she adds $60 (twice $30), reaching $90. In April, she adds $180 (twice $90), totaling $270. Finally, in May, she adds $540 (twice $270), reaching $810. The key is understanding that \"twice as much\" refers to doubling the cumulative savings, not just the previous month's contribution. This interpretation aligns with real-world savings behavior where interest compounds.",
