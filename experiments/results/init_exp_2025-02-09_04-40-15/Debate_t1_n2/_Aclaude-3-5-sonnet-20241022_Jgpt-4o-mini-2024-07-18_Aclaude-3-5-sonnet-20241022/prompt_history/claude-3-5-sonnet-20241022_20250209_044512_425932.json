Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If she paid $480, how much was the original price of the pair of shoes?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 600.0\nLyra only paid $480 for the pair of shoes which is only 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.\nSo let x be the original price.\nThen 0.8x = $480\nThus x = $480 / 0.8 = $600\n#### 600\n(A): 576\nThe discount amount is 20% of $480 = $96\nThe original price is $480 + $96 = $576\n#### 576</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"

          "content": "The correct approach is to recognize that the discounted price ($480) represents 80% of the original price, not 100%. When calculating discounts, we must work backwards from the final price. If $480 is 80% (or 0.8) of the original price, then dividing $480 by 0.8 gives us the original price of $600. The opposing solution incorrectly assumes that $480 is the base price and adds 20% of that amount, which is mathematically flawed because the discount was taken from the original price, not the final price. This is a common mistake in discount calculations.",
