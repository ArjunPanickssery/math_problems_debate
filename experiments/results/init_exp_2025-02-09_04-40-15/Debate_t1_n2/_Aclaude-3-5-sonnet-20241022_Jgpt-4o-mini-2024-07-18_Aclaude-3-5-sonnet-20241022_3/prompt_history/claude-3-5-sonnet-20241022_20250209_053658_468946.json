Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The correct approach is to calculate the total rainfall for each day type and find their difference. On Mondays, it rained 1.5 cm \u00d7 7 days = 10.5 cm total. On Tuesdays, it rained 2.5 cm \u00d7 9 days = 22.5 cm total. To find how much more it rained on Tuesdays than Mondays, we subtract: 22.5 - 10.5 = 12 cm. The opponent's method is flawed because it only considers the per-day difference (2.5 - 1.5 = 1) and multiplies by Tuesday's count (9), completely ignoring that there were fewer Mondays. This leads to an underestimation of the total difference.",
