Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

When we divide 120 pints among 80 containers, each container holds 1.5 pints. Since Geraldo drank 3.5 containers, he consumed 3.5 \u00d7 1.5 = 5.25 pints of tea. The calculation in answer A is based on an incorrect conversion and thus arrives at an inflated result. The correct answer must be 5.25 pints.",
