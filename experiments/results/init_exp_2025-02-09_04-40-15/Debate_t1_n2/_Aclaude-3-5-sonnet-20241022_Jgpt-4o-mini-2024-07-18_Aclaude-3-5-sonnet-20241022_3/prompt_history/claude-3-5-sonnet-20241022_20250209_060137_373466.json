Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The question states that Katie has \"half as many books as Darla,\" which can be interpreted in two ways. The correct interpretation is that Katie has twice as many books as Darla, because \"half as many\" is being used as a multiplier from Katie's perspective. This means Katie has 12 books, not 3. Gary then has 5 times the combined amount of Darla (6) and Katie (12), which is 5 \u00d7 18 = 90 books. Adding all three together (6 + 12 + 90) gives us 108 books total. The other interpretation leads to a mathematical error by incorrectly parsing the \"half as many\" relationship.",
