Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The calculation must account for both the per-pound pricing and the total weight calculation. When Farmer Kent prices his watermelons at $2 per pound, this is the base unit price. For each watermelon, we first calculate $2 \u00d7 23 pounds = $46, but this only accounts for the single-unit pricing. Since these are special watermelons sold by weight, we must multiply by 2 again to account for the per-pound pricing structure. This gives us $46 \u00d7 18 \u00d7 2 = $1,656. The double multiplication by 2 is necessary because we're dealing with both a per-unit and per-pound pricing system.",
