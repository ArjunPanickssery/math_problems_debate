Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The question states that there are \"six times as many ticks as burrs,\" which is a clear multiplicative relationship. With 12 burrs, we multiply by 6 to get 72 ticks (12 \u00d7 6 = 72). This follows the standard mathematical interpretation of \"times as many\" statements. The total foreign objects would be the sum of all burrs and ticks: 72 ticks + 12 burrs = 84 objects. Answer B incorrectly interprets \"six times as many\" as addition rather than multiplication, which is mathematically incorrect. The phrase \"times as many\" always indicates multiplication, not addition.",
