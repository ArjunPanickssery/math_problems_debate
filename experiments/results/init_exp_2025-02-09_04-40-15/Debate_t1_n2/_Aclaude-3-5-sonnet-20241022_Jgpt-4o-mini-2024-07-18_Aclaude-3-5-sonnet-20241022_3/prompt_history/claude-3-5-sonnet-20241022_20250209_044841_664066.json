Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the ratio between boys and girls. If there are three times as many girls as boys, this means that for every 1 boy, there are 3 girls. This creates a total of 4 parts (1 part boys + 3 parts girls = 4 parts total). Since we know the Biology class has 100 students total (half of 200), we need to divide 100 by 4 to find how many students make up one part. 100/4 = 25, and since boys represent one part, there must be 25 boys in the Biology class. This is the mathematically correct way to solve ratio problems.",
