Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The question states Mary gives away \"half\" and \"a third\" of her shirts, but it's ambiguous whether these fractions apply to the specific color groups or to the total number of shirts. Since Mary has a total of 62 shirts, it makes more sense to interpret \"half\" as applying to the brown shirts (36 is closer to half of 62) and \"a third\" to the blue shirts (26 is closer to a third of 62). This interpretation yields 18 brown shirts given away (36/2) and approximately 9 blue shirts given away (26/3), leaving her with 35 shirts total. This reading is more natural as it aligns the fractions with the proportions of her total shirt collection.",
