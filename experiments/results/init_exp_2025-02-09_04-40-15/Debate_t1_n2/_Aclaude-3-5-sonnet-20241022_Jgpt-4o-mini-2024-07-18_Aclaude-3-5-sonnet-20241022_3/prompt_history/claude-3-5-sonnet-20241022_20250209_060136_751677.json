Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The calculation in answer A is mathematically correct and follows the logical sequence of the problem. When something costs 1/10 as much, we divide the original price by 10 ($2500/10 = $250) and then add this to the original price ($2500 + $250 = $2750). Answer B incorrectly subtracts the barbell cost instead of adding it, which makes no sense in the context of purchasing two items. The question asks for the total amount paid, which must be the sum of both items' costs. This is a straightforward addition problem after determining the barbell's price.",
