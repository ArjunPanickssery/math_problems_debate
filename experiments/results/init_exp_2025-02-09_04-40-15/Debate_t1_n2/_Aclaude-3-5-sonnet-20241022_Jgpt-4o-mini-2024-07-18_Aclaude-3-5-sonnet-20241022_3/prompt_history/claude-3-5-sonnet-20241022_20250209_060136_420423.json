Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The calculation must account for the 25% loss when lashing ropes together, which is a crucial factor the opposing argument completely ignores. When connecting rope pieces, 5 feet (25% of 20) is lost at each connection point due to the overlapping and knots required for secure lashing. With a total height of 60 feet needed, each 20-foot piece effectively contributes only 15 feet to the total length after accounting for lashing loss. Therefore, we need 60/15 = 4 pieces to achieve the required length. Using only 3 pieces would leave us significantly short of the target length when accounting for these essential connection losses.",
