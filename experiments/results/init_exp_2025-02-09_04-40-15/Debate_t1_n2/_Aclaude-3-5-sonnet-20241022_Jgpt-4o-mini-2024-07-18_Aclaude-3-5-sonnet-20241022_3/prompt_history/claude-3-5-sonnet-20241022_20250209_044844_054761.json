Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The calculation in option B is the correct approach because it treats each category independently from the total number of crayons. When given percentages and fractions in a problem, they should all be calculated from the original total. One-third of 120 is 40 new crayons, and 20% of 120 is 24 broken crayons. The remaining crayons (120 - 40 - 24 = 56) are slightly used. Option A incorrectly assumes that the 20% broken applies only to the remaining crayons after removing the new ones, which wasn't specified in the question. The percentages should be applied to the total quantity.",
