Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many men are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 420.0\nThe percentage for women is 100% - 70% = 30%.\nSince 180 represents 30%, then 180/30 = 6 students represent 1%.\nHence, 6 x 70 = 420 students are men.\n#### 420\n(B): 126\nSince 70% of students are men, we can find the number by taking 70% of 180:\n180 \u00d7 0.7 = 126 men in the department.\n#### 126</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"
