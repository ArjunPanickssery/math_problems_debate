Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The correct approach is to consider the difference in rainfall per day between Tuesdays and Mondays, which is 1 centimeter (2.5 - 1.5). Since we want to know how much more it rained on Tuesdays than Mondays, we multiply this difference by the number of Tuesdays (9), giving us 9 centimeters. The other approach incorrectly compares total rainfall, which doesn't account for the different number of days. It's like comparing apples to oranges because we're looking at different numbers of days. The question asks for the excess rainfall on Tuesdays, so we should only consider the additional rain that fell on each Tuesday.",
