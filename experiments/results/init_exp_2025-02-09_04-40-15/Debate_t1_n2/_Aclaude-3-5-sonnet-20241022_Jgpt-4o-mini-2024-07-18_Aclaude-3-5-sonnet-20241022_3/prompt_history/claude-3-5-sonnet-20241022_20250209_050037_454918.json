Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

This makes sense because pet stores often price items in bulk - 4 dollars worth of biscuits and 2 dollars worth of bones daily. Let's calculate:\n\nFor bones: $4 per day \u00d7 7 days = $28\nFor biscuits: $2 per day \u00d7 $0.25 (discount rate) \u00d7 7 days = $3.50\n\nLet me verify the total:",
