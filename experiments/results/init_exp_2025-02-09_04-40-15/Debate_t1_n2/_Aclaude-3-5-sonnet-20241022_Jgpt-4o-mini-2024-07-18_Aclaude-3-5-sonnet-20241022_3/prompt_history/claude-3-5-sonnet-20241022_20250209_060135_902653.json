Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The question specifically mentions that Mike and Rita \"shared\" the bars, which implies they split their portion between themselves, separate from Anita's share. When we divide 12 bars among three people (Mike and Rita counting as one unit since they're sharing, plus Anita), each unit gets 4 bars. Therefore, Mike and Rita together received 4 bars, which they then shared between themselves. The word \"shared\" is crucial here - if the question meant to ask about their individual portions added together, it would have used different phrasing like \"how many bars did Mike and Rita get in total\" rather than implying they shared a single portion.",
