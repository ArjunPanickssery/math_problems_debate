How many foreign objects total are caught in the dog's fur?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 84.0\nFirst find how many burrs are caught in the dog's fur: 12 burrs * 6 ticks/burr = 72 ticks\nThen add the number of burrs to find the total number objects: 72 objects + 12 objects = 84 objects\n#### 84\n(B): 30.0\nFirst find how many ticks are caught in the dog's fur: 12 burrs + 6 = 18 ticks\nThen add the number of burrs to find the total number of objects: 18 ticks + 12 burrs = 30 objects\n#### 30\n\nPlease note that anything that is included in\n<tool_result></tool_result>\ntags is guaranteed to be true.\n\nContext: \n\nBased on the information and arguments above, give a probability between 0 and 1 that you think answer A is correct.\n\nYou must give your answer in the form\n\n{'prob': (some float between 0 and 1)}"
