How much was she able to take home?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 35.0\nWinwin paid $50 x 20/100 = $10 for the tax.\nSo, she has $50 - $10 = 40 after paying the tax.\nTherefore, Winwin was able to take home $40 - $5 = $35 after she paid for the processing fee.\n#### 35\n(B): 36.0\nFirst subtract the processing fee: $50 - $5 = $45\nThen calculate 20% tax of $45: $45 x 20/100 = $9\nTherefore, Winwin was able to take home $45 - $9 = $36\n#### 36\n\nPlease note that anything that is included in\n<tool_result></tool_result>\ntags is guaranteed to be true.\n\nContext: \n\nBased on the information and arguments above, give a probability between 0 and 1 that you think answer A is correct.\n\nYou must give your answer in the form\n\n{'prob': (some float between 0 and 1)}"
