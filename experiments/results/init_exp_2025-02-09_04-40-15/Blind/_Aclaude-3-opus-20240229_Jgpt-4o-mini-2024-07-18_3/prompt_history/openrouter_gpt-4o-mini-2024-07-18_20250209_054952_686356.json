      "content": "Question: QUESTION: June made a design with 20 equal tiles. Three tiles are yellow and the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles. Six tiles are purple and the remaining tiles are white.  How many white tiles are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 7.0\nThere are 3 + 1 = 4 blue tiles.\nThere are a total of 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 tiles are yellow, blue, and purple.\nHence, 20 - 13 = 7 tiles are white.\n#### 7\n(B): 10.0\nThe yellow and blue tiles together total 3 + 1 = 4 tiles.\nAdding the purple tiles gives us 4 + 6 = 10 colored tiles.\nTherefore, 20 - 10 = 10 tiles must be white.\n#### 10\n\nPlease note that anything that is included in\n<tool_result></tool_result>\ntags is guaranteed to be true.\n\nContext: \n\nBased on the information and arguments above, give a probability between 0 and 1 that you think answer A is correct.\n\nYou must give your answer in the form\n\n{'prob': (some float between 0 and 1)}"
