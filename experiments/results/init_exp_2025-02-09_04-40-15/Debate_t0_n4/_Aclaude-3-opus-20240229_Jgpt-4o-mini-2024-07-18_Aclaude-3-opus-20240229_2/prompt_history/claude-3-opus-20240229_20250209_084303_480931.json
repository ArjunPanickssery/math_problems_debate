Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key information given in the question is:\n- Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina\n- Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina\n- Mabel has 85 marbles\n\nTo determine how many marbles Katrina has, I can divide Mabel's total marbles by 5, since Mabel has 5 times as many as Katrina.\n\n85 / 5 = 17\n\nSo Katrina has 17 marbles.\n\nTo get Amanda's total marbles, I first need to calculate twice Katrina's amount, which is 17 * 2 = 34. Then I subtract 12 from that, since Amanda needs 12 more marbles to reach twice Katrina's amount.\n\n34 - 12 = 22 \n\nTherefore, Amanda has 22 marbles.\n\nFinally, to determine how many more marbles Mabel has compared to Amanda, I subtract Amanda's total from Mabel's:\n\n85 - 22 = 63\n\nThis matches the reasoning and result in answer choice (A). I have all the information I need to argue that (A) is the correct answer.\n</thinking>\n\nAnswer (A) is correct. Here's why:\n\nWe are told that Mabel has 85 marbles, which is 5 times as many as Katrina. Using division, we can determine that Katrina must have 85 / 5 = 17 marbles. \n\nThe question also states that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many as Katrina. Twice Katrina's amount is 17 * 2 = 34 marbles. Since Amanda needs 12 more than she currently has to reach 34, we can subtract to find that Amanda's current marble count is 34 - 12 = 22 marbles.\n\nTherefore, Mabel with her 85 marbles has 85 - 22 = 63 more marbles than Amanda. The correct answer is 63 marbles, which matches choice (A).",
