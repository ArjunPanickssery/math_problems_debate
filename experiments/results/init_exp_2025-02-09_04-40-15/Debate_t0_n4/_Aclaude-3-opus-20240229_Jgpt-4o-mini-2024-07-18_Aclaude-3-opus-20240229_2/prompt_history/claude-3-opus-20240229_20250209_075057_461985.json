Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe relevant information to calculate the total number of baby plants produced by the mother plant over 4 years is:\n- The mother plant produces 2 baby plants 2 times a year\n- We need to calculate the total over a 4 year period\n\nTo calculate the total, we can't just multiply 2 babies * 2 times per year * 4 years, as the opponent argues. That would assume the same number of babies are produced each year.\n\nInstead, we need to calculate the number of babies produced each year and sum them up. The number of babies doubles each year:\nYear 1: 2 + 2 = 4 \nYear 2: 4 + 4 = 8\nYear 3: 8 + 8 = 16 \nYear 4: 16 + 16 = 32\n\nTo get the total, we sum the babies per year: 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 60\n\nSo the key points are:\n- Number of babies doubles each year \n- Need to sum babies per year, not just multiply\n</thinking>\n\nThe mother plant produces 2 baby plants twice a year, which means it produces 4 baby plants in the first year. \n\nIn the second year, the number of babies produced each time doubles to 4. So in year 2 it's 4 babies twice, for a total of 8 babies that year.\n\nIn year 3, the number of babies doubles again to 8 each time, so 16 babies are produced in year 3. \n\nBy year 4, it's producing 16 babies twice, for a total of 32 babies in the fourth year alone.\n\nTo get the total, we sum up the number of babies per year:\n- Year 1: 4 babies\n- Year 2: 8 babies \n- Year 3: 16 babies\n- Year 4: 32 babies\n\n4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 60 total babies produced over the 4 years.\n\nThe key is that the number of babies doubles each year. You can't just multiply 2 * 2 * 4 to get the total. You have to sum the total babies per year, which forms a doubling sequence.",
