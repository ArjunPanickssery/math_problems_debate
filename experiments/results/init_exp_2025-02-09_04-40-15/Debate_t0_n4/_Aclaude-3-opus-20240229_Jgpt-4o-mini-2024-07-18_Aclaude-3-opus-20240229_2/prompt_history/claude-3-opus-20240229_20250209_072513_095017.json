Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nTo determine which argument is correct, we need to carefully consider the information provided in the question.\n\nThe question states that John buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students, and that he has 6 classes with 30 students in each class. \n\nThe key point is that John is buying packs for each individual student, not just for each class. So to calculate the total number of packs, we first need to determine the total number of students by multiplying the number of classes by the number of students per class.\n\nOnce we have the total student count, we can then multiply that by the 2 packs per student to get the final total packs purchased.\n\nMy assigned answer follows this logic - it first calculates the total students as 6 classes * 30 students per class = 180 students total. Then it multiplies the 180 students by 2 packs per student to arrive at 360 total packs.\n\nIn contrast, the opposing argument incorrectly assumes John is buying 2 packs per class rather than per student. It skips the step of calculating total students and just multiplies the 6 classes by 2 packs. \n\nBut the question clearly states the packs are purchased for \"all his students\", not all his classes. So the opposing argument's interpretation is not supported by the details provided.\n</thinking>\n\nBased on the information given in the question, my answer of 360 packs is correct. The question states that John buys 2 packs of index cards for each of his students, not just 2 packs per class. \n\nTo properly calculate the total packs, we first need to determine the total number of students John has by multiplying his 6 classes by the 30 students per class:",
