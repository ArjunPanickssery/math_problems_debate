Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Find the discounted price per book\n2. Multiply the discounted price by the number of books purchased\n\nThe discounted price per book can be calculated by subtracting the $0.5 discount from the regular $5 price. \n\n$5 - $0.5 = $4.5 per book\n\nThen multiplying the discounted price by 10 books will give the total amount paid.\n\n$4.5 * 10 = $45\n\nThe math_eval tool could be used to perform these calculations and confirm the result is $45.\n</thinking>",
