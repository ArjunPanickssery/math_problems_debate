Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Determine how many bars each person got by dividing the total bars by the number of people\n2. Add together Mike and Rita's individual bar counts to get their combined total\n\nNo tools are needed, as I can perform these calculations directly based on the provided information.\n</thinking>\n\nThe question states that the 12 chocolate bars were shared equally between Mike, Rita, and Anita. With 3 people sharing equally, each person would receive 12 \u00f7 3 = 4 bars. \n\nSince Mike got 4 bars and Rita also got 4 bars, together they received a total of 4 + 4 = 8 bars.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Mike and Rita got a combined total of 8 bars, which matches answer choice B.",
