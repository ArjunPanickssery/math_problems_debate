Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

We are also told there are 6 more green bowling balls than red. \n\nTo calculate the number of green bowling balls, we need to take the number of red bowling balls (30) and add 6 to that.\n\n30 + 6 = 36\n\nSo there are 36 green bowling balls.\n\nTo get the total, we add the number of red bowling balls (30) and the number of green bowling balls (36):\n\n30 + 36 = 66\n\nThis matches the calculation and result in Answer B, so I believe Answer B is correct.\n</thinking>",
