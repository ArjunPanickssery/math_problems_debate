Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key information in the question is:\n- Carol sold tickets worth $960 total over 3 days\n- Each ticket costs $4\n- We need to calculate the average number of tickets sold per day\n\nTo calculate this, we first need to determine the total number of tickets sold, which can be done by dividing the total revenue by the cost per ticket:\n\nTotal tickets = $960 / $4 = 240 tickets\n\nThen to get the average per day, we divide the total tickets by the number of days:\n\nAverage tickets per day = 240 tickets / 3 days = 80 tickets per day\n\nSo the correct answer is (B) 80 tickets per day on average. The reasoning in (A) is flawed - it multiplies the daily revenue by the ticket cost, which doesn't make sense. The daily revenue already factors in the ticket cost.\n</thinking>\n\nThe correct answer is (B) 80 tickets per day on average. Here's why:\n\nWe know Carol sold a total of $960 worth of tickets over the 3 days. Since each ticket costs $4, we can calculate the total number of tickets sold by dividing the total revenue by the per ticket cost:",
