Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe math_eval tool is not needed here, as the question can be answered with basic arithmetic that I can do myself.\n\nThe key information given is:\n- There are 3 times as many girls as boys in the Biology class\n- The Physics class has 200 students\n- The Biology class has half as many students as the Physics class\n\nFrom this, we can determine:\n- The Biology class has 200/2 = 100 students total\n- If we let x be the number of boys, then the number of girls is 3x\n- The total number of students is x + 3x = 4x\n- We know the total is 100, so 4x = 100\n- Solving, x = 100/4 = 25\n\nTherefore, the number of boys in the Biology class is 25, so answer A is correct.\n</thinking>\n\nAnswer A is correct. Here's why:\n\nWe're told the Physics class has 200 students, and the Biology class has half as many students as Physics. Half of 200 is 100, so there are 100 total students in the Biology class.\n\nIt's also stated that there are 3 times as many girls as boys in Biology. Let x be the number of boys. Then the number of girls is 3x. The total class size is x + 3x = 4x. \n\nWe know the total class size is 100, so we can set up the equation:\n4x = 100\n\nSolving for x:\nx = 100/4 = 25\n\nTherefore, there are 25 boys in the Biology class, so answer A is correct.",
