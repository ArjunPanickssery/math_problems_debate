Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The break time should not be included since he is not driving during the break.\n\nTotal driving time: \n4 hours + 9 hours = 13 hours\n\nWith the speed and total driving time, I can calculate the total distance:\n60 miles/hour * 13 hours \n\nThis can be evaluated with the math_eval tool.\n</thinking>",
