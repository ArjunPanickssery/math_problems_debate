Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Calculate the total number of classes needed by dividing total credits by credits per class\n2. Divide the total number of classes by the number of semesters to get classes per semester\nNo tools are needed, as this can be calculated directly from the given information.\n</thinking>\n\n120 total credits divided by 3 credits per class equals 40 total classes needed.\n\n40 total classes divided across 8 semesters is 40 / 8 = 5 classes per semester.\n\nTherefore, Maddy needs to take an average of 5 classes each semester to graduate with 120 credits over 8 semesters. The math clearly shows that 5 classes per semester is the correct answer.",
