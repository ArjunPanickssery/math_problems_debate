Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

      "content": "<question>QUESTION: There are 14 red crayons, 5 more blue crayons than red crayons, and 6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons.  How many yellow crayons are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 32.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:5+14=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)-6=32 crayons\n#### 32\n(A): 44.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:14+5=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)+6=44 crayons\n#### 44</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\n<thinking>\nThe key difference between the two answers is in how they interpret the phrase \"6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons\". \n\nAnswer A interprets this as:\nYellow = 2 * Blue + 6\nWhile Answer B interprets it as:\nYellow = 2 * Blue - 6\n\nTo determine which is correct, I'll substitute the known values and see which equation holds true.\n\nWe know:\nRed = 14\nBlue = Red + 5 = 14 + 5 = 19\n\nPlugging into Answer A's equation:\nYellow = 2 * 19 + 6 = 38 + 6 = 44\nThis matches the value of 44 yellow crayons given in Answer A.\n\nPlugging into Answer B's equation:\nYellow = 2 * 19 - 6 = 38 - 6 = 32 \nThis matches the 32 yellow crayons in Answer B.\n\nSo both equations are consistent with their respective answers. The deciding factor is the meaning of the phrase \"6 less than\". Linguistically, \"X less than Y\" means Y - X, not Y + X.\n\nTherefore, Answer B's interpretation of:\nYellow = 2 * Blue - 6 \nappears to be the correct reading of the problem statement.\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the problem, there are 6 less yellow crayons than double the number of blue crayons. Mathematically, this means:\n\nYellow = 2 * Blue - 6\n\nWe're told there are 14 red crayons, and 5 more blue crayons than red. So:\n\nBlue = Red + 5 = 14 + 5 = 19 \n\nPlugging this into the equation for yellow:\n\nYellow = 2 * 19 - 6\n           = 38 - 6\n           = 32\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that there are 32 yellow crayons, as stated in Answer B. The phrasing \"6 less than double the blue\" clearly indicates subtraction, not addition as assumed in Answer A.\n\n</transcript>"

          "content": "Here is my argument in favor of answer B:\n\nThe problem states there are \"6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons.\" This wording unambiguously means we should subtract 6 from double the number of blue crayons to get the number of yellow crayons.\n\nWe know there are 14 red crayons, and 5 more blue than red. So:\nBlue = 14 + 5 = 19\n\nTo get the number of yellow crayons, we double the 19 blue crayons and subtract 6:\nYellow = 2 * 19 - 6 = 38 - 6 = 32\n\nThis matches answer B exactly. Answer A makes the mistake of adding 6 instead of subtracting. But the problem clearly states \"6 less\" which can only mean subtraction.\n\nIf the problem had instead said \"6 more than double the blue crayons\", then answer A would be correct. But it specifically says \"6 less than\", which leaves no doubt that answer B, 32 yellow crayons, is the one and only correct answer.",
