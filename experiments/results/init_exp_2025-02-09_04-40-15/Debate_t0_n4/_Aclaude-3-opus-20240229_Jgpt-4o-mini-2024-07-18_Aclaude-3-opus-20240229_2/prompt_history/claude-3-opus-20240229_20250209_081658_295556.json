Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Six tiles are purple and the remaining tiles are white.  How many white tiles are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 7.0\nThere are 3 + 1 = 4 blue tiles.\nThere are a total of 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 tiles are yellow, blue, and purple.\nHence, 20 - 13 = 7 tiles are white.\n#### 7\n(B): 10.0\nThe yellow and blue tiles together total 3 + 1 = 4 tiles.\nAdding the purple tiles gives us 4 + 6 = 10 colored tiles.\nTherefore, 20 - 10 = 10 tiles must be white.\n#### 10</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"

Calculate the number of blue tiles based on the number of yellow tiles\n2. Sum up the number of yellow, blue, and purple tiles\n3. Subtract that sum from the total number of tiles to get the number of white tiles\n\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful for steps 1-3 to perform the calculations.
