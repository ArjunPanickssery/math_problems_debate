Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If he takes 20 trips a day, how many bags does he deliver in 5 days?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 1000.0\nJames delivers 10 x 20 = 200 bags a day.\nSo, he can deliver 200 x 5 = 1000 bags in 5 days.\n#### 1000\n(A): 20000\nTo find the total bags delivered:\nFirst, let's find how many bags per day: 10 bags \u00d7 20 trips = 200 bags\nNow we need to account for all trips over 5 days: 200 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 5 = 20000 bags\n#### 20000</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"
