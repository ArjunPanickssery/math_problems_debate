Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question states that for every dozen flowers bought, the customer gets 2 free flowers. Maria is buying 3 dozens of flowers. \nTo calculate the total number of flowers Maria will have:\n1. Calculate the number of flowers in 3 dozens (without the free ones): 3 * 12 = 36 flowers\n2. Calculate the number of free flowers Maria gets for buying 3 dozens. She gets 2 free for each dozen, so 3 * 2 = 6 free flowers total.\n3. Add the regular flowers and free flowers together: 36 + 6 = 42 total flowers\nThe math_eval tool is not needed here as the calculations are straightforward. \n</thinking>\n\nThe correct answer is (A) 42 flowers. Here's why:\n\nMaria is buying 3 dozens of flowers. Each dozen has 12 flowers, so the number of flowers she is buying is:\n3 * 12 = 36 flowers\n\nFor each dozen bought, Maria gets 2 free flowers. Since she is buying 3 dozens, the number of free flowers is: \n3 * 2 = 6 free flowers\n\nTo get the total, we add the flowers she bought to the free flowers:\n36 + 6 = 42 total flowers\n\nThe problem states she gets 2 free for each dozen bought. It does not say she gets an additional 2 free on top of that for the whole purchase. So the total is 42 flowers, not 44.",
