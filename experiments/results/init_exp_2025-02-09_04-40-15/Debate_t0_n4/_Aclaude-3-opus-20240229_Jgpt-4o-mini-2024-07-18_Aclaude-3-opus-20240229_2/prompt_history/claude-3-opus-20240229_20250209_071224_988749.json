          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key point of contention between the two answers is whether the school should pay for robes for all 30 singers, or only for the 18 additional robes they need to buy.\n\nTo determine which interpretation is correct, I'll carefully re-read the question. The question states:\n\"Currently, the school has only 12 robes so they decided to buy the rest. If each robe costs $2, how much will the school spend?\"\n\nThe phrase \"buy the rest\" suggests they are only buying the additional robes needed, not re-buying robes for all 30 singers. If they were buying robes for everyone, the question would have likely said something like \"buy robes for each singer\" instead of \"buy the rest\".\n\nTherefore, I believe Answer A, which calculates the cost for the 18 additional robes needed, is the correct interpretation of the question. I will argue this point to the best of my ability.\n</thinking>\n\nThe question clearly states that the school currently has 12 robes and needs to \"buy the rest.\" This phrasing indicates they are only buying the additional robes needed to outfit all 30 singers, not re-buying robes for the 12 singers who already have them.\n\nIf the school was buying robes for all 30 singers from scratch, the question would have been worded differently, such as \"buy robes for each singer\" or \"outfit all 30 singers with new robes.\" The specific mention of the 12 existing robes sets the context that they only need to purchase the remaining ones.\n\nTherefore, to calculate the amount the school will spend, we first find the number of additional robes to buy: ",
