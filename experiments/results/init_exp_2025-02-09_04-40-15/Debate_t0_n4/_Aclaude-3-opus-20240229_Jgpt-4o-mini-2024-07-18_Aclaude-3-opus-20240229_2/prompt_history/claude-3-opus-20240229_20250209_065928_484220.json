Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Calculate the total height gain in inches (2 inches per month for 3 months)\n2. Add the height gain to John's original height to get his final height in inches \n3. Convert the final height from inches to feet by dividing by 12\n\nThe question provides John's original height (66 inches) and the height gain per month (2 inches) for 3 months.
