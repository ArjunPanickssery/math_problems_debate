Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question is asking how many chocolate bars Mike and Rita got combined if a box of 12 bars was shared equally between Mike, Rita and Anita. \n\nThe key information is:\n- There are 12 chocolate bars total\n- The bars are shared equally between 3 people (Mike, Rita, Anita)\n- We need to find how many bars Mike and Rita got together\n\nTo calculate this, we first need to determine how many bars each person got individually. This can be done by dividing the total number of bars (12) by the number of people (3).\n\n12 / 3 = 4 \n\nSo each person got 4 bars.\n\nSince the question is asking about Mike and Rita's bars combined, we just need to add their individual amounts together.\n\nMike's bars + Rita's bars = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Mike and Rita got 8 bars combined. No tools are needed, as the calculation is straightforward.\n</thinking>\n\nSince the box of 12 chocolate bars was shared equally between Mike, Rita and Anita, that means each person got an equal number of bars. To calculate how many bars each person received, we simply divide the total bars by the number of people:",
