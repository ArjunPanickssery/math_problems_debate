Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question provides a ratio of 2:1:3 for how Sam shared money between Sandra, Amy, and Ruth respectively. It also states that Amy got $50. To determine how much Sandra got, we need to use the ratio and the amount Amy received.\n\nThe two possible answers interpret the ratio differently:\n(A) assumes that Sandra's share is 2 times Amy's amount, so $50 * 2 = $100\n(B) assumes that Sandra's share is Amy's amount divided by 2, so $50 / 2 = $25\n\nTo determine which interpretation is correct, I would need to know more about how ratios work mathematically. I don't have enough information to confidently argue for answer (B) being correct.\n</thinking>",
