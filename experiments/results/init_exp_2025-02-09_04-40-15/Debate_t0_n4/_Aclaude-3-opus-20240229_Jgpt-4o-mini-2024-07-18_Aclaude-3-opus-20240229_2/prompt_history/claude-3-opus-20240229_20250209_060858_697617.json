Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Take 1/4 of the red jelly beans to get the number of coconut flavored ones\n\nMy assigned answer (B) follows this correct approach:\n- It first calculates 3/4 of 4000 to get 3000 red jelly beans \n- Then it takes 1/4 of 3000 to determine there are 750 coconut flavored jelly beans\n\nThe other answer (A) makes the mistake of taking 1/4 of the total jelly beans, not 1/4 of just the red ones. It assumes all the coconut ones are part of that 1/4 of the total.\n\nSo my answer follows the problem statement correctly, while the other answer makes an incorrect assumption. I have the information I need to make a strong argument for my answer being correct.\n</thinking>\n\nMy answer of 750 coconut flavored jelly beans is correct. The problem states that three fourths of the 4000 total jelly beans are red. To calculate that:",
