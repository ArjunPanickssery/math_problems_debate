Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many foreign objects total are caught in the dog's fur?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 84.0\nFirst find how many burrs are caught in the dog's fur: 12 burrs * 6 ticks/burr = 72 ticks\nThen add the number of burrs to find the total number objects: 72 objects + 12 objects = 84 objects\n#### 84\n(B): 30.0\nFirst find how many ticks are caught in the dog's fur: 12 burrs + 6 = 18 ticks\nThen add the number of burrs to find the total number of objects: 18 ticks + 12 burrs = 30 objects\n#### 30</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"
