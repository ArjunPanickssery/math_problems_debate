Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The total cost of the pants (price per pair * number of pairs)\n2. The total cost of the shirts (price per shirt * number of shirts) \n3. The overall total cost (pants total + shirts total)\n4. The change (amount given - total cost)\n\nNo additional tools are needed, as basic arithmetic can be done mentally. The key will be doing the calculations correctly.\n</thinking>\n\nThe correct answer is (B): $10 change. Here's why:\n\nLaura bought 2 pairs of pants at $54 each. So the total cost for the pants is:\n2 * $54 = $108\n\nShe also bought 4 shirts at $33 each. The total cost for the shirts is: \n4 * $33 = $132\n\nAdding these together gives the total purchase price:\n$108 + $132 = $240\n\nSince Laura gave the cashier $250, the change she should receive is:\n$250 - $240 = $10\n\nTherefore, the cashier should have given Laura $10 in change, making answer (B) correct.",
