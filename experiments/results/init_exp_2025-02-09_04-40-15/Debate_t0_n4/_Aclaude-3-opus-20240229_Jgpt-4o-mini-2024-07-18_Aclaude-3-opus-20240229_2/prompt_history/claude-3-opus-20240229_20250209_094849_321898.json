Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

      "content": "<question>QUESTION: Susie's pet lizard Moe takes 10 seconds to eat 40 pieces of cuttlebone each day. How long would it take Moe to eat 800 pieces?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 200.0\nIf it takes Moe 10 seconds to eat 40 cuttlebones, then in one second she eats 40 cuttlebones / 10 seconds = 4 cuttlebones/second\nSince the cat eats 4 pieces of cuttlebone in 1 second, 800 pieces will be 800 cuttlebones / 4 cuttlebones/second = 200 seconds.\n#### 200\n(A): 320.0\nFirst, we need to find how many seconds it takes per piece of cuttlebone:\n10 seconds / 40 pieces = 0.25 seconds per piece\nThen we multiply this rate by the total number of pieces:\n800 pieces * 0.25 seconds/piece = 320 seconds\n#### 320</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"

      "content": "<thinking>\nThe key to solving this problem is determining the rate at which Moe eats cuttlebones. We are given that Moe takes 10 seconds to eat 40 pieces. To find the rate, we can divide the number of pieces by the time:\n\n40 pieces / 10 seconds = 4 pieces/second\n\nThis means that Moe eats 4 pieces of cuttlebone per second. Now that we have the rate, we can calculate how long it would take Moe to eat 800 pieces by dividing 800 by the rate:\n\n800 pieces / (4 pieces/second) = 200 seconds\n\nSo the math_eval tool could be used to perform this calculation and confirm that 200 seconds is the correct answer.\n</thinking>",
