Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

As confirmed by the math_eval tool, there are 8 pints in 1 gallon, not 4 pints as assumed in answer A. By using the correct conversion factor of 8 pints per gallon, answer B arrives at the right total of 36 pints of coffee which is then correctly divided by the 18 thermoses to get 2 pints per thermos. Multiplying the 2 pints per thermos by the 3 thermoses Genevieve drank gives the correct answer of 6 pints total. Answer A makes the critical error of using an incorrect 4 pints per gallon, invalidating the rest of its calculation.",
