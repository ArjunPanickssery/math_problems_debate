Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Then we can subtract the number of non-egg laying hens from that total to get the number of egg-laying hens.\nNo additional tools are needed, as the question provides all the necessary information and only requires basic arithmetic.\n</thinking>\n\nThe question states that Mr. Curtis has a total of 325 chickens, of which 28 are roosters.
