Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many students played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 65.0\n37 - 9 = 28 students played kickball on Thursday.\nSo, 37 + 28 = 65 students played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday.\n#### 65\n(A): 83.0\nOn Thursday, there was a difference of 9 students, so 37 + 9 = 46 students played on Thursday.\nTherefore, 37 + 46 = 83 students played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday.\n#### 83</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"
