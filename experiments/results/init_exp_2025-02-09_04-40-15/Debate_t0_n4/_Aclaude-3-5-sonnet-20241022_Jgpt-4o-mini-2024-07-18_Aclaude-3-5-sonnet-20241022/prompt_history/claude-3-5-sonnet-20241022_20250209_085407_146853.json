Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

When we say \"twice more,\" we're expressing a direct multiplicative relationship.

The opponent's interpretation incorrectly adds twice the amount instead of multiplying, which leads to an inflated result that misinterprets the meaning of \"twice more.\"\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe phrase \"twice more\" specifically means adding twice the original amount to the base amount. This is different from \"twice as many,\" which would mean multiplication. Let me break it down:\n\n1. Oli has 4 scoops (base amount)\n2. \"Twice more\" means adding 2 \u00d7 4 = 8 more scoops\n3. Total for Victoria: 4 + 8 = 12 scoops<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"12 - 4\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\nTherefore, Victoria has 8 more scoops than Oli. The opponent's interpretation confuses \"twice more\" with \"twice as many,\" leading to an underestimation. In everyday language, when we say \"twice more,\" we mean adding twice the amount, not just doubling it.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe phrase \"twice more\" is unambiguously a multiplicative relationship, not an additive one. This is supported by standard mathematical interpretation and common usage. Consider these examples: \"twice more expensive\" means double the price, not triple. \"Twice more time\" means double the duration, not triple. Let me demonstrate why Victoria has 8 scoops:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 8,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe phrase \"twice more\" is unambiguously a multiplicative relationship, not an additive one.
