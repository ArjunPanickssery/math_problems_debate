If Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked, how many apples did Kayla pick?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 274.0\nLet x be the number of apples Kylie picked\nKayla picked 10+4x apples\n340=x+(10+4x)\n340=5x+10\n330=5x\nx=66 apples\nKayla picked 10+4(66)=274 apples\n#### 274\n(B): 280\nLet x be the number of apples Kylie picked\nKayla picked 4(x+10) apples\n340=x+4(x+10)\n340=x+4x+40\n340=5x+40\n300=5x\nx=60 apples\nKayla picked 4(60+10)=4(70)=280 apples\n#### 280</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe key to understanding why 274 is correct lies in carefully interpreting the phrase \"10 more than 4 times the amount.\" This should be interpreted as (4x + 10), where x is Kylie's amount. Let me demonstrate:\n\nLet's solve this step by step:\n1. Total apples = 340\n2. Kylie's apples = x\n3. Kayla's apples = 4x + 10 (4 times Kylie's amount, plus 10)\n4. Therefore: x + (4x + 10) = 340\n\nLet's verify the solution:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"5 * 66\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"5 * 66\"},\n    \"result\": 330,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe key to understanding why 274 is correct lies in carefully interpreting the phrase \"10 more than 4 times the amount.\" This should be interpreted as (4x + 10), where x is Kylie's amount. Let me demonstrate:\n\nLet's solve this step by step:\n1. Total apples = 340\n2. Kylie's apples = x\n3. Kayla's apples = 4x + 10 (4 times Kylie's amount, plus 10)\n4. Therefore: x + (4x + 10) = 340\n\nLet's verify the solution:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"5 * 66\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"5 * 66\"},\n    \"result\": 330,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4 * 66 + 10\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4 * 66 + 10\"},\n    \"result\": 274,\n}\n</tool_result>\n<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4 * 66 + 10\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4 * 66 + 10\"},\n    \"result\": 274,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThis gives us Kylie picking 66 apples and Kayla picking 274 apples, which adds up to 340 total. The alternative interpretation of 4(x+10) is mathematically incorrect as it changes the meaning of \"10 more than 4 times the amount.\"\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe interpretation of \"10 more than 4 times the amount\" as 4(x+10) is actually the correct mathematical translation of the English phrase. Here's why:\n\nWhen we say \"4 times the amount,\" we need to first establish what \"the amount\" refers to. In this case, \"the amount\" is \"Kylie's picks plus 10.\" The phrase structure tells us to first add 10 to Kylie's amount, then multiply that sum by 4.\n\nLet's verify our solution:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"60 + 280\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"60 + 280\"},\n    \"result\": 340,\n}\n</tool_result>\n\nWith x=60, Kylie picked 60 apples and Kayla picked 4(60+10)=280 apples, totaling exactly 340. The opponent's interpretation of 4x+10 incorrectly applies the \"10 more\" after the multiplication, which doesn't match the natural language order of operations in the question.\n\n</transcript>"

Let me explain why:\n\nThe phrase can be broken down into two operations:\n1. \"4 times the amount\" = 4x\n2. \"10 more than\" = add 10 to the previous result\n\nThe opponent's interpretation of 4(x+10) suggests that the \"10 more\" applies before multiplication, which contradicts the order stated in the question. If we wanted their interpretation, the question would have been phrased as \"4 times (the amount plus 10).\"\n\nLet's verify that our solution satisfies all conditions:",
