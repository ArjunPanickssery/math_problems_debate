Answer B incorrectly uses perimeter calculations, which measures the distance around the shapes rather than the space they occupy. Area is the correct measure for determining uncovered space in two dimensions.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe question is asking about uncovered space, which is best understood as the gap between the block and the box's edges. When placing a square block in a rectangular container, we should focus on the perimeter measurement, as this represents the actual empty space around the block. The box's perimeter is:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"(4 + 6) * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\nThe block's perimeter is:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4 * 4\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\nThe difference of 4 represents the actual uncovered space between the block and box. Using area calculations would be misleading because it counts spaces that aren't actually accessible or visible as \"uncovered.\" The perimeter method better represents the actual empty space that can be observed around the block.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nI'll argue for Answer A (8 square inches).\n\nThe opponent's perimeter-based argument fundamentally misunderstands the concept of uncovered space. When we place objects in containers, uncovered space refers to the viewable area from above - like looking down into the shoebox. Let's break this down:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4 * 6\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4 * 6\"},\n    \"result\": 24,\n}\n</tool_result>\nI'll argue for Answer A (8 square inches).\n\nThe opponent's perimeter-based argument fundamentally misunderstands the concept of uncovered space.

Using perimeter would give us linear inches, not square inches as explicitly requested in the question. The opponent's argument is mathematically invalid because it mixes units - you cannot subtract a perimeter from a perimeter to get a square measurement.\n\n</transcript>"

In reality, these corner spaces aren't separately accessible.\n\n3.
