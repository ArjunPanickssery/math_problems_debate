They're adding $20 each time instead of doubling the previous amount. \"Twice as much\" clearly means multiplication by 2, not addition. The correct progression follows exponential growth (\u00d72 each month), not linear growth (+ constant amount). Therefore, $160 is the correct answer for May's savings.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nWhen Brianne \"saves twice as much,\" this means she's adding twice the previous amount to her existing savings each month. Let's track the cumulative savings:\n\nJanuary: $10\nFebruary: $10 + (2 \u00d7 $10) = $30\nMarch: $30 + (2 \u00d7 $30) = $90\nApril: $90 + (2 \u00d7 $90) = $270\nMay: $270 + (2 \u00d7 $270) = $810\n\nThe opponent's interpretation is incorrect because they're only considering the new savings in isolation. When we \"save twice as much,\" we're adding twice the previous month's total to our running balance. This is why we see faster growth - it's not just doubling the previous month's number, but adding twice that amount to our accumulated savings. The $810 answer correctly reflects this compounding effect.\n\n</transcript>"
