The question states \"3 fewer 8 string guitars than the normal guitars.\" Since there are 6 normal guitars (2 times 3 basses), we subtract 3 to get 3 eight-string guitars. Let me demonstrate with calculations:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"3 * 4\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"3 * 4\"},\n    \"result\": 12,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe key to understanding this problem lies in carefully parsing the language about the 8-string guitars.

The opposing argument misinterprets \"3 fewer\" to mean there should be 6 eight-string guitars, which contradicts the plain meaning of the text. When we say \"3 fewer than 6,\" we mean 3, not 6.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe phrase \"3 fewer 8 string guitars than the normal guitars\" means we start with the number of normal guitars (6) and subtract 3 from that number, giving us 3 eight-string guitars. This interpretation ignores the crucial comparative nature of the phrase. In English, when we say \"X fewer than Y,\" we're establishing a relationship between two quantities, where Y is our reference point. The correct interpretation is that if we have 6 normal guitars, we should have 6 eight-string guitars, just with 3 fewer of them, meaning 6-3=3 eight-string guitars. This aligns with standard English usage and mathematical logic, making 72 strings the correct total.\n\n</transcript>"
