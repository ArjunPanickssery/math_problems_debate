If three fourths of the jelly beans are red, and one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, how many jelly beans are coconut flavored?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 750.0\nThere are 4000/4*3=3000 red jelly beans.\nThere are 3000/4=750 coconut flavored jelly beans.\n#### 750\n(A): 1000.0\nFirst find one quarter of all jelly beans: 4000/4 = 1000\nSince these coconut ones must be among the red ones, and three fourths are red, \nthe coconut flavored ones are: 1000\n#### 1000</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe solution is clearly 750 coconut-flavored jelly beans. Let's break this down mathematically. We know that three-fourths of 4,000 jelly beans are red, which can be calculated as:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4000 * 3/4\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4000 * 3/4\"},\n    \"result\": 3000.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe solution is clearly 750 coconut-flavored jelly beans. Let's break this down mathematically. We know that three-fourths of 4,000 jelly beans are red, which can be calculated as:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4000 * 3/4\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4000 * 3/4\"},\n    \"result\": 3000.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThis gives us 3,000 red jelly beans. Now, one quarter of these red jelly beans are coconut flavored:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"3000 * 1/4\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"3000 * 1/4\"},\n    \"result\": 750.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThis gives us 3,000 red jelly beans. Now, one quarter of these red jelly beans are coconut flavored:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"3000 * 1/4\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"3000 * 1/4\"},\n    \"result\": 750.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe answer must be 750 because we need to first establish the subset of red jelly beans before calculating the coconut-flavored portion. The opposing solution incorrectly applies the one-quarter fraction to the total number of jelly beans rather than to just the red ones, which is specifically what the question asks for.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe answer is 1,000 coconut-flavored jelly beans. The key insight is that the question provides two independent facts: three-fourths are red, and one-quarter are coconut flavored. The order of these facts doesn't imply we should calculate them sequentially. When we're told \"one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored,\" this is mathematically equivalent to saying that one-quarter of all jelly beans are both red AND coconut flavored. Therefore, we simply need to calculate one-quarter of 4,000:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4000 * 1/4\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\nThis gives us 1,000 coconut-flavored jelly beans. The opponent's solution incorrectly assumes we need to calculate these fractions in sequence, which would result in an overly small number of coconut jelly beans.\n\n</transcript>"
