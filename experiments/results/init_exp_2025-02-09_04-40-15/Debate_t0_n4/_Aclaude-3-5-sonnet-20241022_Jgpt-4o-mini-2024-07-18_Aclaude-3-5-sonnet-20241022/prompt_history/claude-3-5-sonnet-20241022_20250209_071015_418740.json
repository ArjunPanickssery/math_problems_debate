Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The key is understanding the reference point. The problem establishes Mr. Chiu as the base reference with 56 dollars, and subsequent relationships should be calculated from there. Mr. Phung has 72 dollars (16 more than Chiu), and Mr. Ha has 61 dollars (5 more than Chiu's base amount). This interpretation is more logical as it maintains Mr. Chiu as the consistent reference point throughout the problem. The total is therefore 56 + 72 + 61 = 189 dollars. The opponent's interpretation creates an unnecessarily complex chain of relationships when a simpler, more direct solution exists.\n\n</transcript>"
