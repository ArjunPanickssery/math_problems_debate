Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

When we say \"twice as many after dinner,\" we're referring to doubling the total, not adding double. Let me demonstrate:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"1 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"1 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 2,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe key is understanding what \"twice as many\" means in this context.

This is similar to how we say \"twice the price\" means the final price, not additional. The phrase \"twice as many\" indicates a total multiplication, not an addition to the original amount. Therefore, 2 bags is the correct total.\n\n</transcript>"

          "content": "The opponent's interpretation is incorrect. When we say \"twice as many after dinner,\" it clearly means he ate double the amount as a separate event after dinner. Let's break it down:\n\n1. During dinner: 1 bag\n2. After dinner: 2 bags (twice as many as during dinner)\n<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"1 + (2 * 1)\"}\n}\n</tool_call>\n\nTotal = 3 bags. The phrase \"after dinner\" is crucial here - it indicates these are separate events, not a total multiplication. If the question meant the total was twice as much, it would have been phrased differently, like \"John ate twice as many bags in total.\" The sequential nature of the events (dinner, then after dinner) supports adding the quantities rather than just doubling the initial amount.",
