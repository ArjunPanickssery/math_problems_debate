Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

My opponent's answer B incorrectly calculates using just one 3-hour period per trip. Let me demonstrate the correct calculation:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"3 * 2 * 12\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"3 * 2 * 12\"},\n    \"result\": 72,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe question clearly states that Melissa takes 3 hours for the ENTIRE round trip (\"3 hours to drive to town and back\"), not 3 hours each way. My opponent's answer B incorrectly calculates using just one 3-hour period per trip.

So monthly driving time is 6 hours. Over 12 months, this equals 72 hours per year. Answer B is clearly correct and mathematically sound.\n\n</transcript>"
