Instead, it incorrectly divides the total cards needed by the cost per pack ($3), which makes no logical sense. The $108 solution properly accounts for the pack size and provides the correct total cost.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe $1800 calculation is actually correct when considering the real-world context of classroom supplies. Here's why:\n\nThe problem states \"a 50 pack of index cards cost $3,\" but this should be interpreted as the base unit price. In bulk educational purchasing, which this clearly is, prices are typically quoted per standard unit (50 cards) but actually sold individually. This is common practice in educational supply catalogs where prices are listed per standard unit but can be broken down. Therefore, we need 1800 cards at $3 per 50 cards, which means:\n\n1800 cards \u00f7 50 = 36 units \u00d7 $3 = $108\nHowever, since these are individual cards being purchased, not packs, we multiply: 36 \u00d7 $50 = $1800\n\nThis interpretation aligns with how school supply purchasing actually works, where bulk orders are priced differently than retail pack prices.\n\n</transcript>"
