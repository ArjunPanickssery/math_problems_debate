Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many more scoops of ice cream does Victoria have than Oli?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nVictoria has 4 x 2 = 8 scoops of ice cream.\nTherefore, Victoria has 8 - 4 = 4 more scoops of ice cream than Oli.\n#### 4\n(A): 8.0\nVictoria's scoops can be calculated as 4 + (2 \u00d7 4) = 4 + 8 = 12 scoops of ice cream.\nTherefore, Victoria has 12 - 4 = 8 more scoops than Oli.\n#### 8</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe phrase \"twice more\" is key here - it means adding twice the original amount, not just doubling. When we say \"twice more,\" we're saying Victoria has her original portion (4) PLUS two times Oli's portion (2 \u00d7 4). Let me demonstrate with math:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4 + (2 * 4)\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"4 + (2 * 4)\"},\n    \"result\": 12,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe phrase \"twice more\" is key here - it means adding twice the original amount, not just doubling.
