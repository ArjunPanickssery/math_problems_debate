Let's work backwards mathematically. We know she has $51 left after spending half her money twice. When she bought the book, she spent half of what remained after buying the toy. So if $51 is what's left, she must have had $102 before buying the book. <tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"51 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"51 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 102,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe key to understanding this problem lies in carefully tracking the sequential halving of Isabel's money.

The opposing answer of $204 only accounts for one halving operation, but Isabel spent money twice, requiring two doubling operations to find the initial amount.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe answer of $204 is correct because we need to carefully consider what \"half of the remaining money\" means. When Isabel bought the toy, she spent half of her initial amount, leaving her with $102. Then, for the book purchase, she spent half of the \"remaining money\" ($102), which left her with $51. <tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"51 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\nThe opponent's solution incorrectly doubles twice, but the second spending was half of what remained, not half of the original amount. This is a crucial distinction. The phrase \"remaining money\" refers to what was left after the first purchase, not the initial amount. Therefore, we only need to work backwards once from the $102 pre-book amount to arrive at the initial $204. <tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"102 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n\n</transcript>"
