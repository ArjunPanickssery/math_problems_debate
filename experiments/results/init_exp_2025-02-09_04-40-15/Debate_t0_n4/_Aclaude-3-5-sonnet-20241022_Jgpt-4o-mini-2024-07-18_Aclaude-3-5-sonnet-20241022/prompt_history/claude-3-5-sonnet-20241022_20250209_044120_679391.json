Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

When Isaac cuts the ribbon into 6 parts, he's actually dividing it into 4 usable sections and 2 separate sections. This is evident because we know he specifically \"used 4 parts,\" suggesting these were pre-determined as the main sections. Therefore, the total length of 30 meters should be divided by 4 to get the length of each intended usable part:",
