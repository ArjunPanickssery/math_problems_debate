Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many are slightly used?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 56.0\nNew:120/3=40 crayons\nBroken:120(.20)=24 crayons\nSlightly Used:120-40-24=56 crayons\n#### 56\n(A): 64.0\nNew:120/3=40 crayons\nRemaining:120-40=80 crayons\nBroken:80(.20)=16 crayons\nSlightly Used:80-16=64 crayons\n#### 64</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe calculation method in answer B is the correct approach because it treats each category independently from the total of 120 crayons. Let's verify:\n\nFirst, we find one-third of 120 for new crayons:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120/3\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120/3\"},\n    \"result\": 40.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe calculation method in answer B is the correct approach because it treats each category independently from the total of 120 crayons. Let's verify:\n\nFirst, we find one-third of 120 for new crayons:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120/3\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120/3\"},\n    \"result\": 40.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThen 20% of 120 for broken crayons:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120*0.2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120*0.2\"},\n    \"result\": 24.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThen 20% of 120 for broken crayons:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120*0.2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120*0.2\"},\n    \"result\": 24.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nTherefore, slightly used is:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120-40-24\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120-40-24\"},\n    \"result\": 56,\n}\n</tool_result>\nTherefore, slightly used is:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120-40-24\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120-40-24\"},\n    \"result\": 56,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe percentages should be calculated from the total number of crayons (120) because the question states these as independent conditions. Answer A incorrectly assumes the 20% broken applies only to the remaining crayons after removing new ones, which wasn't specified in the question. The conditions are stated separately, so they should be calculated separately from the total.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct approach is to calculate the broken crayons from the remaining crayons after removing the new ones, as shown in answer A. Here's why:\n\nWhen the question states \"the rest are slightly used,\" it establishes a sequential logic. First, we remove one-third (40) new crayons, leaving 80 crayons. The 20% broken must apply to these remaining 80 crayons because they're the only ones that could be broken (new crayons wouldn't be broken). This gives us 16 broken crayons (20% of 80), leaving 64 slightly used.\n\nAnswer B's approach is flawed because it assumes new crayons can be broken, which doesn't make logical sense. The 20% broken must apply to the non-new crayons only, making 64 the correct answer for slightly used crayons.\n\n</transcript>"
