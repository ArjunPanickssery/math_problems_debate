Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If the shortest piece is 16 cm, how long was the entire wire before it was cut?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 96.0\nSince the shortest part is consists of 2 parts, then each part is equal to 16 cm/2 = 8 cm.\nThe whole wire was cut into 7 + 3 + 2 = 12 parts.\nHence, the wire was 8 cm x 12 = 96 cm long\n#### 96\n(B): 64\nIf we take the middle piece (ratio 3) as 16 cm, then each unit length is 16 \u00f7 3 = 5.33... cm\nFor ratio 7: 7 \u00d7 5.33... = 37.33... cm\nFor ratio 3: 16 cm\nFor ratio 2: 2 \u00d7 5.33... = 10.67... cm\nTotal length = 37.33... + 16 + 10.67... = 64 cm\n#### 64</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"
