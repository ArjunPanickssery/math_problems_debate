Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The question states that 5 more than half the cows are black. This means we need to find half of the total number of cows, which is 18, and then add 5 to that number to determine the number of black cows.\n\n18 divided by 2 equals 9, which is half the total number of cows. Adding 5 to 9 gives us 14, which is the number of black cows.\n\nTo find the number of non-black cows, we subtract the number of black cows from the total number of cows: 18 - 14 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A): 4 cows are not black.",
