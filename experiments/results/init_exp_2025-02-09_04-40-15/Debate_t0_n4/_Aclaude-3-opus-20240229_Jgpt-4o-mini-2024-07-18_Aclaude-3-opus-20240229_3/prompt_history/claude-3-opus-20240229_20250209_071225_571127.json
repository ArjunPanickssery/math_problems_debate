Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The correct answer is (A): 64.0 apples. Here's why:\n\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate. We know that Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara, which means A = 4S. We also know that together they ate a total of 80 apples, so A + S = 80.\n\nSubstituting A with 4S in the second equation, we get:\n4S + S = 80\n5S = 80\nS = 16\n\nSince S represents the number of apples Sara ate, we can conclude that Sara ate 16 apples. And since Ali ate 4 times more, he must have eaten 4 \u00d7 16 = 64 apples.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Sara ate 64 apples.",
