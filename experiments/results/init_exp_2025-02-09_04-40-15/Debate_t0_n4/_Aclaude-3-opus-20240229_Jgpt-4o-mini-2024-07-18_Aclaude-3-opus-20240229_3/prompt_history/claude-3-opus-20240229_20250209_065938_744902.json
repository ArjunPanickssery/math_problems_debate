Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "I believe that answer A, 274 apples, is correct. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\nLet x represent the number of apples Kylie picked. We are told that Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the amount Kylie picked. This can be expressed as:\n\nKayla's apples = 4x + 10\n\nTogether, Kylie and Kayla picked a total of 340 apples. We can set up an equation:\n\nKylie's apples + Kayla's apples = 340\nx + (4x + 10) = 340\n\nSimplifying:\n5x + 10 = 340\n5x = 330\nx = 66\n\nSo Kylie picked 66 apples. Plugging this back into the expression for Kayla's apples:\n\nKayla's apples = 4(66) + 10 = 264 + 10 = 274\n\nTherefore, Kayla picked 274 apples, making answer A correct.",
