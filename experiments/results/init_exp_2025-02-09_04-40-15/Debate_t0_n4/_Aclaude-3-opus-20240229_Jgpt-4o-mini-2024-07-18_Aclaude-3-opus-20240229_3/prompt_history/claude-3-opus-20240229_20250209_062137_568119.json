Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The correct answer is 4 pieces of rope. Here's why:\n\nTom needs to lower a rope down 6 stories, and each story is 10 feet. So the total length of rope he needs is 6 * 10 = 60 feet.\n\nHowever, when lashing the ropes together, he loses 25% of each rope's length. Each rope is 20 feet long, so he loses 20 * 0.25 = 5 feet per rope.\n\nTherefore, the effective length of each rope after lashing is 20 - 5 = 15 feet.\n\nTo calculate the number of ropes needed, we divide the total length required by the effective length of each rope: 60 feet / 15 feet per rope = 4 ropes.\n\nSo Tom needs to buy 4 pieces of rope to have enough to lower down 6 stories.",
