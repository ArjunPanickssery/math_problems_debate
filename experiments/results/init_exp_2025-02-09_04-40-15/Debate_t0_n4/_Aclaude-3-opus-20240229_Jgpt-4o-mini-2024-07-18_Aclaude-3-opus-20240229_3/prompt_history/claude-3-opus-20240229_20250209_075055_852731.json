Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The two shorter CDs are each 1.5 hours long, for a total of 3 hours. The last CD is twice as long as one of the shorter CDs, which means it is 2 * 1.5 = 3 hours long. Therefore, the total combined length of the CDs is 1.5 + 1.5 + 3 = 4.5 hours. The key point is that the longer CD is twice the length of one of the shorter CDs, not twice the combined length of both shorter CDs. So the correct answer is 4.5 hours.",
