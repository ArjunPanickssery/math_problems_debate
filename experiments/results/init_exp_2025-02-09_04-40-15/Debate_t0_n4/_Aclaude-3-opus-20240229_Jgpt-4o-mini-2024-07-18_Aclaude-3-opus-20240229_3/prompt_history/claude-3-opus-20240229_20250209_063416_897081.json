Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The question states that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. This means that Amanda currently has 12 fewer marbles than twice Katrina's amount. \n\nWe know Mabel has 85 marbles, which is 5 times Katrina's amount. So Katrina must have 85/5 = 17 marbles.\n\nTwice Katrina's amount is 17 * 2 = 34 marbles. Since Amanda has 12 fewer than this, she must have 34 - 12 = 22 marbles currently.\n\nTherefore, the difference between Mabel's 85 marbles and Amanda's 22 marbles is 85 - 22 = 63 marbles. So answer choice (A) 63 is correct.",
