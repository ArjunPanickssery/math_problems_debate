Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Her total savings are now $10 + $20 = $30.\nIn March, she saves twice her February savings, which is $20 x 2 = $40. Her total savings are now $30 + $40 = $70.\nIn April, she saves twice her March savings, which is $40 x 2 = $80. Her total savings are now $70 + $80 = $150.\nFinally, in May, she saves twice her April savings, which is $80 x 2 = $160. Her total savings are now $150 + $160 = $310.\n\nTherefore, Brianne will save $160 in the month of May, and her total savings from January through May will be $310.",
