Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

      "content": "<question>QUESTION: Lyra bought a pair of shoes at a 20% discount.  If she paid $480, how much was the original price of the pair of shoes?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 600.0\nLyra only paid $480 for the pair of shoes which is only 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.\nSo let x be the original price.\nThen 0.8x = $480\nThus x = $480 / 0.8 = $600\n#### 600\n(A): 576\nThe discount amount is 20% of $480 = $96\nThe original price is $480 + $96 = $576\n#### 576</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe original price is $576, not $600. Here's why:\n\nLyra paid $480 after a 20% discount was applied. To find the original price, we need to add back the discount amount. 20% of $480 is $96 (0.2 * $480 = $96). So the discount was $96.\n\nAdding this $96 discount back to the $480 Lyra paid gives us the original price before the discount: $480 + $96 = $576.\n\nTherefore, the original price of the shoes before the 20% discount was $576.\n\n</transcript>"

          "content": "<thinking>\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding how percentages and discounts work. My opponent's argument makes an error in the calculation.\n\nTo find the original price, we can't just add the discount amount to the discounted price Lyra paid. That would only work if the discount was calculated based on the final price. \n\nBut the 20% discount was taken off the original price, not the discounted price. So we need to work backwards from the discounted price to determine what the original 100% price was before taking 20% off.\n\nI can explain this clearly using the math_eval tool to show the correct calculation.\n</thinking>",
