Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "Company B clearly made $25 more than Company A from selling big bottles of milk. The math is straightforward:\n\nCompany A sold 300 bottles at $4 each, earning a total of $1200.\nCompany B sold 350 bottles at $3.50 each, earning a total of $1225. \n\n$1225 - $1200 = $25\n\nSo Company B earned exactly $25 more than Company A. The $325 figure proposed in the other answer is incorrect - it seems to be calculating the difference in price per bottle multiplied by the total bottles sold, which doesn't make sense and doesn't answer the question of how much more one company made than the other. The question is asking about the difference in total earnings, not the difference in earnings per bottle.",
