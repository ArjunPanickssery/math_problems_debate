Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

It also says she gives away a third of her brown shirts, which is 36/3 = 12 brown shirts. \n\nTherefore, Mary is left with:\n26 - 13 = 13 blue shirts \n36 - 12 = 24 brown shirts\n\nIn total, Mary has 13 + 24 = 37 shirts remaining after giving some away. So the correct answer is 37 shirts, which corresponds to answer choice (B).",
