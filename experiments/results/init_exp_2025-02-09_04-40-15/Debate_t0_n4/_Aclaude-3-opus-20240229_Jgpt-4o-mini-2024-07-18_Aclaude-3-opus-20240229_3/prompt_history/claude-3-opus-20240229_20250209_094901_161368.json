Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The question states that 20 hens do not lay eggs, but this does not mean we should add those 20 non-laying hens to the total. The 297 hens already include both the laying and non-laying hens. To find the number of egg-laying hens specifically, we must subtract the 20 non-laying hens from the total of 297 hens: 297 - 20 = 277.",
