Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many more pairs of shoes does Anthony have compared to Jim?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2.0\nAnthony:7(3)=21\nJim:21-2=19\nAnthony has 21-19=2 more pairs of shoes.\n#### 2\n(B): 6.0\nAnthony:7(3)=21\nJim:5(3)=15\nAnthony has 21-15=6 more pairs of shoes.\n#### 6</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nAnthony has 3 times as many pairs of shoes as Scott, which means Anthony has 7 * 3 = 21 pairs of shoes. Jim has 2 less pairs than Anthony, so Jim has 21 - 2 = 19 pairs of shoes. Therefore, Anthony has 21 - 19 = 2 more pairs of shoes than Jim. The correct answer is 2 pairs, which is answer choice (A).\n\n</transcript>"

How many times more pairs of shoes Anthony has compared to Scott (given as 3 times) \n3. How many fewer pairs of shoes Jim has compared to Anthony (given as 2 less)\n\nWith this information, we can calculate:\n- Anthony's shoe pairs by multiplying Scott's pairs by 3\n- Jim's shoe pairs by subtracting 2 from Anthony's total\n- The difference between Anthony and Jim's shoe pairs\n\nNo additional tools are needed since the question provides all the necessary information and only requires basic arithmetic. The math_eval tool could be used to perform the calculations, but they are simple enough to do without a tool.\n</thinking>",
