Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The calculation for 1000 bags is clearly correct. The problem states James can carry 10 bags per trip and makes 20 trips per day. This means he delivers 200 bags daily (10 \u00d7 20). Over 5 days, this totals 1000 bags (200 \u00d7 5). The opposing calculation erroneously multiplies by 20 trips twice, which double-counts the trips and creates an unrealistic number. Think about it logically - 20,000 bags would mean delivering to nearly every household in a small city. This is impossible for one person doing neighborhood deliveries. The correct answer of 1000 bags represents a more reasonable workload of 200 deliveries per day.",
