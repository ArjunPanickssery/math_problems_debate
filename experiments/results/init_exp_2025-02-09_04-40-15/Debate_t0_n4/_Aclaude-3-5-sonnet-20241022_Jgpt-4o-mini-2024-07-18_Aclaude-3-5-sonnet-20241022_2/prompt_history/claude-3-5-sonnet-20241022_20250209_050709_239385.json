Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

We have 30 red balls, 36 green balls (30 + 6), and the extra 6 balls that were used to establish the difference between red and green. These 6 reference balls are physical objects that must be counted in the total. Just like if I say \"I have 2 more apples than oranges, with 3 oranges,\" I need to count both the oranges (3), and the additional apples (5), and the 2 extra apples used for comparison. Therefore, the total is 30 + 36 + 6 = 72 balls.",
