Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many more pairs of shoes does Anthony have compared to Jim?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2.0\nAnthony:7(3)=21\nJim:21-2=19\nAnthony has 21-19=2 more pairs of shoes.\n#### 2\n(B): 6.0\nAnthony:7(3)=21\nJim:5(3)=15\nAnthony has 21-15=6 more pairs of shoes.\n#### 6</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe calculation shows that Scott has 7 pairs, and Anthony has triple that amount, which is 21 pairs. To find Jim's shoes, we simply subtract 2 from Anthony's amount, as stated in the question \"Jim has 2 less pairs than Anthony.\" This gives us 19 pairs for Jim. The question asks for the difference between Anthony and Jim's shoes, which is 21 - 19 = 2 pairs. Answer B incorrectly assumes Jim's shoes should be calculated using Scott's number, which contradicts the problem statement that explicitly relates Jim's shoes to Anthony's count, not Scott's.\n\n</transcript>"
