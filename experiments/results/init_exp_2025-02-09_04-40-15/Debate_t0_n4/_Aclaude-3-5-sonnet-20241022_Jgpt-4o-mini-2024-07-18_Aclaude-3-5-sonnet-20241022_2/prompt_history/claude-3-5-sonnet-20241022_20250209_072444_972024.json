Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If Mr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars, how many silver dollars the three have in total?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 205.0\nMr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars.\nIf Mr. Phung has 16 more silver dollars than Mr. Chiu, then his total silver dollars is 56+16 = 72\nThe total number of silver dollars that Mr. Ha owns is 72 +5= 77\nCombined, together they have 77+72+56 = 205 silver dollars\n#### 205\n(B): 189.0\nMr. Chiu has 56 silver dollars.\nMr. Phung has 16 more silver dollars than Mr. Chiu, so he has 56+16 = 72 silver dollars\nMr. Ha has 5 more silver dollars, so his total is 56+5 = 61 silver dollars\nTogether they have 72+61+56 = 189 silver dollars\n#### 189</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe key to this problem lies in understanding the relationships between the three people's silver dollar counts. The question states that Mr. Ha owns 5 more than Mr. Phung, not 5 more than Mr. Chiu. Therefore, Mr. Ha's total should be calculated as Mr. Phung's amount (72) plus 5, which equals 77. This would lead to an incorrect total of 205. The correct calculation should be Mr. Chiu's 56 plus Mr. Phung's 72 plus Mr. Ha's 61 (which is Mr. Chiu's 56 plus 5), totaling 189 silver dollars. The wording clearly indicates that each comparison is relative to the previously mentioned person, not to Mr. Chiu.\n\n</transcript>"
