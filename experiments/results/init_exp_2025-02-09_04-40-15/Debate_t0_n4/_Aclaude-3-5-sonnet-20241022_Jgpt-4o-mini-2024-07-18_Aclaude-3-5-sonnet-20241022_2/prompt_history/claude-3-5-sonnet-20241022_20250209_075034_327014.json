Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

      "content": "<question>QUESTION: Haley has 5 more necklaces than Jason. Josh has half the number of necklaces as Jason. If Haley has 25 necklaces, how many more necklaces does Haley have than Josh?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 15.0\nJason has 25-5 = 20 necklaces.\nJosh has 20/2 = 10 necklaces.\nHaley has 25-10 = 15 more necklaces than Josh.\n#### 15\n(A): 10.0\nHaley has 25 necklaces\nJason must have 25+5 = 30 necklaces\nJosh has half of Jason's, so 30/2 = 15 necklaces\nThe difference between Haley and Josh is 25-15 = 10 necklaces\n#### 10</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe key is to carefully follow the relationships given in the problem. When it states \"Haley has 5 more necklaces than Jason,\" this means we must add 5 to Jason's count to get Haley's count. Since Haley has 25 necklaces, Jason must have 30 necklaces (25 + 5). Josh has half of Jason's necklaces, so he has 15 necklaces (30 \u00f7 2). Therefore, the difference between Haley's 25 necklaces and Josh's 15 necklaces is 10 necklaces. The other solution incorrectly subtracts 5 from Haley's count to find Jason's necklaces, which reverses the given relationship.\n\n</transcript>"
