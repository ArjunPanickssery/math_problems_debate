Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

      "content": "<question>QUESTION: Carol sells tickets for an exhibition. During three days she sold tickets worth $960. One ticket costs $4. How many tickets on average did she sell during one of these three days?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 80.0\nCarol sold 960 / 4 = 240 tickets during three days.\nSo in one day, she sold on average 240 / 3 = 80 tickets.\n#### 80\n(A): 1280\nFirst divide the total money by days to get daily revenue\n$960 / 3 = $320 per day\nThen since each ticket is $4, that means she sold 320 \u00d7 4 = 1280 tickets per day\n#### 1280</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe calculation must consider daily revenue first, then convert to tickets, not the other way around. When dealing with averages involving money and units, we should maintain consistency by working with dollar amounts until the final step. By dividing $960 by 3 days, we get $320 per day. Since each ticket is $4, we multiply $320 by 4 (because $4 goes into $320 exactly 80 times), giving us 1,280 tickets per day. This approach maintains proper dimensional analysis and follows standard business accounting practices where daily revenue is calculated before unit sales.\n\n</transcript>"
