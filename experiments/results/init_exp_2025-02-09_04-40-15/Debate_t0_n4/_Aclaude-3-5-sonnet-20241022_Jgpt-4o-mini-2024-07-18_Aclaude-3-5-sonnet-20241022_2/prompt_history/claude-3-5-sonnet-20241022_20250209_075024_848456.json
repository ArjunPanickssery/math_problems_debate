Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The question states there are \"6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons.\" This means we need to first double the blue crayons (19 \u00d7 2 = 38) and then ADD 6 to get the number of yellow crayons. Think of it this way: if something is \"less than\" a number, and we want to find the original number, we need to add. For example, if 7 is 3 less than 10, then 10 is the original number. Therefore, the correct calculation is 38 + 6 = 44 yellow crayons.\n\n</transcript>"
