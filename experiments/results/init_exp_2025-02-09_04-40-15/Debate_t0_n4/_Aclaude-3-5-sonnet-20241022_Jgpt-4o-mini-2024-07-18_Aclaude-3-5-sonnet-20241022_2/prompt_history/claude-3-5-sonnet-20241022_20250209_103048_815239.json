Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many yellow crayons are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 32.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:5+14=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)-6=32 crayons\n#### 32\n(A): 44.0\nRed:14 crayons\nBlue:14+5=19 crayons\nYellow:19(2)+6=44 crayons\n#### 44</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe key to this problem lies in understanding the phrase \"6 less yellow crayons than double the blue crayons.\" This means we need to take double the blue crayons and subtract 6. We have 19 blue crayons (14 + 5), so double that is 38. Then, we subtract 6 to get 32 yellow crayons. The opposing solution incorrectly adds 6 instead of subtracting it, which goes against the problem's wording of \"6 less.\" The phrase \"less than\" always indicates subtraction, making 32 the correct answer.\n\n</transcript>"
