Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The question clearly states that two CDs are 1.5 hours each, meaning their combined length is 3 hours (1.5 \u00d7 2). The third CD is twice as long as one of these CDs, so it's 3 hours (1.5 \u00d7 2). Therefore, the total length must be 6 hours (3 hours from the two shorter CDs plus 3 hours from the longer CD). This interpretation aligns perfectly with how we naturally calculate combined durations, and the arithmetic is straightforward. The wording \"Two of them are 1.5 hours each\" specifically indicates that each CD is 1.5 hours, not that their combined length is 1.5 hours.",
