Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100\n(B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe ratio 2:1:3 means that Sandra gets 2 parts, Amy gets 1 part, and Ruth gets 3 parts. Since we know Amy's share is $50, and this represents 1 part, we can determine that each \"part\" is worth $50. Therefore, Sandra, who gets 2 parts, must receive 2 \u00d7 $50 = $100. This follows the fundamental principle of ratios where if we know the value of one part, we multiply it by the number of parts assigned to find other values. The calculation $50/2 would incorrectly divide Amy's share, when we actually need to multiply it by Sandra's ratio component.\n\n</transcript>"
