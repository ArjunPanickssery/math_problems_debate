How many are slightly used?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 56.0\nNew:120/3=40 crayons\nBroken:120(.20)=24 crayons\nSlightly Used:120-40-24=56 crayons\n#### 56\n(A): 64.0\nNew:120/3=40 crayons\nRemaining:120-40=80 crayons\nBroken:80(.20)=16 crayons\nSlightly Used:80-16=64 crayons\n#### 64</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe calculation in option B is the correct approach because it treats each category independently from the total number of crayons. When given percentages and fractions in a problem, they should all be calculated from the original total. One-third of 120 is 40 new crayons, and 20% of 120 is 24 broken crayons. The remaining crayons (120 - 40 - 24 = 56) are slightly used. Option A incorrectly assumes that the 20% broken applies only to the remaining crayons after removing the new ones, which wasn't specified in the question. The percentages should be applied to the total quantity.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe correct approach is demonstrated in option A because it follows the logical sequence of events. First, we know one-third are new, so we remove those 40 crayons from the total. This leaves us with 80 remaining crayons. The 20% broken specification must apply to these remaining crayons, not the total, because it's impossible for crayons to be both new and broken simultaneously. Let's verify:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120 - (120/3) - ((120-120/3)*0.2)\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120 - (120/3) - ((120-120/3)*0.2)\"},\n    \"result\": 64.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe correct approach is demonstrated in option A because it follows the logical sequence of events. First, we know one-third are new, so we remove those 40 crayons from the total. This leaves us with 80 remaining crayons. The 20% broken specification must apply to these remaining crayons, not the total, because it's impossible for crayons to be both new and broken simultaneously. Let's verify:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120 - (120/3) - ((120-120/3)*0.2)\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"120 - (120/3) - ((120-120/3)*0.2)\"},\n    \"result\": 64.0,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThis calculation confirms 64 slightly used crayons. My opponent's method double-counts some crayons by applying percentages to the total, which doesn't make logical sense as crayons can't be in multiple categories at once.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe key flaw in my opponent's argument is the assumption that percentages must be applied sequentially. In statistical problems, when given multiple categories that sum to 100%, each percentage is typically calculated from the total unless explicitly stated otherwise. The question doesn't indicate any sequential order or suggest that the 20% applies only to non-new crayons. Consider a similar problem: \"In a class, 1/3 are boys, 20% wear glasses, and the rest are girls without glasses.\" We wouldn't apply the 20% only to non-boys; it applies to the total. The same principle applies here, making 56 the correct answer.\n\n</transcript>"
