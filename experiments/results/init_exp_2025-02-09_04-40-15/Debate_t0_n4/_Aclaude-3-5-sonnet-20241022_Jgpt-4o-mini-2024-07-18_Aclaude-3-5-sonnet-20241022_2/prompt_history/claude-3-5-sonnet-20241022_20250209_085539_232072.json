Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If she has $51 left, how much money, in dollars, did she have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 204.0\nAfter buying the toy, Isabel has 51*2=102 dollars left.\nIsabel had 102*2=204 dollars at first.\n#### 204\n(A): 408.0\nWorking backwards from what's left:\n51 * 2 = 102 is the previous amount\n102 * 2 = 204 is the amount before that\n204 * 2 = 408 was the initial amount\n#### 408</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe solution is clearly 204 dollars. Let's work through this step by step. When Isabel spent \"half the amount\" initially, she went from 204 to 102 dollars. Then, when she spent \"half of the remaining money,\" she went from 102 to 51 dollars. This perfectly matches the information given. The key is understanding that \"half of the remaining money\" refers to half of what was left after the first purchase, not half of the original amount. If we started with 408 dollars, after spending half she would have 204, and then spending half again would leave her with 102, not 51. Therefore, 204 must be the correct initial amount.\n\n</transcript>"
