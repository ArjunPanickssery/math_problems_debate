Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The correct way to calculate a percentage discount is to divide the amount saved by the original price. In this case, Asia saved $210 ($350 - $140), and the original price was $350. Therefore, the calculation should be $210/$350 = 0.60, or 60%. This makes logical sense because if something is 100% off, it's free, and if it's more than 100% off, the store would be paying you to take it. Since Asia still paid $140 for the dress, a 150% discount is mathematically impossible. The 60% discount represents the actual portion of the original price that was reduced.",
