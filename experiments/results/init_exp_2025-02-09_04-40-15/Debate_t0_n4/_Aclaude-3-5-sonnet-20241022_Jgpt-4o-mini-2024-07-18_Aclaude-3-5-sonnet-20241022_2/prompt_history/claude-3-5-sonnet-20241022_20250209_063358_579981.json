Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

      "content": "<question>QUESTION: Bush and Matt are brothers. Bush is younger than Matt by 3 years. This year Bush will be 12 years old. What will be Matt's age 10 years from now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 25.0\nBush is younger than Matt by 3 years, so if Bush is 12 years old then Matt is 12+3 = 15 years old\nIn 10 years' time, Matt will be 10+15 = 25 years old\n#### 25\n(B): 28.0\nBush is 12, Matt is 3 years older, so Matt is 12+3 = 15\nSince Matt will always be 3 years older, we add 3 again: 15+3 = 18\nIn 10 years' time, Matt will be 18+10 = 28\n#### 28</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe solution is straightforward and follows basic arithmetic. If Bush is 12 years old, and Matt is 3 years older, then Matt is currently 15 years old (12 + 3 = 15). To find Matt's age in 10 years, we simply add 10 to his current age: 15 + 10 = 25. The key error in the opposing argument is adding 3 twice - we only need to account for the age difference once to establish Matt's current age. Adding 3 again is double-counting the age difference, which leads to an incorrect result of 28. The age gap remains constant at 3 years throughout their lives, so we don't need to add it multiple times.\n\n</transcript>"
