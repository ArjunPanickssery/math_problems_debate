Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

      "content": "<question>QUESTION: Sam shared a sum of money between his three cousins Sandra, Amy and Ruth in the ratio 2:1:3 respectively. If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100\n(B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe ratio 2:1:3 represents proportional parts of the total sum, where Sandra gets 2 parts, Amy gets 1 part, and Ruth gets 3 parts. When we say Sandra gets \"2 parts,\" this means we need to divide Amy's amount by 2 to find the value of one part, since Amy's portion represents 1 part. If Amy received $50, then one part equals $50/2 = $25. Therefore, Sandra's 2 parts would be worth $25 each, totaling $25. This interpretation correctly follows the mathematical principle of using ratios to determine proportional shares of a whole.\n\n</transcript>"
