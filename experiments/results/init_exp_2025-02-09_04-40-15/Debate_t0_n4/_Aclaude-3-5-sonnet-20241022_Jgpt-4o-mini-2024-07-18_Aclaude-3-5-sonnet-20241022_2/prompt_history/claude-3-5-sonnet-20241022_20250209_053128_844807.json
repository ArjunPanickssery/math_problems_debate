Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The question asks for the total number of bags John ate. When it states he \"eats twice as many after dinner,\" this means the total is doubled, not that he ate two additional bags. If he ate 1 bag for dinner, and then twice as many means doubling the total, that's 1 \u00d7 2 = 2 bags total. This interpretation aligns with common language usage where \"twice as many\" typically refers to the total amount being doubled, not adding double the original amount. Think of similar phrases like \"twice as expensive\" - it means the total price is doubled, not the original price plus double.",
