Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If Garret is currently 12, how old is Shane now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 44.0\nTwenty years ago, Shane was 12 * 2 = 24 years old\nShane is currently 24 + 20 = 44 years old\n#### 44\n(A): 64.0\nFirst, we know Shane was 2 times Garret's current age of 12\nSo Shane was 12 * 2 = 24\nThen we need to account for the twenty year difference twice\nAdding 20 years for Shane and 20 years for the time difference\nSo Shane is currently 24 + 40 = 64 years old\n#### 64</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe question states that twenty years ago, Shane was 2 times older than Garret is now. Since Garret is currently 12, Shane was 24 years old twenty years ago (12 \u00d7 2 = 24). To find Shane's current age, we simply need to add the 20-year time difference once, making Shane 44 years old now (24 + 20 = 44). Adding the time difference twice would be incorrect because we're only moving forward in time once. The statement \"twenty years ago\" only requires one adjustment of 20 years, not two. Think of it like a timeline - we're just moving from one point (24 years old) forward by 20 years to reach Shane's current age of 44.\n\n</transcript>"
