Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The answer is clearly $45. When a discount is given, it reduces the original price. The question states Sheryll was \"given a discount of $0.5 each,\" meaning the price was lowered by 50 cents per book. The original price of $5 minus the 50-cent discount equals $4.50 per book. With 10 books purchased at $4.50 each, the total cost is $45. This aligns with common retail practices where discounts decrease the amount customers pay, not increase it. Let me calculate this: $5 - $0.5 = $4.5, then $4.5 \u00d7 10 = $45.",
