Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The key to this problem lies in understanding the relative relationships between the three people's silver dollar counts. When it states \"Mr. Ha owns 5 more silver dollars than Mr. Phung,\" this means we must add 5 to Mr. Phung's total of 72 silver dollars to get Mr. Ha's amount (77). The problem establishes a clear chain: Mr. Ha has 5 more than Mr. Phung, who has 16 more than Mr. Chiu. Therefore, we must first calculate Mr. Phung's total (72) and then add 5 to get Mr. Ha's amount (77). Adding all three totals (77 + 72 + 56) gives us 205 silver dollars, which is the correct total.",
