Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The calculation in answer A is the correct approach because it properly accounts for both Henry AND his brother eating one apple each day. With 42 total apples and two people consuming them daily, they will go through 14 apples per week (7 days \u00d7 2 people). Therefore, the 42 apples will last exactly 3 weeks (42 \u00f7 14 = 3). Answer B incorrectly assumes only one apple is being consumed per day, when in fact two apples are being eaten daily. This makes B's calculation of 6 weeks mathematically impossible, as the apples would run out in half that time due to double the consumption rate.",
