Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

      "content": "<question>QUESTION: Lyra bought a pair of shoes at a 20% discount.  If she paid $480, how much was the original price of the pair of shoes?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 600.0\nLyra only paid $480 for the pair of shoes which is only 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.\nSo let x be the original price.\nThen 0.8x = $480\nThus x = $480 / 0.8 = $600\n#### 600\n(A): 576\nThe discount amount is 20% of $480 = $96\nThe original price is $480 + $96 = $576\n#### 576</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe calculation must be based on the discounted price of $480, not the original price. When calculating a discount, we take the percentage of the original price, not the final price. In this case, $480 is what Lyra paid after the discount, so we add back 20% of $480 ($96) to get the original price of $576. If we were to use method B, we'd be calculating 20% of the original price ($600), which would give us a discount of $120, resulting in a final price of $480 - $120 = $360, which doesn't match what Lyra actually paid.\n\n</transcript>"
