Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "I'll argue in favor of answer A (205 silver dollars):\n\nMy calculation follows a clear, step-by-step logical progression. Mr. Chiu starts with 56 silver dollars. Mr. Phung has 16 more than Mr. Chiu, which means he has 72 silver dollars. Mr. Ha owns 5 more silver dollars than Mr. Phung, so he has 77 silver dollars. When we add these together (56 + 72 + 77), we get exactly 205 silver dollars. The problem statement provides precise relationships between the amounts, and my calculation methodically follows those relationships to arrive at the total. Each step is mathematically sound and directly derived from the original information.",
