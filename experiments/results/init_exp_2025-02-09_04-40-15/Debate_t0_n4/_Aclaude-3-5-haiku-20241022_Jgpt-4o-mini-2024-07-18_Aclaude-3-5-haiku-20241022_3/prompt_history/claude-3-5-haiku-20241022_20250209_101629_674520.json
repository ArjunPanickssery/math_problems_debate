Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many bags of chips did he eat?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 3.0\nHe ate 2 * 1 = 2 bags after dinner\nSo he ate 2 + 1 = 3 bags of chips\n#### 3\n(A): 2.0\nHe ate 1 bag for dinner\nApply the doubling: 1 * 2 = 2 bags in total\n#### 2</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nJohn ate 1 bag of chips for dinner, which serves as the base quantity. When he eats \"twice as many after dinner\", this means he multiplies his initial amount by 2. So 1 * 2 = 2 bags total. The key is understanding that \"twice as many\" means doubling the original quantity, not adding an additional two bags. The problem statement clearly indicates he eats a bag for dinner, then doubles that amount, resulting in 2 bags total. The arithmetic is straightforward: 1 bag initially, multiplied by 2, equals 2 bags.\n\n</transcript>"
