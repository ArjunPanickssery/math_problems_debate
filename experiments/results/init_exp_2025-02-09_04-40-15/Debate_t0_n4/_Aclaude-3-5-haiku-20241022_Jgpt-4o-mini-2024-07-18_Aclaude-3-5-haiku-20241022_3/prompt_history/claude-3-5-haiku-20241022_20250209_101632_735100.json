Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

      "content": "<question>QUESTION: Sam shared a sum of money between his three cousins Sandra, Amy and Ruth in the ratio 2:1:3 respectively. If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100\n(B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe ratio 2:1:3 means that for every 1 part Amy receives, Sandra gets 2 parts. Since Amy received $50, which represents 1 part, Sandra's 2 parts will be calculated by multiplying Amy's amount by 2. This directly yields $100 for Sandra. \n\nThe key insight is understanding proportional division: if Amy's single part is $50, then Sandra's two parts must be $50 * 2 = $100. This follows the fundamental principle of ratio distribution, where each part's value is determined by the original amount and the relative proportion assigned in the ratio. The mathematical logic clearly supports $100 as Sandra's share.\n\n</transcript>"
