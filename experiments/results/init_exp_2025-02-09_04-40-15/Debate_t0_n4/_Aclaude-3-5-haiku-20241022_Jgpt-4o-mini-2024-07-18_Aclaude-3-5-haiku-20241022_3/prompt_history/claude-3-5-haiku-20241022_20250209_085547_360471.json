Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The problem states Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu, which means Albert has 4 * 9 = 36 books. However, the calculation of total books is flawed. \n\nThe correct approach is to recognize that Albert's book count is derived from Stu's, but not by simply adding 4 to Stu's total. Albert has 4 times Stu's books, which means 4 * 9 = 36 books. When we add Stu's 9 books to Albert's 36 books, we get a total of 45 books.\n\nThis matches option A's final calculation of 45 total books. The reasoning in option A is sound, making 45 the correct answer.\n\n</transcript>"
