Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "The problem states that Wyatt has 10 blue envelopes and 4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue envelopes. This means the number of yellow envelopes is 10 - 4 = 6 yellow envelopes. By simple addition, the total number of envelopes is 10 blue + 6 yellow = 16 envelopes. The calculation is straightforward and follows directly from the problem statement. The key is to carefully read \"4 fewer\" as subtraction, not addition. Answer B correctly interprets the problem's wording and provides the precise count of envelopes Wyatt possesses.",
