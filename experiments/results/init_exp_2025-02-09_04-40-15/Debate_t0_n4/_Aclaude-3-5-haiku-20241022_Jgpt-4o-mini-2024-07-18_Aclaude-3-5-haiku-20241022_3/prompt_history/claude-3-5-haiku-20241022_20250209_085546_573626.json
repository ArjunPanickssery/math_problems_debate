Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

In Answer B, the algebraic setup correctly represents this relationship as 9x+5, where x is the number of roosters. The total chicken count equation 9x+5+x=75 balances perfectly, solving to x=7 roosters and 9(7)+5=68 hens. \n\nAnswer A incorrectly uses 9x-5, which contradicts the problem's wording. The negative sign fundamentally misinterprets the relationship between roosters and hens. By using 9x+5, we maintain the precise mathematical relationship described in the original problem statement, leading to the correct solution of 68 hens.\n\n</transcript>"
