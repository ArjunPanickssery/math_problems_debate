Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

      "content": "<question>QUESTION: June made a design with 20 equal tiles. Three tiles are yellow and the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles. Six tiles are purple and the remaining tiles are white.  How many white tiles are there?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 7.0\nThere are 3 + 1 = 4 blue tiles.\nThere are a total of 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 tiles are yellow, blue, and purple.\nHence, 20 - 13 = 7 tiles are white.\n#### 7\n(B): 10.0\nThe yellow and blue tiles together total 3 + 1 = 4 tiles.\nAdding the purple tiles gives us 4 + 6 = 10 colored tiles.\nTherefore, 20 - 10 = 10 tiles must be white.\n#### 10</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nMy argument for Answer A (7 white tiles):\n\nThe problem clearly states June's design uses 20 total tiles. Let's methodically count the colored tiles: 3 yellow tiles, 4 blue tiles (one more than yellow), and 6 purple tiles. These colored tiles total 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 tiles. By simple subtraction, the remaining white tiles must be 20 - 13 = 7 tiles. The arithmetic is straightforward and matches the problem's constraints. Each step follows logically from the given information, and the final count of white tiles is precisely 7.\n\n</transcript>"
