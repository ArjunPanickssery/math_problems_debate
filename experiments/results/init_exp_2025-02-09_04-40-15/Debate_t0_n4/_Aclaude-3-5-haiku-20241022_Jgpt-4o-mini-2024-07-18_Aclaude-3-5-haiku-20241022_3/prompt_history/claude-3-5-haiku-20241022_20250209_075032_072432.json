Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

      "content": "<question>QUESTION: Sam shared a sum of money between his three cousins Sandra, Amy and Ruth in the ratio 2:1:3 respectively. If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 100.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100\n#### 100\n(B): 25.0\nGoing by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra's 2 parts means we take Amy's amount and adjust it by 2\nSince Amy got $50, Sandra will get $50/2 = $25\n#### 25</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nThe key to solving this problem lies in understanding the ratio distribution. The ratio 2:1:3 means that for every 1 part Amy receives, Sandra gets 2 parts and Ruth gets 3 parts. When Amy receives $50, we need to determine Sandra's share relative to Amy's.\n\nTo calculate Sandra's amount, we divide Amy's $50 by her ratio part (1) and multiply by Sandra's ratio part (2). This gives us: $50 * (2/1) = $25. \n\nThe ratio tells us that Sandra's portion is twice Amy's, but this doesn't mean multiplying Amy's amount by 2. Instead, it means scaling Amy's amount proportionally based on the ratio parts. Therefore, Sandra receives $25, making option B the correct answer.\n\n</transcript>"
