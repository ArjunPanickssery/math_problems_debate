Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many are slightly used?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 56.0\nNew:120/3=40 crayons\nBroken:120(.20)=24 crayons\nSlightly Used:120-40-24=56 crayons\n#### 56\n(A): 64.0\nNew:120/3=40 crayons\nRemaining:120-40=80 crayons\nBroken:80(.20)=16 crayons\nSlightly Used:80-16=64 crayons\n#### 64</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nThe key to solving this problem lies in understanding the order of operations and percentages. In answer A, we first remove the new crayons (1/3 of 120 = 40), leaving 80 crayons. Then we calculate 20% of these 80 remaining crayons as broken, which is 16 crayons. This leaves 64 crayons as slightly used.\n\nIn contrast, answer B incorrectly calculates the broken crayons directly from the total 120, which skews the calculation. By first removing the new crayons and then calculating the broken percentage from the remaining crayons, answer A provides a more precise and logically sound approach to determining the number of slightly used crayons.\n\n</transcript>"
