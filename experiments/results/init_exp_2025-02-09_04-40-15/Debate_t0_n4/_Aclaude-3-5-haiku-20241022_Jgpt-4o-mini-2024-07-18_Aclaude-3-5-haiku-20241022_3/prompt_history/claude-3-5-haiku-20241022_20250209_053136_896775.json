Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

          "content": "My argument for answer B (13 lives):\n\nThe problem clearly states that a cat has nine lives, and a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. This means the dog has 6 lives (9 - 3 = 6). The mouse then has 7 more lives than the dog, which calculates to 13 lives (6 + 7 = 13). The arithmetic is straightforward and follows the logical sequence given in the problem statement. Each step builds systematically: we start with the cat's 9 lives, reduce to the dog's 6 lives, and then add 7 to reach the mouse's 13 lives. The calculation is precise and matches the original problem's relational descriptions.",
