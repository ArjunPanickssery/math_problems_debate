      "content": "<question>QUESTION: Bush and Matt are brothers. Bush is younger than Matt by 3 years. This year Bush will be 12 years old. What will be Matt's age 10 years from now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 25.0\nBush is younger than Matt by 3 years, so if Bush is 12 years old then Matt is 12+3 = 15 years old\nIn 10 years' time, Matt will be 10+15 = 25 years old\n#### 25\n(B): 28.0\nBush is 12, Matt is 3 years older, so Matt is 12+3 = 15\nSince Matt will always be 3 years older, we add 3 again: 15+3 = 18\nIn 10 years' time, Matt will be 18+10 = 28\n#### 28</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nI will argue for Answer A (25.0):\n\nThe solution is straightforward. Bush is currently 12 years old, and Matt is 3 years older, which means Matt is currently 15 years old. When we look 10 years into the future, we simply add 10 to Matt's current age: 15 + 10 = 25. This directly follows from the given information that Bush is 12 this year and Matt is 3 years older. The calculation is simple arithmetic, showing Matt will be 25 years old in 10 years. The problem provides clear, unambiguous information that allows us to calculate Matt's future age precisely.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nI'll argue for Answer B (28.0):\n\nLet's carefully analyze the age progression. Bush is currently 12, and Matt is 3 years older, making Matt 15 now. However, the key insight is that the age difference remains constant. <tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"15 + 10\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"15 + 10\"},\n    \"result\": 25,\n}\n</tool_result>\nI'll argue for Answer B (28.0):\n\nLet's carefully analyze the age progression. Bush is currently 12, and Matt is 3 years older, making Matt 15 now. However, the key insight is that the age difference remains constant. <tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"15 + 10\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"15 + 10\"},\n    \"result\": 25,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe previous argument stops at 25, but that's incorrect. We must add the original 3-year age difference again. So Matt will be 25 + 3 = 28 years old in 10 years. The persistent 3-year gap between their ages means Matt will always be 3 years older than Bush, regardless of time passage.\n\n</transcript>"

Matt is currently 15 years old (12 + 3), and when we project 10 years into the future, we simply add 10 to his current age: 15 + 10 = 25. The problem statement clearly provides Matt's current age relative to Bush, and the calculation is a straightforward arithmetic progression. There's no need to complicate the problem by adding an additional 3 years. The age difference remains constant, but that doesn't mean we add it again when calculating future age. The most precise and simple interpretation leads to 25 years old.\n\nThe opponent's argument introduces an unnecessary complication by suggesting we add the original age difference again. This would create an arbitrary and illogical age increment that isn't supported by the original problem statement.",
