Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

In the previous argument, the interpretation was incorrect. Let's solve systematically:\n\nLet x represent the number of roosters. The number of hens is 9x+5, not 9x-5. When we set up the equation:\n\nTotal chickens = Roosters + Hens\n75 = x + (9x+5)\n75 = 10x + 5\n70 = 10x\nx = 7 roosters\n\nNumber of hens: 9(7) + 5 = 63 + 5 = 68\n\nThis solution satisfies both conditions: 7 roosters + 68 hens = 75 total chickens, and the hens are 5 more than 9 times the roosters.
