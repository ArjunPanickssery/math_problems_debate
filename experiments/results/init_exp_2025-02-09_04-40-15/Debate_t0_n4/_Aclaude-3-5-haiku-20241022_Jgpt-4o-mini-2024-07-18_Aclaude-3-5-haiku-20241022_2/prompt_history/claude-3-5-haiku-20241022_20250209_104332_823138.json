Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

They also got 2 sodas for $1.00 each. The tax came to $3.

Answer B correctly calculates the food cost as $11 (chicken wings $6 + chicken salad $4 + 2 sodas $1 each), then adds $3 tax to reach $14 total spent. This leaves $4 in change, which matches the calculation in answer B.\n\n</transcript>"

The problem clearly states the chicken wings cost $6 and the chicken salad $4, plus two sodas at $1 each, which totals $12. Adding the $3 tax brings the total to $15. This leaves $3 in change, precisely matching answer A. The previous argument mistakenly reduced the food cost, leading to an incorrect change calculation.",
