Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many bags of chips did he eat?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 3.0\nHe ate 2 * 1 = 2 bags after dinner\nSo he ate 2 + 1 = 3 bags of chips\n#### 3\n(A): 2.0\nHe ate 1 bag for dinner\nApply the doubling: 1 * 2 = 2 bags in total\n#### 2</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nI'll argue for Answer A (2.0 bags of chips):\n\nJohn ate 1 bag of chips for dinner, and the problem states he eats \"twice as many after dinner\". This means he doubles his initial amount. Let me verify the calculation:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"1 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"1 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 2,\n}\n</tool_result>\nI'll argue for Answer A (2.0 bags of chips):\n\nJohn ate 1 bag of chips for dinner, and the problem states he eats \"twice as many after dinner\". This means he doubles his initial amount. Let me verify the calculation:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"1 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"1 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 2,\n}\n</tool_result>\nThe key is understanding \"twice as many\" means multiplying the original amount by 2, not adding 2. So 1 bag becomes 2 bags total. The wording \"twice as many\" directly implies multiplication, not addition. Therefore, John ate 2 bags of chips in total.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nI'll argue for Answer B (3.0 bags of chips):\n\nThe problem clearly states John eats a bag of chips for dinner and then eats twice as many after dinner. This means he first eats 1 bag, and then adds 2 more bags. Let's break it down:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"1 + (1 * 2)\"}\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>3</tool_result>\n\nThe key interpretation is \"twice as many\" means an additional 2 bags on top of the original bag. So he starts with 1 bag at dinner, then adds 2 more bags after dinner, totaling 3 bags. The phrase \"twice as many\" can be interpreted as an additional multiplication of the original amount, not just a simple doubling. This reading leads to a total of 3 bags of chips.\n\n</transcript>"
