Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many strings does he need?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 72.0\nThe basses take 3*4=12 strings\nHe restrings 2*3=6 normal guitars\nThat takes 6*6=36 strings\nHe restrings 6-3=3 guitars with 8 strings\nSo that uses 3*8=24 strings\nSo he uses 12+36+24=72 strings\n#### 72\n(B): 96.0\nThe basses take 3*4=12 strings\nHe restrings 2*3=6 normal guitars\nThat takes 6*6=36 strings\nFor 8-string guitars, we need 6 guitars\nSo that uses 6*8=48 strings\nSo he uses 12+36+48=96 strings\n#### 96</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nI'll argue in favor of answer B (96 strings) using a clear, step-by-step reasoning approach.\n\nLet's break down the problem systematically. John needs to restring:\n- 3 basses with 4 strings each\n- Twice as many guitars with 6 strings each\n- 3 fewer 8-string guitars compared to normal guitars\n\nLet's calculate:\n1. Bass strings: 3 * 4 = 12 strings\n2. Normal guitars: 2 * 3 = 6 guitars, so 6 * 6 = 36 strings\n3. 8-string guitars: The key difference is in how many 8-string guitars. If normal guitars are 6, then 8-string guitars are 6 - 3 = 3 guitars<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"3 * 8\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"3 * 8\"},\n    \"result\": 24,\n}\n</tool_result>\nI'll argue in favor of answer B (96 strings) using a clear, step-by-step reasoning approach.\n\nLet's break down the problem systematically.
