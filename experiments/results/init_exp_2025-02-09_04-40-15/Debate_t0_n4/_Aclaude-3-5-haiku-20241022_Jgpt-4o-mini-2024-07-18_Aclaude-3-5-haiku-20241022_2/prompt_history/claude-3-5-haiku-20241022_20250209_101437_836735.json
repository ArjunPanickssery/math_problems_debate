Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If she has 90 green houses, how many of her houses are not yellow?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 160.0\nIf the number of green houses is three times the number of yellow houses, and there are 90 green houses, then there are 90/3 = 30 yellow houses.\nShe also has 40 fewer yellow houses than blue houses, meaning there are 30+40 = 70 blue houses.\nThe number of houses that are not yellow is 70 blue houses +90 green houses = 160\n#### 160\n(A): 200.0\nIf green houses are three times yellow houses, and there are 90 green houses, then there are 90/3 = 30 yellow houses.\nYellow houses are 40 fewer than red houses, so there are 70 red houses.\nTo find all non-yellow houses, we add green houses (90) and red houses (70).\nThen we need to add the difference of 40 between red and yellow to get all non-yellow houses: 90 + 70 + 40 = 200\n#### 200</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nI'll argue for answer A (200) with a clear and concise argument:\n\nLet's break down the house colors systematically. We know Isabella has 90 green houses, which means she has 30 yellow houses (since green is three times yellow). The problem states she has 40 fewer yellow houses than red houses, so red houses must be 70. <tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"90 + 70 + 40\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"90 + 70 + 40\"},\n    \"result\": 200,\n}\n</tool_result>\nI'll argue for answer A (200) with a clear and concise argument:\n\nLet's break down the house colors systematically. We know Isabella has 90 green houses, which means she has 30 yellow houses (since green is three times yellow). The problem states she has 40 fewer yellow houses than red houses, so red houses must be 70. <tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"90 + 70 + 40\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"90 + 70 + 40\"},\n    \"result\": 200,\n}\n</tool_result>\nBy adding green houses (90), red houses (70), and the 40-house difference, we get 200 total non-yellow houses. The key insight is including the 40-house difference, which the other solution misses. This ensures we capture all non-yellow houses accurately.\n\n## Argument in favour of B\nI'll argue for answer B (160) with a clear and concise argument:\n\nThe problem clearly states that Isabella has 90 green houses, which means she has 30 yellow houses. She has 40 fewer yellow houses than red houses, so red houses total 70. <tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"90 + 70\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"90 + 70\"},\n    \"result\": 160,\n}\n</tool_result>\n\nBy simply adding green houses (90) and red houses (70), we get 160 non-yellow houses. The previous argument incorrectly adds the 40-house difference, which would be double-counting. Our method directly calculates non-yellow houses without unnecessary complications.\n\nMoreover, the question specifically asks for houses that are not yellow, which are precisely the green and red houses. Adding the 40-house difference would introduce an erroneous calculation.\n\n</transcript>"
