Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

For blue shirts, half of 26 is exactly 13 shirts given away, leaving 13 blue shirts. For brown shirts, a third of 36 is exactly 12 shirts given away, leaving 24 brown shirts. <tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"13 + 24\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"13 + 24\"},\n    \"result\": 37,\n}\n</tool_result>\n\nThis calculation yields exactly 37 shirts left, which matches Answer B. The previous argument incorrectly rounds 26/3, but we should use integer division to ensure accuracy. The precise calculation shows 37 shirts remain, making Answer B the correct choice.",
