Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The key difference from answer A is how we calculate the number of packs. Answer A incorrectly divides 1800 by 50, while the correct approach is to divide 1800 by 3 to get the total pack cost.\n\n## Argument in favour of A\nI'll argue for answer A: $108.\n\nLet's carefully analyze the problem. Carl needs 1800 index cards total, with each pack containing 50 cards:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"1800 / 50\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>36</result>\n\nThis means he needs 36 packs of index cards. Each pack costs $3:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"36 * 3\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<result>108</result>\n\nThe total cost is $108. The previous argument incorrectly calculated the number of packs by dividing 1800 by 3, which doesn't make sense given the pack size of 50 cards. The correct approach is to first determine how many 50-card packs are needed to cover 1800 cards, which is 36 packs, then multiply by the pack price of $3.\n\n</transcript>"
