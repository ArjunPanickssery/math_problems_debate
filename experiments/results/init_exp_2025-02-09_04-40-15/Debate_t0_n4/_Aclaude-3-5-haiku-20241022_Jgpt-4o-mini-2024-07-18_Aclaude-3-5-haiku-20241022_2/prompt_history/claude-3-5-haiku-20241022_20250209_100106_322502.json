Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If a blue pen costs ten cents each and a red pen costs twice as much as the blue pen, how much money does Maci pay for the pens?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nMaci pays 10 * $0.10 = $1 for the blue pens.\nEach red pen costs 2*$0.10 = $0.20\nShe pays 15*$0.20 = $3.00 for the red pens.\nTo buy all the pens she needs, Maci pays $3+$1= $4\n#### 4\n(A): 3.0\nMaci pays 10 * $0.10 = $1.00 for the blue pens.\nThe red pens should cost twice as much, so that's $1.00 * 2 = $2.00\nTo buy all the pens she needs, Maci pays $2.00 + $1.00 = $3.00\n#### 3</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of A\nI will argue for Answer A (3.0) as the correct solution.

They used $0.20 per red pen, but the problem states red pens cost twice as much as blue pens. Since blue pens are 10 cents, red pens are 20 cents. This means 15 red pens cost $3.00, not $2.00. Therefore, the total is $4.00, making Answer B correct.",
