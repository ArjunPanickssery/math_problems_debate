Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

How many of his students got a final grade of B and above if he has 60 students in Grade 5?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 36.0\nSince 40% of his students got below B, 100% - 40% = 60% of Mr. Sanchez's students got B and above.\nThus, 60 x 60/100 = 36 students got B and above in their final grade.\n#### 36\n(B): 24.0\n40% of Mr. Sanchez's students are relevant to our calculation of B and above grades.\nTherefore, 60 \u00d7 40/100 = 24 students got B and above in their final grade.\n#### 24</question>\n<your_answer>B</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>A</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n\n</transcript>"
