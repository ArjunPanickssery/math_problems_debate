Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

If their grandmother has 50 dolls, how many dolls do they have altogether?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 258.0\nIf the grandmother has 50 dolls, Rene's sister, who has 2 more dolls than their grandmother, has 50+2 = 52 dolls.\nTogether, Rene's sister and the grandmother have 52+50 = 102 dolls.\nSince Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, she has 52*3 = 156 dolls.\nAltogether, they have 156+102 = 258 dolls.\n#### 258\n(B): 658.0\nStarting with grandmother's 50 dolls, we first multiply by 3 to get 150.\nAdding 2 gives us the sister's number of dolls: 152.\nSince Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister, she has 152*3 = 456 dolls.\nThe total number of dolls is therefore 50+152+456 = 658.\n#### 658</question>\n<your_answer>A</your_answer>\n<opponent_answer>B</opponent_answer>\n\nHere is the transcript so far:\n<transcript>\n## Argument in favour of B\nI will argue in favor of answer B (658 dolls).

In answer A, they multiply the sister's dolls by 3. In answer B, we recognize that Rene has three times her sister's dolls, which means 152 * 3 = 456 dolls. This leads to the total of 658 dolls, accounting for grandmother's 50, sister's 52, and Rene's 456.\n\n</transcript>"
