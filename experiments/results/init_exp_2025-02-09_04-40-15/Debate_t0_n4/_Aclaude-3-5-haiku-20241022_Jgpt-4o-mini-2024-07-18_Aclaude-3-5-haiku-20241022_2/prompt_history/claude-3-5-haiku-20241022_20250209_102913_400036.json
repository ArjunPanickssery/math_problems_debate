Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

When we divide 160 pints across 80 containers, each container contains 2 pints. <tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"160 / 80\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>2</result>\n\nGeraldo drinks 3.5 containers, so his total consumption is: <tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"3.5 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>7</result>\n\nThis precisely calculates to 7 pints.
