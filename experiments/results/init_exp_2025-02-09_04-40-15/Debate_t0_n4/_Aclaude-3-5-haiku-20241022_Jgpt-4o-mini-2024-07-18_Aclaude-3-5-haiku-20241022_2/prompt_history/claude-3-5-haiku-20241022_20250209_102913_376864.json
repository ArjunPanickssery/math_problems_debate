Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Together, they must total 100 students.\n\nx + 3x = 100\n4x = 100\nx = 25\n\nThis means there are 25 boys in the Biology class. The girls would be 3 * 25 = 75, which indeed totals 100 students.
