Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

My initial reasoning was incorrect. Sandra would indeed get $100, as her 2 parts are twice Amy's 1 part. When Amy gets $50, Sandra receives $50 \u00d7 2 = $100.\n\nI now strongly argue for answer A (100.0). The ratio clearly shows Sandra gets twice what Amy receives, so with Amy getting $50, Sandra must get $100.\n\n</transcript>"

When Amy gets $50, we can directly calculate Sandra's share by multiplying Amy's amount by 2.\n\n<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"50 * 2\"}\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>100.0</result>\n\nTherefore, Sandra receives $100.
