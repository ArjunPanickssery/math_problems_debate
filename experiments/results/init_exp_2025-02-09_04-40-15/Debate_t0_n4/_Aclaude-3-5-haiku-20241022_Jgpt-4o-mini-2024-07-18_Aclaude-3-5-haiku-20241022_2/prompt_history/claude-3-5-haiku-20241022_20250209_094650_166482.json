Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

First, she spends half on a toy, leaving 102 dollars\n2. Then, she spends half of the remaining money on a book, leaving 51 dollars\n\nLet's verify the math:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"204 / 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>204.0 / 2 = 102.0</result>\n\nAnd then:<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"102 / 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<result>102.0 / 2 = 51.0</result>\n\nThe previous argument for 408 is incorrect because it double-counts the halvings. 204 is the precise amount that perfectly matches the problem's conditions, resulting in exactly 51 dollars left at the end.",
