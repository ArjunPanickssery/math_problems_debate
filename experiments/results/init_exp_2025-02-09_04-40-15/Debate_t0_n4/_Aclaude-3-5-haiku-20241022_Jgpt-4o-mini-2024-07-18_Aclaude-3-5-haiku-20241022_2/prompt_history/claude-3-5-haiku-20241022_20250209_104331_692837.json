Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

This leads to the progression: 10 \u2192 30 \u2192 90 \u2192 270 \u2192 810. Therefore, in May, she will save $810, making answer A the correct choice.\n\n</transcript>"

The plain language clearly indicates doubling, which results in $160 in May. The step-by-step calculation matches the problem's explicit instructions, making B the correct answer.",
