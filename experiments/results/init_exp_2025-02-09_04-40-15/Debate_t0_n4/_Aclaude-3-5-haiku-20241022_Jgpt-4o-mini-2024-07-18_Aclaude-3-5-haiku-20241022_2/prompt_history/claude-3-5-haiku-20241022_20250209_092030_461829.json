Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

This means he has a total of 180 students. If he buys 2 packs of index cards for EACH student, the calculation becomes:\n\n<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"6 * 30 * 2\"},\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"6 * 30 * 2\"},\n    \"result\": 360,\n}\n</tool_result>\n\nThe phrase \"2 packs of index cards for all his students\" logically implies 2 packs per student, not per class.
