Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The key is to calculate the weekly difference and then multiply by weeks worked. At the new job, Jame earns $800 per week ($20 * 40 hours). At his old job, he earned $400 per week ($16 * 25 hours). The difference is $400 per week. Multiplying this by 52 weeks gives $20,800 in additional annual earnings. \n\nThis approach directly calculates the increase in earnings by comparing the weekly pay and then extending it to a full year. The method is straightforward and matches the problem's requirement of finding the additional money earned annually.",
