Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

The key is to first calculate the number of ticks by multiplying the number of burrs by six, then add the original number of burrs to get the total count.\n\nThe alternative solution incorrectly calculates the number of ticks by adding 6 to 12, which fundamentally misinterprets the problem statement about \"six times as many ticks as burrs\".",
