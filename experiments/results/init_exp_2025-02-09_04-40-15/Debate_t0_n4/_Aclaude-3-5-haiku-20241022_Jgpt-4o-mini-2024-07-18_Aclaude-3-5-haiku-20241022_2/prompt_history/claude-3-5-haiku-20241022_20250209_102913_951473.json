Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Mr. Curtis has 325 total chickens, with 28 roosters. This means he has 297 hens (325 - 28 = 297). The problem specifically states that 20 of these hens do not lay eggs. Therefore, the number of egg-laying hens is 297 - 20 = 277.<tool_call>\n{\n    \"name\": math_eval,\n    \"arguments\": {\"expr\": \"297 - 20\"}\n}\n</tool_call>\n<tool_result>277</result>\n\nThis straightforward calculation clearly demonstrates that 277 is the correct number of egg-laying hens. The total number of hens remains 297, but only 277 are productive in terms of egg-laying. Answer B precisely captures this mathematical reality.",
