Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

Let me explain why B (28.0) is still correct.\n\nThe problem states that Matt is always 3 years older than Bush. So when we project 10 years into the future, Matt's age will increase by 10, but his relative age difference with Bush remains constant. This means Matt will be 18 years old when Bush is 15, and 10 years later, Matt will be 28.",
