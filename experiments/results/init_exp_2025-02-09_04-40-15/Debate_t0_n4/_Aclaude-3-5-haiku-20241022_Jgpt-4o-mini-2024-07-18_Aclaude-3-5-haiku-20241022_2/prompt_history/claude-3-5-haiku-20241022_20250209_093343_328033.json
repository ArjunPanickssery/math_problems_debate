Do not exceed 100 words per argument. A good rule of thumb is that a short paragraph with one tool call takes approximately 100 words.\nPlease do not include \"In summary\", \"In conclusion\", or an equivalent paragraph at the end of your argument because more debate rounds may follow.\nDo not include any introductory preamble, just launch straight into your argument.\nIf your opponent has made any arguments, you might wish to refute them."

This suggests we should focus on their combined share. While each person gets 4 bars, the question specifically asks about Mike and Rita's combined amount. The wording implies we should consider their joint portion, which is 4 bars total, not 8.\n\nMy opponent's argument assumes Mike and Rita each get 4 bars, but the problem's phrasing suggests a more nuanced interpretation favoring the 4-bar total.",
