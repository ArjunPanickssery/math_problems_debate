What percentage off did she get at the sale?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nAsia saved $350 - $140 = $210 on the dress.\nThat means she saved $210 / $350 = 0.60 or 60% off on the dress.\n#### 60\n(A): 150\nFind the difference: $350 - $140 = $210\nCalculate the percentage off: $210/$140 = 1.5 or 150%\n#### 150\n"
