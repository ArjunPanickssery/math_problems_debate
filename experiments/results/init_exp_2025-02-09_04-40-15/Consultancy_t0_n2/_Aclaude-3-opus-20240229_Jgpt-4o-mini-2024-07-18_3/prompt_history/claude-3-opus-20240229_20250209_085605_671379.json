      "content": "QUESTION: Ali and Sara ate 80 small apples combined. Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara. How many apples did Sara eat?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 16.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: A = 4S\nWhich means: 4S + S = 80\nSo: 5S = 80\nSo the number of apples Sara ate is: S = 80 / 5= 16 apples\n#### 16\n(A): 64.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: S = 4A\nWhich means: A + 4A = 80\nSo: 5A = 80\nTherefore: A = 16\nAnd finally: S = 4A = 4 \u00d7 16 = 64 apples\n#### 64\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the relationship between the number of apples Ali and Sara ate? Can you confirm that Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 64.0\nLet A be the number of apples Ali ate and S be the number of apples Sara ate.\nWe have: A + S = 80 apples\nAnd: S = 4A\nWhich means: A + 4A = 80\nSo: 5A = 80\nTherefore: A = 16\nAnd finally: S = 4A = 4 \u00d7 16 = 64 apples\n#### 64"

      "content": "<thinking>\nThe key information needed to solve this problem is:\n1) The relationship between the number of apples Ali and Sara ate\n2) The total number of apples they ate combined\nThe question states that \"Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara\". This means if Sara ate S apples, then Ali ate 4S apples.\nIt also states they ate 80 apples combined. So Ali's apples plus Sara's apples equals 80.\nI have all the necessary information to set up equations and solve for the number of apples Sara ate.

Let me clarify the relationship between the number of apples Ali and Sara ate.\n\nThe question clearly states \"Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara.\" This means:\n* Let S be the number of apples Sara ate\n* Then Ali ate 4 times S, which is 4S\n\nSo the correct equations are:\n* Sara's apples = S\n* Ali's apples = 4S\n* Total apples = Ali's apples + Sara's apples\n* 80 = 4S + S\n* 80 = 5S\n\nSolving this:",
