How many packs did he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 360.0\nJohn has 6*30=180 students\nSo he bought 180*2=360 packs\n#### 360\n(A): 12.0\nCalculate number of classes: 6\nMultiply by 2 packs per class: 6*2=12\n#### 12\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many index cards are in each pack?  \nIs the number of students in each class relevant to the number of packs John bought?  \nDid John buy 2 packs in total or 2 packs for each class?  \nWhat is the total number of students John has across all classes?  \nHow many packs does John need to accommodate all students?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 12.0\nCalculate number of classes: 6\nMultiply by 2 packs per class: 6*2=12\n#### 12"
