Then we add 20 years to that age to get Shane's current age.\n\nNo tools are needed, as the question can be answered with the given information and basic arithmetic.\n</thinking>\n\nTwenty years ago, Shane was 2 times older than Garret is now. Since Garret is currently 12, that means twenty years ago, Shane was 2 * 12 = 24 years old.\n\nThe age difference between Shane and Garret is not explicitly stated, but we can calculate it. Since Shane was 24 twenty years ago, and Garret is 12 now, the age difference is 24 - 12 = 12 years. \n\nTo confirm, twenty years ago:\nShane's age = 2 * Garret's current age\n            = 2 * 12 \n            = 24\n\nOver the 20 year time period, both Shane and Garret aged by 20 years. So to get Shane's current age, we take his age from 20 years ago (24) and add 20:\n\nShane's current age = Shane's age 20 years ago + 20\n                    = 24 + 20\n                    = 44\n\nTherefore, Shane is currently 44 years old, which matches the answer provided in (B).",
