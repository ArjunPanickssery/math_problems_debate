How far does he move horizontally, in feet?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2700.0\nHe travels 1450-100=1350 feet vertically\nSo he travels 1350*2=2700 feet horizontally\n#### 2700\n(B): 2900.0\nHe reaches an elevation of 1450 feet\nSince he moves 2 feet horizontally for each vertical foot, he travels 1450*2=2900 feet horizontally\n#### 2900\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total vertical distance John climbs from 100 feet to 1450 feet? \n\nHow is the horizontal distance related to the vertical distance in this scenario? \n\nCan you confirm the ratio of horizontal distance to vertical distance that John travels? \n\nWhat would be the correct calculation for horizontal distance based on the vertical distance climbed? \n\nIs there a specific formula or method to determine the total horizontal distance from the vertical distance in this context?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 2900.0\nHe reaches an elevation of 1450 feet\nSince he moves 2 feet horizontally for each vertical foot, he travels 1450*2=2900 feet horizontally\n#### 2900"

          "content": "So the total vertical distance climbed is 1350 feet.\n\nThe problem states that John travels 2 feet horizontally for every 1 foot vertically. This means the ratio of horizontal distance to vertical distance is 2 to 1.\n\nTo calculate the total horizontal distance, we multiply the vertical distance by this ratio:\n\nHorizontal distance = 1350 feet * 2 = 2700 feet\n\nTherefore, the correct horizontal distance traveled is 2700 feet, not 2900 feet. The calculation in the provided answer multiplies the ending elevation of 1450 by 2, but it should be multiplying the total vertical distance climbed of 1350 by 2 instead.\n\nIn summary, to determine the horizontal distance from the vertical distance climbed, use this formula:\nHorizontal distance = Vertical distance * (Horizontal/Vertical ratio)",
