If three fourths of the jelly beans are red, and one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, how many jelly beans are coconut flavored?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 750.0\nThere are 4000/4*3=3000 red jelly beans.\nThere are 3000/4=750 coconut flavored jelly beans.\n#### 750\n(A): 1000.0\nFirst find one quarter of all jelly beans: 4000/4 = 1000\nSince these coconut ones must be among the red ones, and three fourths are red, \nthe coconut flavored ones are: 1000\n#### 1000\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many jelly beans are red?  \nWhat fraction of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored?  \nCan you confirm the total number of jelly beans in the jar?  \nIs there any information about the distribution of flavors among the jelly beans?  \nAre there any jelly beans that are not red?  \nWhat is the total number of coconut flavored jelly beans if we only consider the red ones?  \nHow did you arrive at the number of coconut flavored jelly beans?  \nIs there a possibility of misunderstanding the fractions given in the question?  \nCan you clarify how the fractions relate to the total number of jelly beans?  \nWhat assumptions are being made about the jelly bean flavors?  \n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 1000.0\nFirst find one quarter of all jelly beans: 4000/4 = 1000\nSince these coconut ones must be among the red ones, and three fourths are red, \nthe coconut flavored ones are: 1000\n#### 1000"

      "content": "<thinking>\nThe question provides the total number of jelly beans (4000) and the fraction that are red (3/4). It also states that 1/4 of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored. To determine the number of coconut flavored jelly beans, we first need to calculate the number of red jelly beans, then take 1/4 of that.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1. Calculate the number of red jelly beans (3/4 of 4000)\n2. Take 1/4 of the red jelly beans to get the number of coconut flavored ones\n\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful for doing these calculations. The \"expr\" parameter can be set to the mathematical expressions needed.\n\nFirst, to get the number of red jelly beans:\nexpr = \"4000 * 3/4\"\n\nThen, to take 1/4 of the red jelly beans:\nexpr = \"previous_result * 1/4\"\n\nWhere previous_result is the output from the first math_eval call.\n\nNo other tools seem necessary, as the question provides all the information needed. The order of the math_eval calls is important, as the second depends on the output of the first.\n</thinking>",
