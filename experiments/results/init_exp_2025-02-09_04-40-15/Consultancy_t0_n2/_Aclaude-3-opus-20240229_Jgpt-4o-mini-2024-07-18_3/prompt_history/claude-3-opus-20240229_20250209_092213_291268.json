          "content": "<thinking>\nTo calculate the total cost of Belle's treats for a week, we need to:\n1. Find the number of dog biscuits and rawhide bones Belle eats each evening\n2. Get the cost of one dog biscuit and one rawhide bone\n3. Calculate the number of days in a week\n4. Calculate the total cost of dog biscuits for a week based on the daily consumption and cost per biscuit\n5. Calculate the total cost of rawhide bones for a week based on the daily consumption and cost per bone\n6. Add the total costs for dog biscuits and rawhide bones to get the total weekly cost\n\nThe question provides all the necessary information, so no additional tools are needed. We can proceed with the calculations.\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the question, Belle eats 4 dog biscuits each evening. \nThe cost of one rawhide bone is $1, as stated in the question.\nSimilarly, the cost of one dog biscuit is $0.25.\nThere are 7 days in a week.\n\nFor the rawhide bones:\nBelle eats 2 rawhide bones per evening.\nCost per week = Cost per bone \u00d7 Number of bones per evening \u00d7 Number of days in a week\n            = $1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 7\n            = $14\n\nFor the dog biscuits:\nBelle eats 4 dog biscuits per evening.\nCost per week = Cost per biscuit \u00d7 Number of biscuits per evening \u00d7 Number of days in a week  \n            = $0.25 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 7\n            = $7\n\nTherefore, the total cost for a week of rawhide bones is $14, and the total cost for a week of dog biscuits is $7.\n\nAdding these together:\nTotal weekly cost = Cost of rawhide bones per week + Cost of dog biscuits per week\n                 = $14 + $7\n                 = $21\n\nSo the total cost to feed Belle these treats for a week is $21.",
