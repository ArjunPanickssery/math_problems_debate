          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question provides the total number of jelly beans (4000) and the fraction that are red (3/4). It also states that 1/4 of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored. To determine the number of coconut flavored jelly beans, we first need to calculate the number of red jelly beans, then take 1/4 of that.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1. Calculate the number of red jelly beans (3/4 of 4000)\n2. Take 1/4 of the red jelly beans to get the number of coconut flavored ones\n\nThe math_eval tool could be helpful for doing these calculations. The \"expr\" parameter can be set to the mathematical expressions needed.\n\nFirst, to get the number of red jelly beans:\nexpr = \"4000 * 3/4\"\n\nThen, to take 1/4 of the red jelly beans:\nexpr = \"previous_result * 1/4\"\n\nWhere previous_result is the output from the first math_eval call.\n\nNo other tools seem necessary, as the question provides all the information needed. The order of the math_eval calls is important, as the second depends on the output of the first.\n</thinking>",
