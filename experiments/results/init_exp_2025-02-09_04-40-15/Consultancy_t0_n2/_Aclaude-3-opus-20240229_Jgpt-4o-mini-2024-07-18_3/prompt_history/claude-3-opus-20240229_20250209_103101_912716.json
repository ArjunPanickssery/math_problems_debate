If she has $51 left, how much money, in dollars, did she have at first?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 204.0\nAfter buying the toy, Isabel has 51*2=102 dollars left.\nIsabel had 102*2=204 dollars at first.\n#### 204\n(A): 408.0\nWorking backwards from what's left:\n51 * 2 = 102 is the previous amount\n102 * 2 = 204 is the amount before that\n204 * 2 = 408 was the initial amount\n#### 408\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the mathematical process to determine the initial amount of money Isabel had based on the information provided? \n\nCan you explain how the spending of half the money affects the remaining balance after each transaction?\n\nIs there a step-by-step breakdown of the calculations that leads to the final amount left? \n\nWhich of the two possible answers aligns with the calculations derived from the spending pattern? \n\nAre there any assumptions or common pitfalls in solving this type of problem that I should be aware of? \n\nCan you confirm if both options (204 and 408) are derived from the same initial conditions? \n\nIs there any additional information or context that could influence the interpretation of the problem?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 204.0\nAfter buying the toy, Isabel has 51*2=102 dollars left.\nIsabel had 102*2=204 dollars at first.\n#### 204"
