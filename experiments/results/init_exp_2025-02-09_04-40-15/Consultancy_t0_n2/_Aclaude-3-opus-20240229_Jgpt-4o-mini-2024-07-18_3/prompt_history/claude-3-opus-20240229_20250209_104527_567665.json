          "content": "<thinking>\nThe question provides the following key information:\n- Sam played 100 matches in his first set of games\n- He won 50% of those first 100 matches \n- Sam then played another 100 matches\n- In the second set of 100 matches, he won 60%\n\nTo calculate the total number of matches Sam won, I need to:\n1. Calculate how many matches he won in the first 100 (100 * 0.5)\n2. Calculate how many matches he won in the next 100 (100 * 0.6) \n3. Add the wins from the first 100 and next 100 matches together\n\nThe formula to calculate wins based on a win percentage is:\nTotal Matches * Win Percentage = Number of Wins\n\nSam's overall win percentage across all 200 matches could be different than 60% since he had a lower 50% win rate in his first 100 matches. To get his overall percentage, I'd need to calculate his total wins across all 200 matches and divide by 200.\n\nI have the necessary information to calculate Sam's total wins using the percentages provided for each set of 100 matches, so I'll proceed with the calculations.\n</thinking>\n\nIn Sam's first 100 matches, he played a total of 100 matches. The question states he won 50% of those matches.",
