The problem statement mentions \"insects\" specifically, so based on that wording, it seems the intent is to only count true insects like ants and ladybugs, excluding the spiders. The tools provided do not seem directly relevant for answering this question, as it is more about interpreting the problem statement correctly.\n</thinking>\n\nNo, in this problem spiders should not be counted as insects. The question specifically asks \"How many insects are remaining in the playground?\". Scientifically, spiders are arachnids, not insects. They have 8 legs while insects have 6. The problem statement is careful to use the word \"insects\", so based on that precise wording, only the ants and ladybugs should be included in the final count, not the spiders that Sami found. The spiders are mentioned separately and not referred to as insects in the question.",
