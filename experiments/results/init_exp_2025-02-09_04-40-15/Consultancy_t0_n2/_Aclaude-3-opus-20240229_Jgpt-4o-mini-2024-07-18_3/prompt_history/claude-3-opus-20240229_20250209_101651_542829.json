If she gives away half of her blue shirts and a third of her brown shirts, how many shirts does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 37.0\nMary gives away 26/2 = 13 blue shirts.\nMary gives away 36/3 = 12 brown shirts.\nMary has 26-13 = 13 blue shirts left.\nMary has 36-12 = 24 brown shirts left.\nMary has 13+24 = 37 shirts left.\n#### 37\n(A): 35.0\nMary gives away 36/2 = 18 brown shirts.\nMary gives away 26/3 \u2248 9 blue shirts.\nMary has 26-9 = 17 blue shirts left.\nMary has 36-18 = 18 brown shirts left.\nMary has 17+18 = 35 shirts left.\n#### 35\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many blue shirts does Mary start with, and how many does she give away?  \nHow many brown shirts does Mary start with, and how many does she give away?  \nWhat is the formula used to calculate the number of shirts left after giving some away?  \nCan you confirm the calculations for both possible answers?  \nAre there any rules about rounding when dealing with fractions of shirts?  \nWhat are the total numbers of shirts left after the calculations for both answers?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 37.0\nMary gives away 26/2 = 13 blue shirts.\nMary gives away 36/3 = 12 brown shirts.\nMary has 26-13 = 13 blue shirts left.\nMary has 36-12 = 24 brown shirts left.\nMary has 13+24 = 37 shirts left.\n#### 37"
