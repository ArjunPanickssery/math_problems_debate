I can simply extract the relevant details from the question text to respond to the judge.\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the question, June found the following nests and eggs:\n\nFirst tree: 2 nests with 5 eggs each. So the nests in the first tree contain a total of 5 + 5 = 10 eggs.\n\nSecond tree: 1 nest with 3 eggs \n\nFront yard: 1 nest with 4 eggs\n\nSo to summarize:\n- First tree nests: 10 eggs total\n- Second tree nest: 3 eggs  \n- Front yard nest: 4 eggs\n\nThe answer I provided incorrectly stated there were \"2+5 = 7 eggs\" in the first tree. The correct number of eggs in the first tree nests is 10, not 7.",
