The question states that \"Emily's hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's hair.\" Since we know Logan's hair is 20 inches long, we can calculate Emily's hair length by adding 6 inches to Logan's hair length.\n\nNo tools are needed to answer this question, as it can be solved with simple addition based on the given information.\n</thinking>\n\nAccording to the question, Emily's hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's hair. We are also told that Logan's hair is 20 inches long. To find the length of Emily's hair, we simply need to add 6 inches to Logan's hair length:\n\nLogan's hair length: 20 inches\nEmily's hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's\nSo, Emily's hair length = Logan's hair length + 6 inches\n                        = 20 inches + 6 inches \n                        = 26 inches\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, Emily's hair is 26 inches long.",
