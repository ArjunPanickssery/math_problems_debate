This is a bit ambiguous - it could mean 2 packs total, or 2 packs per class. To argue for answer (A), I need to interpret this as meaning 2 packs per class.\n\nTo calculate the total packs, I just need to multiply the number of classes by the packs per class. No additional tools are needed.\n</thinking>\n\nThe number of index cards per pack is not specified in the problem and is not necessary to calculate the total packs John bought. The key information is that John bought 2 packs for each of his 6 classes.\n\nWhile knowing the number of students per class (30) allows us to calculate John's total students (180), this is not directly relevant to the question of how many total packs he purchased. The problem states John bought packs on a per-class basis (2 packs for each class), not on a per-student basis.\n\nSo to calculate the total packs, we simply multiply the number of classes (6) by the packs bought per class (2):",
