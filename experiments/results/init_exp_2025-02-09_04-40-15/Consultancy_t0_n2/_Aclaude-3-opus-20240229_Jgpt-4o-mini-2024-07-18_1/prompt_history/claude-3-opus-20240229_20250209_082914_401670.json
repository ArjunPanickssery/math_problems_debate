          "content": "To determine the initial amount, we work backwards from the $51 left at the end. Since Isabel spent half the remaining money to buy her brother a book, the amount before that purchase was $51 * 2 = $102.\n\nBefore buying the book, Isabel had $102. Since she spent half the amount to buy a toy prior to that, the amount she had before buying the toy was $102 * 2 = $204.\n\nTherefore, the initial amount Isabel had was $204 * 2 = $408. Each time Isabel spends half the money, the remaining balance doubles when working backwards.\n\nThe step-by-step breakdown is:\n$51 (current balance) * 2 = $102 (balance before buying book) \n$102 * 2 = $204 (balance before buying toy)\n$204 * 2 = $408 (initial amount)\n\nThe $408 answer aligns with these calculations. A common pitfall is stopping after one doubling, but there were two purchases.\n\nBoth $204 and $408 come from the same $51 ending balance, but $204 doesn't account for the first toy purchase. No additional context is needed - the spending pattern clearly leads to $408 as the initial amount Isabel had in her piggy bank.",
