          "content": "According to the first answer, there are 14 black cows. Half of the total 18 cows is 9, and adding 5 to that gives 14 black cows.\n\nThe second answer calculates black cows by adding 5 to the total number of cows (18+5=23), then taking half of that sum (23/2\u224812) to get 12 black cows. \n\nIn the context of the problem, \"half the cows\" refers to half of the total number of cows Sam has, which is 18. So half the cows is 18/2=9.\n\nThe total number of cows given in the question is 18.\n\nThe statement \"5 more than half the cows are black\" is clear. It means that the number of black cows is equal to 5 plus half of the total cows.\n\nIn a mathematical equation, \"5 more than half the cows\" can be interpreted as: black cows = 5 + (total cows / 2)\n\nWhile the second answer presents an alternative interpretation, the most straightforward reading of the problem aligns with the first answer's approach.\n\nTo solve this in the clearest way, first calculate half of the total cows (18/2=9), then add 5 to that to get the number of black cows (9+5=14). Finally, subtract the black cows from the total to find the non-black cows (18-14=4).",
