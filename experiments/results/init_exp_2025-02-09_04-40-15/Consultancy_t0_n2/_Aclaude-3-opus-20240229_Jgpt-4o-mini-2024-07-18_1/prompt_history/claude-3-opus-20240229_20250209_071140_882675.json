          "content": "The number of index cards in each pack is not specified in the question. However, it's not relevant to calculating the total number of packs John bought, as he is buying 2 packs per student regardless of pack size.\n\nThe number of students in each class is crucial for determining the total packs purchased. John has 6 classes with 30 students each, so the total number of students is 6*30=180. This is important because John is buying 2 packs for each individual student, not just 2 packs per class.\n\nAcross all 6 classes, John has a total of 180 students. To provide 2 packs to every student, he needs to buy 180*2=360 packs in total to accommodate all 180 students. Therefore, the correct answer is 360 packs.",
