If the shortest piece is 16 cm, how long was the entire wire before it was cut?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 96.0\nSince the shortest part is consists of 2 parts, then each part is equal to 16 cm/2 = 8 cm.\nThe whole wire was cut into 7 + 3 + 2 = 12 parts.\nHence, the wire was 8 cm x 12 = 96 cm long\n#### 96\n(B): 64\nIf we take the middle piece (ratio 3) as 16 cm, then each unit length is 16 \u00f7 3 = 5.33... cm\nFor ratio 7: 7 \u00d7 5.33... = 37.33... cm\nFor ratio 3: 16 cm\nFor ratio 2: 2 \u00d7 5.33... = 10.67... cm\nTotal length = 37.33... + 16 + 10.67... = 64 cm\n#### 64\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total number of parts in the ratio 7:3:2?  \nWhat is the value of each part if the shortest piece is 16 cm?  \nHow do you calculate the total length of the wire based on the parts?  \nCan you confirm the calculations for the total length using the ratios provided?  \nIs there a possibility that the shortest piece could correspond to a different ratio in the set?  \nHow would the total length change if the shortest piece were considered differently?  \n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 96.0\nSince the shortest part is consists of 2 parts, then each part is equal to 16 cm/2 = 8 cm.\nThe whole wire was cut into 7 + 3 + 2 = 12 parts.\nHence, the wire was 8 cm x 12 = 96 cm long\n#### 96"

Given that the shortest piece is 16 cm and corresponds to the ratio of 2, each part must be equal to 16 cm \u00f7 2 = 8 cm.\n\nTo calculate the total length of the wire, we multiply the value of each part (8 cm) by the total number of parts (12), resulting in a total length of 8 cm \u00d7 12 = 96 cm.\n\nWe can confirm this by calculating the lengths of each piece using the ratios:\n7 parts: 7 \u00d7 8 cm = 56 cm\n3 parts: 3 \u00d7 8 cm = 24 cm\n2 parts: 2 \u00d7 8 cm = 16 cm\nThe sum of these lengths is 56 cm + 24 cm + 16 cm = 96 cm, matching the total length calculated earlier.\n\nThere is no possibility that the shortest piece could correspond to a different ratio in the set, as the question clearly states that the shortest piece is 16 cm and is associated with the ratio of 2.\n\nTherefore, the total length of the wire before it was cut must be 96 cm, as calculated using the given ratios and the length of the shortest piece.",
