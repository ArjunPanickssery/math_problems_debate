          "content": "According to the question, Victoria has twice as many scoops of ice cream as Oli. Since Oli has 4 scoops, to calculate Victoria's total scoops we simply multiply Oli's scoops by 2:\n\n4 scoops (Oli's amount) \u00d7 2 = 8 scoops total for Victoria\n\nSo Victoria has 8 scoops of ice cream in total. No additional calculation is needed beyond doubling Oli's amount. \n\nTo determine how many more scoops Victoria has compared to Oli, we take Victoria's total of 8 scoops and subtract Oli's 4 scoops:\n\n8 scoops (Victoria's amount) - 4 scoops (Oli's amount) = 4 more scoops for Victoria\n\nTherefore, Victoria has 4 more scoops of ice cream than Oli.",
