          "content": "According to the problem, Maria receives 2 free flowers for each dozen purchased. She is buying a total of 3 dozens. So for the 3 dozens, she will get 3 x 2 = 6 free flowers in addition to the flowers in the dozens she's purchasing.\n\nOne dozen contains 12 flowers. So for the 3 dozens Maria is buying, the total number of flowers is 3 x 12 = 36 (not including the free ones).\n\nThe formula is:\nTotal flowers = (Number of dozens x Flowers per dozen) + Free flowers\n\nHowever, the possible answers differ in their interpretation of the free flowers. Answer A assumes the 2 free flowers are only given for each dozen. But answer B adds an extra 2 free flowers for the total purchase, in addition to the 2 per dozen. \n\nThe question does not specify that there are bonus free flowers for the total purchase beyond the 2 per dozen. So while answer B's calculation of 44 total flowers is arithmetically correct based on its interpretation, I believe this interpretation adds an unconfirmed assumption.\n\nTherefore, answer A's calculation of 42 total flowers appears to more closely match the information given in the original question. The 2 free flowers seem to only be awarded per individual dozen purchased.",
