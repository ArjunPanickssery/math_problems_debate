      "content": "QUESTION: Tara has a shoebox that is 4 inches tall and 6 inches wide. She puts a square block inside that is 4 inches per side. How many square inches of the box are left uncovered?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 8.0\nThe shoebox is 24 square inches because 4 x 6 = 24\nThe block is 16 square inches because 4 x 4 = 16\nThere are 8 square inches uncovered because 24 - 16 = 8\n#### 8\n(B): 4\nThe shoebox perimeter is 20 (4 + 6) \u00d7 2\nThe block perimeter is 16: 4 \u00d7 4\nThe uncovered space is 20 - 16\n#### 4\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total surface area of the shoebox that is exposed, considering its dimensions? \n\nHow is the area of the square block calculated in relation to the shoebox's dimensions? \n\nCan you clarify how the uncovered area is determined in both options (A) and (B)? \n\nAre the calculations for perimeter relevant to determining the uncovered area of the shoebox? \n\nIs there any additional information about the shoebox that might affect the area calculation?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 8.0\nThe shoebox is 24 square inches because 4 x 6 = 24\nThe block is 16 square inches because 4 x 4 = 16\nThere are 8 square inches uncovered because 24 - 16 = 8\n#### 8"

          "content": "To calculate the uncovered area, we only need to consider the bottom surface of the shoebox, which has dimensions of 4 inches by 6 inches. This gives a total area of 24 square inches for the shoebox bottom (4 x 6 = 24).\n\nThe square block has sides of 4 inches each. To calculate its area, we multiply the length of one side by itself. So the area of the block is 16 square inches (4 x 4 = 16).\n\nOption (A) correctly determines the uncovered area by subtracting the area of the block (16 sq in) from the area of the shoebox bottom (24 sq in). This leaves 8 square inches uncovered (24 - 16 = 8).\n\nOption (B) incorrectly uses the perimeter, which is the distance around the outside, rather than the area. The perimeter is not relevant for calculating the uncovered area.\n\nNo additional information about the shoebox is needed, as the height of the shoebox does not affect the uncovered area on the bottom surface where the block sits.",
