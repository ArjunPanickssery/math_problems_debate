The 3 boxes contain a total of 14 \u00d7 3 = 42 apples. \n\nIn one week, which has 7 days, Henry and his brother will eat 2 apples/day \u00d7 7 days = 14 apples together.\n\nThe 42 total apples are being shared equally between Henry and his brother. Each person gets half, which is 42 \u00f7 2 = 21 apples per person.\n\nTo calculate the duration the apples will last, divide each person's share of 21 apples by their individual daily consumption of 1 apple/day:\n21 apples \u00f7 1 apple/day = 21 days per person\n\nSince there are 7 days in a week, convert the 21 days to weeks:\n21 days \u00f7 7 days/week = 3 weeks\n\nTherefore, by each eating 1 apple a day, Henry and his brother can make the 3 boxes of apples last for 3 weeks.",
