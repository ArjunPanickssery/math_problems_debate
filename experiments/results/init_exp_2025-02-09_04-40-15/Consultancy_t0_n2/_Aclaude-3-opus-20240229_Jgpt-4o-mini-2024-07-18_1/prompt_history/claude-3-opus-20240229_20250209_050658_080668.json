So the total number of students he teaches each day is:\n\n30 students/class * 6 classes = 180 students\n\nSince he gives 10 index cards to each student, the total number of index cards he needs is:\n\n180 students * 10 cards/student = 1800 index cards\n\nThe index cards come in packs of 50. To calculate the number of packs Carl needs to buy, we divide the total cards needed by the number of cards per pack:\n\n1800 cards / 50 cards/pack = 36 packs\n\nEach pack of index cards costs $3. Therefore, the total expenditure is:\n\n36 packs * $3/pack = $108\n\nSo I can confirm that the total amount Carl spent on index cards is $108.",
