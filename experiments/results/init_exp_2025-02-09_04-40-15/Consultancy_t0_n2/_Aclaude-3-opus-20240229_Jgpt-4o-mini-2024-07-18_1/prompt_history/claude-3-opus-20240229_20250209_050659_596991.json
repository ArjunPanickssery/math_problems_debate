          "content": "Twenty years ago, Shane was 2 times older than Garret is now. Since Garret is currently 12, that means Shane was 12 * 2 = 24 years old twenty years ago.\n\nThe age difference between Shane and Garret is 24 years. Shane was 24 when Garret was born, and remains 24 years older than Garret.\n\nI can confirm that twenty years ago, Shane was indeed 24 based on Garret currently being 12. The problem states Shane was 2 times Garret's current age of 12 back then, which is 24.\n\nIn the 20 years that have passed, both Shane and Garret aged by 20 years. So Shane went from 24 to 44, while Garret went from not born yet to 12.\n\nThere is no additional context given that would change the interpretation. The problem clearly states the key facts - Garret's current age, the age ratio 20 years ago, and the time passed. This is sufficient to calculate Shane's current age as 44.",
