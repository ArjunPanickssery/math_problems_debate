Since Stu has 9 books, we can calculate Albert's books by multiplying Stu's books by 4:\n\nAlbert's books = 4 * Stu's books\n                = 4 * 9 \n                = 36 books\n\nSo Albert has 36 books, which is 4 times the number of books Stu has (9).\n\n\nBased on the information and arguments above, give a probability between 0 and 1 that you think answer A is correct.\n\nYou must give your answer in the form\n\n{'prob': (some float between 0 and 1)}"
