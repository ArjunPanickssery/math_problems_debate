          "content": "In Jame's new job, he earns $20 per hour and works 40 hours per week. So his weekly earnings at the new job are $20 * 40 = $800.\n\nIn his old job, Jame earned $16 per hour and worked 25 hours per week. Therefore, his weekly earnings at the old job were $16 * 25 = $400.\n\nJame works 52 weeks in a year.\n\nTo calculate the difference in annual earnings, we first find the difference in hourly pay rates, which is $20 - $16 = $4 per hour. We then multiply this by the hours worked at the new job, 40 hours, giving an increase of $4 * 40 = $160 per week. \n\nFinally, multiplying the weekly increase by 52 weeks in a year yields the annual difference:\n$160 * 52 = $8,320",
