This is basic multiplication - if something is \"times\" another number, we multiply. The phrase \"4 times as many\" specifically indicates multiplication, not addition. Therefore, Albert has 36 books, and when we add Stu's 9 books, we get a total of 45 books. This interpretation follows the standard mathematical meaning of \"times as many\" and is the only logically correct way to solve this problem.\n\n\nBased on the information and arguments above, give a probability between 0 and 1 that you think answer B is correct.\n\nYou must give your answer in the form\n\n{'prob': (some float between 0 and 1)}"
