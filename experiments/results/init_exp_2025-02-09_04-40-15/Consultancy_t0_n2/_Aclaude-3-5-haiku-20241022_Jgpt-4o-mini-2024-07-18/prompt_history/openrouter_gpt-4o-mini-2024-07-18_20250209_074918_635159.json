Since Stu has 9 books, Albert must have 4 * 9 = 36 books. To find the total number of books, we simply add Stu's books and Albert's books: 9 + 36 = 45. This directly matches answer choice (A) of 45.0. The key is carefully following the problem's statement that Albert has 4 times as many books as Stu, which means multiplying Stu's book count by 4 to determine Albert's book count. Then adding these together gives the total number of books.\n\n\nBased on the information and arguments above, give a probability between 0 and 1 that you think answer A is correct.\n\nYou must give your answer in the form\n\n{'prob': (some float between 0 and 1)}"
