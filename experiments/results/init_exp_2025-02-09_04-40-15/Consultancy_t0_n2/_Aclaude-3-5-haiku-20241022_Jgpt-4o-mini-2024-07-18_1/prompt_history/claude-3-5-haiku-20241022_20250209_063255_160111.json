          "content": "Your Honor, let me clarify the sales figures and calculations for Companies A and B:\n\nCompany A:\n- Price per bottle: $4\n- Number of bottles sold: 300\n- Total sales: 300 * $4 = $1,200\n\nCompany B:\n- Price per bottle: $3.50\n- Number of bottles sold: 350\n- Total sales: 350 * $3.50 = $1,225\n\nThe difference in earnings is precisely $25, with Company B earning slightly more due to both higher volume and a lower price point. The calculation is straightforward multiplication of price per bottle by number of bottles sold, showing Company B's marginal advantage.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of these calculations?",
