          "content": "I'll address the judge's inquiries systematically to support the answer of 144 hours:\n\nYour Honor, let me clarify the details:\n\n1. Melissa makes two trips to town each month. This is explicitly stated in the original problem description.\n\n2. Each round trip takes 3 hours to town and 3 hours back, totaling 6 hours per complete trip. This means for two trips monthly, she drives 6 \u00d7 2 = 12 hours per month.\n\n3. There are 12 months in a standard year. Therefore, 12 monthly trips \u00d7 12 hours per month = 144 total driving hours annually.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward and consistent with the problem's given information. The time remains constant each trip, with no mentioned variations affecting her driving duration.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this calculation?",
