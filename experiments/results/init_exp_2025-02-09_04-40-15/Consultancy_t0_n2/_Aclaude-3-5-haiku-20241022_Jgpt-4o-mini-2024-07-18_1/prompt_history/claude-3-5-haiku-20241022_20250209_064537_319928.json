          "content": "Your Honor, I will systematically demonstrate why Answer (A) of 63 marbles is correct:\n\n1. Katrina's Marbles:\nMabel has 85 marbles, and the problem states she has 5 times Katrina's marbles. Therefore, Katrina has 85 \u00f7 5 = 17 marbles. This is a precise calculation based on the given information.\n\n2. Amanda's Marbles:\nThe problem states Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice Katrina's marbles. So Amanda currently has 34 - 12 = 22 marbles. We can verify: 22 + 12 = 34, which is twice Katrina's 17 marbles.\n\n3. Difference in Mabel's and Amanda's Marbles:\nMabel has 85 marbles, Amanda has 22 marbles. 85 - 22 = 63, which directly answers the question of how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda.\n\nEach step is logically connected and mathematically sound.",
