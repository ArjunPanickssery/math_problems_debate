How many more of these books has Peter read than his brother?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 6.0\nPeter has read 8 of these books because 20 x .4 = 8\nHis brother has read 2 of these books because 20 x .1 = 2\nPeter has read 6 more books than his brother because 8 - 2 = 6\n#### 6\n(B): 120\nPeter has read 8 of these books because 20 x .4 = 8\nHis brother has read 2 of these books because 20 x .1 = 2\nThe difference of 6 books needs to be scaled by the total collection size of 20 books to get the final answer: 6 x 20 = 120\n#### 120\n"
