          "content": "Your Honor, let me clarify the calculation for Emily's hair length. \n\nThe problem states that Emily's hair is 6 inches longer than Logan's hair. Logan's hair is 20 inches long. Therefore, to find Emily's hair length, we add 6 inches to Logan's hair length: 20 + 6 = 26 inches.\n\nThis means Emily's hair is 26 inches long, which directly supports the solution that Kate's hair, being half of Emily's, would be 13 inches long. The mathematical progression is clear and precise: Logan (20 inches) \u2192 Emily (26 inches) \u2192 Kate (13 inches).",
