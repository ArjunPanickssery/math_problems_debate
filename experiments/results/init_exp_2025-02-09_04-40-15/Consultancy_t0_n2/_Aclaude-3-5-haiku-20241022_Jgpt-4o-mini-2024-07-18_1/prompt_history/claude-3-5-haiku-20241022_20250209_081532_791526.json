In the first 100 games, Sam played exactly 100 matches.\n2. In the first 100 matches, Sam won 50% (50 out of 100 matches).\n3. In the next 100 games, Sam played exactly 100 matches.\n4. In the next 100 matches, Sam won 60% (60 out of 100 matches).\n5. Total wins formula: Total matches * Win percentage\n6. Yes, the overall win percentage can differ from individual set percentages due to weighted averages.\n7. Calculation confirmed: 200 * 0.6 = 120 total wins\n\nThe key is looking at the overall win rate across all matches, which is 60%, resulting in 120 total wins.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific point?",
