          "content": "I'll respond to the judge's inquiries to support the answer of 750 coconut-flavored jelly beans:\n\nYour Honor, let me clarify the calculation step by step:\n\nFirst, we have 4,000 total jelly beans in the jar. Three-fourths of these are red, which means 3,000 jelly beans are red (4,000 \u00d7 3/4 = 3,000). \n\nOf these red jelly beans, one-quarter are coconut flavored. So to find the coconut-flavored red jelly beans, we calculate: 3,000 \u00d7 1/4 = 750.\n\nThis precise calculation demonstrates that 750 jelly beans are coconut flavored red jelly beans. The math is straightforward and follows the problem's given fractions systematically.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this calculation?",
