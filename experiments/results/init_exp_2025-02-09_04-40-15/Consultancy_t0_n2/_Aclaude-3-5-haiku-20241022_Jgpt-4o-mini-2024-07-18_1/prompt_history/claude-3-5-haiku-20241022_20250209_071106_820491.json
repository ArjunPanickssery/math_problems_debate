      "content": "QUESTION: A farmer gets 20 pounds of bacon on average from a pig. He sells each pound for $6 at the monthly farmer\u2019s market. This month\u2019s pig is a runt that grew to only half the size of the average pig. How many dollars will the farmer make from the pig\u2019s bacon?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nThe pig grew to half the size of the average pig, so it will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nThe rancher will make 10 * 6 = $60 from the pig\u2019s bacon.\n#### 60\n(A): 30.0\nThe pig will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nEach pound will sell for 6 / 2 = $3.\nThe farmer will make 10 * 3 = $30 from the pig's bacon.\n#### 30\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow much bacon does an average pig produce?  \nWhat is the selling price per pound of bacon?  \nIf the pig is half the size, how much bacon will it produce?  \nIs the selling price per pound affected by the size of the pig?  \nWhat is the total revenue calculation for the bacon from the runt pig?  \nIs there any reason to believe the farmer would sell the bacon for a different price than usual?  \n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 60.0\nThe pig grew to half the size of the average pig, so it will produce 20 / 2 = 10 pounds of bacon.\nThe rancher will make 10 * 6 = $60 from the pig\u2019s bacon.\n#### 60"

          "content": "I'll address each of the judge's questions to support the answer of $60:\n\nAn average pig produces 20 pounds of bacon. The standard selling price is $6 per pound at the farmer's market. When the pig is half the size, it will logically produce 10 pounds of bacon (20 \u00f7 2 = 10). The size of the pig does not affect the selling price - a pound of bacon remains $6 regardless of the pig's overall size. Therefore, 10 pounds multiplied by $6 per pound results in $60 total revenue. There's no indication of price variation based on the pig's size, so the farmer will sell at the standard market rate.\n\nThe key point is that the price per pound remains constant, so the reduced quantity is the only factor changing the total revenue.",
