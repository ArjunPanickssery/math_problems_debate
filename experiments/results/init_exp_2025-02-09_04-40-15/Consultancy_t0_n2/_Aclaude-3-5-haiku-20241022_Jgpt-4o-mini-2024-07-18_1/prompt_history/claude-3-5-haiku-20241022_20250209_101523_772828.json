          "content": "Your Honor, let me clarify the calculation step by step:\n\nThe question clearly states a cat has nine lives. This is a fundamental starting point. Regarding the dog's lives, the problem specifies the dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So if a cat has 9 lives, the dog would have 9 - 3 = 6 lives.\n\nFor the mouse, the problem states it has 7 more lives than a dog. Since the dog has 6 lives, the mouse would consequently have 6 + 7 = 13 lives.\n\nThe arithmetic is straightforward: 9 (cat) - 3 = 6 (dog), then 6 + 7 = 13 (mouse). Each step follows logically from the problem's stated relationships.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this calculation?",
