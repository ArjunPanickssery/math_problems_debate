          "content": "Your Honor, let me clarify the relationship between Kylie and Kayla's apple picking.\n\nThe key equation is Kayla's apples = 4(x+10), where x represents Kylie's apples. This means Kayla's apple count is four times Kylie's apples, plus an additional 10 apples. This formulation captures the problem's core condition that Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times Kylie's amount.\n\nWhen we algebraically solve this equation, we find x = 60 (Kylie's apples), and consequently, Kayla picks 4(60+10) = 4(70) = 280 apples. This precisely matches the problem's total of 340 apples when we add Kylie's and Kayla's amounts.\n\nThe equation 4(x+10) provides a more accurate representation of their picking relationship compared to the alternative solution.",
