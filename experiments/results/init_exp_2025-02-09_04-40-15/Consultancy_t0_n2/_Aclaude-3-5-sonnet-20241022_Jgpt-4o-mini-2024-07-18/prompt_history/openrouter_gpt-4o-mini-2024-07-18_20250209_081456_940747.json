      "content": "QUESTION: A gallon of whole milk that normally costs $3 is now sold at $2. A box of cereal was sold at a discount of $1. How much will you save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 8.0\nThe discount for each gallon of whole milk is $3 - $2 = $1.\nSo the discount for 3 gallons of whole milk is $1/gallon x 3 gallons = $3.\nThe total discount for 5 boxes of cereal is $1/box x 5 boxes = $5.\nYou will save $3 + $5 = $8 for 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal.\n#### 8\n(B): 2.0\nFor milk:\nThe discount per gallon is $2 - $3 = -$1\nFor 3 gallons: -$1 \u00d7 3 = -$3\nFor cereal:\nThe discount is $1 per box\nFor 5 boxes: $1 \u00d7 5 = $5\nTotal savings is -$3 + $5 = $2\n#### 2\n"
