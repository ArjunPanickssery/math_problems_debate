      "content": "QUESTION: Tara has a shoebox that is 4 inches tall and 6 inches wide. She puts a square block inside that is 4 inches per side. How many square inches of the box are left uncovered?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 8.0\nThe shoebox is 24 square inches because 4 x 6 = 24\nThe block is 16 square inches because 4 x 4 = 16\nThere are 8 square inches uncovered because 24 - 16 = 8\n#### 8\n(B): 4\nThe shoebox perimeter is 20 (4 + 6) \u00d7 2\nThe block perimeter is 16: 4 \u00d7 4\nThe uncovered space is 20 - 16\n#### 4\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total surface area of the shoebox that is exposed, considering its dimensions? \n\nHow is the area of the square block calculated in relation to the shoebox's dimensions? \n\nCan you clarify how the uncovered area is determined in both options (A) and (B)? \n\nAre the calculations for perimeter relevant to determining the uncovered area of the shoebox? \n\nIs there any additional information about the shoebox that might affect the area calculation?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 8.0\nThe shoebox is 24 square inches because 4 x 6 = 24\nThe block is 16 square inches because 4 x 4 = 16\nThere are 8 square inches uncovered because 24 - 16 = 8\n#### 8"
