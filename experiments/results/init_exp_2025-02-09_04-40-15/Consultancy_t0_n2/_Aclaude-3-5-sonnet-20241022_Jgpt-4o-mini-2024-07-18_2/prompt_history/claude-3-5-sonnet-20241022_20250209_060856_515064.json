If she paid $480, how much was the original price of the pair of shoes?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 600.0\nLyra only paid $480 for the pair of shoes which is only 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.\nSo let x be the original price.\nThen 0.8x = $480\nThus x = $480 / 0.8 = $600\n#### 600\n(A): 576\nThe discount amount is 20% of $480 = $96\nThe original price is $480 + $96 = $576\n#### 576\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the formula to calculate the original price when a discount is applied?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 600.0\nLyra only paid $480 for the pair of shoes which is only 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.\nSo let x be the original price.\nThen 0.8x = $480\nThus x = $480 / 0.8 = $600\n#### 600"

When an item is discounted by 20%, the price paid represents 80% (100% - 20%) of the original price. Therefore, to find the original price, we must divide the discounted price by 0.8 (or 80%).\n\nLet me demonstrate why this works:",
