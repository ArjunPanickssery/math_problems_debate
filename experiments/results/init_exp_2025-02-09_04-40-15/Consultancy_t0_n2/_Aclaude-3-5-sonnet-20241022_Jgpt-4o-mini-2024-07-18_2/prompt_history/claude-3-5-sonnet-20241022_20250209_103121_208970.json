          "content": "Mr. Curtis has exactly 297 hens. The 20 non-laying hens are already part of this total, not additional hens. This is a crucial distinction that answer B misses.\n\nIn this context, hens and roosters are clearly defined: roosters are male chickens (28), and hens are female chickens (297). The total cannot exceed 325 chickens, which is why adding 20 to 297 would be incorrect. The 20 non-laying hens are already included in the 297 total hens.\n\nThe relationship is straightforward: out of 297 total hens, 20 don't lay eggs, but this doesn't change the total number of hens. They're still hens whether they lay eggs or not. Therefore, all 297 hens are egg-laying hens except for the 20 non-layers, leaving us with 297 egg-laying hens.\n\nRegarding miscounting, the numbers given are precise and clearly stated in the problem. The calculation is simple subtraction: 325 total chickens minus 28 roosters equals 297 hens, which is our answer for egg-laying hens.",
