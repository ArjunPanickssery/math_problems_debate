How far does he move horizontally, in feet?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2700.0\nHe travels 1450-100=1350 feet vertically\nSo he travels 1350*2=2700 feet horizontally\n#### 2700\n(B): 2900.0\nHe reaches an elevation of 1450 feet\nSince he moves 2 feet horizontally for each vertical foot, he travels 1450*2=2900 feet horizontally\n#### 2900\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total vertical distance John climbs from 100 feet to 1450 feet? \n\nHow is the horizontal distance related to the vertical distance in this scenario? \n\nCan you confirm the ratio of horizontal distance to vertical distance that John travels? \n\nWhat would be the correct calculation for horizontal distance based on the vertical distance climbed? \n\nIs there a specific formula or method to determine the total horizontal distance from the vertical distance in this context?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 2700.0\nHe travels 1450-100=1350 feet vertically\nSo he travels 1350*2=2700 feet horizontally\n#### 2700"
