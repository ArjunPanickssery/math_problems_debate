How much does she have left?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 50.0\nThe housewife has 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 of $150 left.\nThis means she has $150 * (1/3) = $50 left.\n#### 50\n(A): 100.0\nFirst calculate what fraction remains: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\nSince 2/3 was spent, multiply $150 by 2/3: $150 * (2/3) = $100\nThis is the amount she has left.\n#### 100\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total amount the housewife started with?  \nHow much did she spend in dollar terms?  \nWhat is the correct way to calculate the remaining amount after spending?  \nCan you confirm the fractions used in the calculations?  \nIs it possible that the housewife has spent more than she had?  \nHow do you interpret the fractions in the context of the total amount?  \nAre there any common mistakes people make in similar calculations?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 100.0\nFirst calculate what fraction remains: 3/3 - 2/3 = 1/3\nSince 2/3 was spent, multiply $150 by 2/3: $150 * (2/3) = $100\nThis is the amount she has left.\n#### 100"
