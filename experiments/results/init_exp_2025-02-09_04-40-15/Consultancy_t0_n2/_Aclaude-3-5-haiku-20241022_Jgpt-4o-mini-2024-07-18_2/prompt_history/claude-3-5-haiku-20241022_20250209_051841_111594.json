If the Biology class has half as many students as the Physics class, how many boys are in the Biology class?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 25.0\nThe Biology class has 200/2=100 students.\nThe boys in the Biology class are 1/4*100=25 students.\n#### 25\n(B): 33.33\nThe Biology class has 200/2=100 students.\nSince there are three times as many girls, divide total by 3 to get boys: 100/3\u224833.33\n#### 33.33\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many total students are there in the Biology class?  \nWhat is the ratio of girls to boys in the Biology class?  \nIf the Biology class has 100 students, how many boys would there be if the ratio of girls to boys is 3:1?  \nHow is the total number of boys calculated based on the ratio of girls to boys?  \nIs it correct to divide the total number of students by the number of groups (girls and boys) to find the number of boys?  \n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 25.0\nThe Biology class has 200/2=100 students.\nThe boys in the Biology class are 1/4*100=25 students.\n#### 25"
