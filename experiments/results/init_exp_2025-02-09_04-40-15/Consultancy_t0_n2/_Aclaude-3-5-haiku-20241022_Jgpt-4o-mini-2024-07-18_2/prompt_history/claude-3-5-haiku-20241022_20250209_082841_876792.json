How many insects are remaining in the playground?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 21.0\nThe children find 3 + 12 + 8 = 23 insects.\nAfter the ladybugs fly away, there are 23 - 2 = 21 insects.\n#### 21\n(A): 18.0\nLet's count the remaining insects:\nAnts remain constant at 12\nFor ladybugs, start with 8 and subtract 2 that flew = 6 ladybugs\nSpiders are not counted in our insect total\nSo total insects = 12 + 6 = 18\n#### 18\n### Enquiry from judge:\nAre spiders classified as insects in this context?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 21.0\nThe children find 3 + 12 + 8 = 23 insects.\nAfter the ladybugs fly away, there are 23 - 2 = 21 insects.\n#### 21"
