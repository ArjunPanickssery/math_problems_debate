      "content": "QUESTION: John wants to finish a show in 5 days.  There are 20 episodes and they are each 30 minutes long.  How many hours does he have to watch a day?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 2.0\nHe wants to watch 20*30=600 minutes\nSo he needs to watch 600/60=10 hours\nThat means he needs to watch 10/5=2 hours a day\n#### 2\n(B): 1.2\nFirst find total minutes: 20 * 30 = 600 minutes\nConvert to hours: 600 / 100 = 6 hours total\nDivide by 5 days: 6 / 5 = 1.2 hours per day\n#### 1.2\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the total number of minutes in 20 episodes if each episode is 30 minutes long?  \nHow do you convert minutes to hours?  \nWhat is the correct way to divide total hours by the number of days to find the daily viewing requirement?  \nIs there any discrepancy in the calculations provided in the possible answers?  \nCan you confirm if 600 minutes equals 10 hours?  \nWhat is 600 minutes divided by 5 days?  \nWhat is the correct conversion from minutes to hours?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 2.0\nHe wants to watch 20*30=600 minutes\nSo he needs to watch 600/60=10 hours\nThat means he needs to watch 10/5=2 hours a day\n#### 2"
