How many total toys does he buy?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 60.0\nHe buys 2*20=40 toy cars\nSo the total number of toys is 20+40=60\n#### 60\n(A): 40.0\nHe buys twice as many toy soldiers as cars\nThis means he buys 2*20=40 toy soldiers\nThis is the total number of toys\n#### 40\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many toy soldiers does James buy?  \nIs the total number of toys calculated by adding the number of toy cars and toy soldiers?  \nWhat is the correct interpretation of \"twice as many\"?  \nCan you confirm the number of toy cars James bought?  \nIs there any ambiguity in the question regarding the total count of toys?  \n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (A): 40.0\nHe buys twice as many toy soldiers as cars\nThis means he buys 2*20=40 toy soldiers\nThis is the total number of toys\n#### 40"
