How old am I now?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(A): 17.0\nIn 2 years, my dog will be 4 years old, so my dog is 4 - 2 = 2 years old now.\nSo I am 15 + 2 = 17 years old now.\n#### 17\n(B): 19.0\nI was 15 when my dog was born. My dog will be 4 years old in 2 years.\nSo my current age is 15 + 4 = 19 years old.\n#### 19\n"
