The box has 120 crayons, with one-third (40) being new and 20% (24) broken. The remaining crayons are slightly used.

First, 40 crayons are classified as new, calculated as one-third of 120. The percentage of broken crayons is 20%, but this applies to the remaining 80 crayons after removing the new ones, resulting in 16 broken crayons.
