The formula used to calculate the shirts left is: initial number minus the number given away. For blue shirts: 26 - 13 = 13. For brown shirts: 36 - 12 = 24. Adding these gives 13 + 24 = 37 shirts left. There are no fractions of shirts to round here, as the divisions result in whole numbers. Thus, the correct total is 37 shirts.",
