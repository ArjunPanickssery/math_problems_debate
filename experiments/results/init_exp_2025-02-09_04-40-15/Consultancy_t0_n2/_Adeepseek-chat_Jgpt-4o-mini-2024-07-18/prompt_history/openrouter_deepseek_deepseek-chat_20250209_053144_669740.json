The mouse has 7 more lives than the dog, so 12 + 7 = 19 lives. These calculations are straightforward and align with the relationships provided. Common misconceptions might arise from the phrase \"a cat has nine lives,\" but the question clearly defines the relationships. There\u2019s no indication the information is incorrect; thus, the mouse has 19 lives.",
