          "content": "Maddy needs 120 credits to graduate, spread over 8 semesters. Each class provides 3 credits. To calculate the number of classes per semester, first divide the total credits by the credits per class: 120 / 3 = 40 classes. Then, divide by the number of semesters: 40 / 8 = 5 classes per semester. This calculation is straightforward and accurate. While some students may take more classes, 5 per semester is manageable and aligns with standard academic loads. There are no restrictions mentioned, but 5 classes ensure steady progress without overburdening Maddy. This approach is both practical and efficient.",
