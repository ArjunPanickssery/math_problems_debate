          "content": "According to the first answer, there are 14 black cows. The method used in the second answer calculates black cows by adding 5 to the total number of cows (18 + 5 = 23) and then taking half of that (12). \"Half the cows\" refers to half of the total cows, which is 9. The total number of cows is 18. The statement \"5 more than half the cows are black\" is clear: it means the number of black cows is 5 more than half of 18. The most straightforward approach is to take half of 18 (9) and add 5, resulting in 14 black cows and 4 non-black cows.",
