          "content": "Let me address your questions to show why answer (A) 25 is correct:\n\nThe Biology class has 100 students (half of Physics' 200 students). The ratio of girls to boys is 3:1, meaning for every 1 boy, there are 3 girls. This creates 4 parts total (3 parts girls + 1 part boys = 4 parts).\n\nTo find the number of boys, we need to find 1/4 of the total students since boys represent one part out of four total parts. With 100 total students, we calculate 100 \u00f7 4 = 25 boys.\n\nIt would be incorrect to divide by 3 (as in answer B) because that ignores that boys make up one part of the total four parts. The ratio 3:1 means we divide the total by 4, not by 3.",
