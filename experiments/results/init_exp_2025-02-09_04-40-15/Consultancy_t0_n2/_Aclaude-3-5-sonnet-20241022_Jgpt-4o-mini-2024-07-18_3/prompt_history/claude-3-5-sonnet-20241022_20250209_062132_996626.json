How much will she save in May?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 160.0\nBrianne saves $10 x 2 = $20 in February.\nShe will save $20 x 2 = $40 in March.\nShe will save $40 x 2 = $80 in April.\nTherefore, she will save $80 x 2 = $160 in May.\n#### 160\n(A): 810.0\nStarting with $10 in January\nFor February: $10 becomes $30\nFor March: $30 becomes $90\nFor April: $90 becomes $270\nFor May: $270 becomes $810\n#### 810\n### Enquiry from judge:\nWhat is the saving pattern for Brianne each month? Does she save double the amount from the previous month or a different calculation?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 160.0\nBrianne saves $10 x 2 = $20 in February.\nShe will save $20 x 2 = $40 in March.\nShe will save $40 x 2 = $80 in April.\nTherefore, she will save $80 x 2 = $160 in May.\n#### 160"

          "content": "The question clearly states that \"Each month, she saves twice as much as her previous month's savings.\" This means we use a simple doubling pattern. For example, if she saves $10 in January, February must be $20 (double of $10), March must be $40 (double of $20), and so on. The pattern is straightforward multiplication by 2 each time, not adding to the previous amount. Answer A incorrectly adds to the previous amount instead of just doubling it. The correct pattern is: $10 \u2192 $20 \u2192 $40 \u2192 $80 \u2192 $160.",
