Therefore, his weekly reading amount is 100 pages \u00d7 3 days = 300 pages per week. This is clearly stated in the problem that he only reads on these three specific days, not every day of the week. The calculation of 300 pages per week is essential for determining the total time needed to complete the 2100-page book.",
