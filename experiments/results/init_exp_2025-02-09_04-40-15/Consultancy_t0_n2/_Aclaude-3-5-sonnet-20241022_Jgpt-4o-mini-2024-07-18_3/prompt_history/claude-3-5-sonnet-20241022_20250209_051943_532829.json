          "content": "Let me clarify the calculation:\n\nThe problem states there are 6 more green bowling balls than red ones. Since there are 30 red bowling balls, we calculate the number of green balls by adding 6 to 30, which gives us 36 green bowling balls. This follows the direct statement \"6 more green bowling balls than red.\"\n\nTo find the total, we simply add the number of red balls (30) and green balls (36):\n30 + 36 = 66 total bowling balls\n\nThis is the correct calculation because we've already accounted for the \"+6\" difference when calculating the number of green balls. Adding an extra 6 to the total would be counting that difference twice.",
