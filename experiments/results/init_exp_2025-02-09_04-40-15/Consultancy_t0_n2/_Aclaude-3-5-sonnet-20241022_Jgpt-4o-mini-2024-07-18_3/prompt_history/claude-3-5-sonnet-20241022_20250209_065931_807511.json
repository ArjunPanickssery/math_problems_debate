This is clearly stated in the problem where it mentions \"twice as many guitars\" compared to the basses. This calculation is crucial because it affects how many 8-string guitars we'll need, as the problem states there are \"3 fewer 8 string guitars than the normal guitars,\" meaning 6 - 3 = 3 would be incorrect.
