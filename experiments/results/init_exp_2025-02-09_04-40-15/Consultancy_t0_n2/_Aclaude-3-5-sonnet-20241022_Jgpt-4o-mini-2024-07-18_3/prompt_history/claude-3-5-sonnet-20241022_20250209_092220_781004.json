          "content": "Let me clarify the relationship between Kylie and Kayla's apples. The question states that \"Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked.\" This translates directly to:\n\nKayla's apples = 4(Kylie's apples) + 10\n\nIf we let x = Kylie's apples, then:\nKayla's apples = 4x + 10\n\nThis is exactly what we used in solution (A). The relationship is a linear equation where Kayla picked 4 times Kylie's amount plus 10 more apples. Solution (B) incorrectly interprets this as 4(x+10), which would mean \"4 times (Kylie's apples plus 10)\" - that's not what the question states.",
