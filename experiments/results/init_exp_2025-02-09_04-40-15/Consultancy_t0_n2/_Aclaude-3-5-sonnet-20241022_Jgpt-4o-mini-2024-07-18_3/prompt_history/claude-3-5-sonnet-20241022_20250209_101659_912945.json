          "content": "Let me address your questions while arguing for answer (B) 56 crayons:\n\nThe problem clearly states one-third of 120 crayons are new, which is 40 crayons (120 \u00f7 3 = 40). This is a straightforward calculation.\n\n20% of the total 120 crayons are broken, which means 24 crayons (120 \u00d7 0.20 = 24). This percentage applies to the total number, not the remaining amount after removing new crayons.\n\nThe slightly used crayons are what remains after subtracting both new and broken crayons from the total: 120 - 40 - 24 = 56 crayons. This is the most logical approach because:\n1. We start with the total (120)\n2. Remove the known quantities (40 new, 24 broken)\n3. What's left must be slightly used\n\nAnswer (A) incorrectly applies the 20% broken calculation to the remaining crayons after removing new ones, which doesn't align with the original statement that 20% of ALL crayons are broken.",
