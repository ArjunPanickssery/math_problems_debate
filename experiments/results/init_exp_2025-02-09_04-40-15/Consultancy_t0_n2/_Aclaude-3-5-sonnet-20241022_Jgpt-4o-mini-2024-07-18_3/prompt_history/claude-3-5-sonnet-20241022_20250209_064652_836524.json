          "content": "Let me address your questions to demonstrate why 5 classes per semester is the correct answer:\n\nMaddy needs 120 total credits to graduate and is attending for 8 semesters. Each class provides 3 credits. Let's verify the calculations:\n\n120 credits \u00f7 3 credits per class = 40 total classes needed\n40 classes \u00f7 8 semesters = 5 classes per semester\n\nThis aligns perfectly with standard college course loads. Most universities recommend 15 credits (5 classes) per semester as the ideal full-time load. Taking more than 5 classes can be overwhelming and may impact academic performance. Many universities actually cap regular semester registration at 18 credits (6 classes) without special permission.\n\nThe 5-class schedule allows students to balance their academic workload with other activities while maintaining steady progress toward graduation. This is why answer A (5 classes per semester) is the logical and practical solution.",
