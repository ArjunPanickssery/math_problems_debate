          "content": "According to the question, Eddy's spider plant produces 2 baby plants 2 times per year. This means in one year, the plant produces a total of 4 baby plants (2 babies \u00d7 2 times). This initial production of 4 babies per year is crucial because these baby plants will also mature and start producing their own babies, leading to exponential growth. That's why we see the progression of 2+2=4 in the first year, then 4 more in the second year, 8 more in the third year, and 16 in the fourth year, ultimately reaching 30 total baby plants over the 4-year period.",
