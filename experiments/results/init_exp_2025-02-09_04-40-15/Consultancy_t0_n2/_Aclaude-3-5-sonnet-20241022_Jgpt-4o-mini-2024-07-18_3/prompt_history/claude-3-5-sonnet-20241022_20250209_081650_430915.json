          "content": "According to the problem, Wyatt has 4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue envelopes. When we say \"fewer than,\" it means we need to subtract. Since Wyatt has 10 blue envelopes, and the yellow envelopes are 4 fewer, we calculate 10 - 4 = 6 yellow envelopes. This is the correct interpretation because \"fewer than\" always indicates subtraction from the reference number. Let me demonstrate with a simple tool:\n\nLet me calculate: 10 blue envelopes - 4 fewer = 6 yellow envelopes\n\nThis shows that Wyatt has 6 yellow envelopes.",
