For the next rows, he has 2 less than the blocks he has from its bottom row. How many blocks did he use in all?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 25.0\nOn the second row, he used 9 - 2 = 7 blocks.\nOn the third row, he used 7 - 2 = 5 blocks.\nOn the fourth row, he used 5 - 2 = 3 blocks.\nOn the fifth row, he used 3 - 2 = 1 block.\nTherefore, he used a total of 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 25 blocks.\n#### 25\n(A): 37.0\nThe first row has 9 blocks.\nEach subsequent row should have 2 less than the first row, so they each have 7 blocks.\nTherefore, we have one row of 9 blocks and four rows of 7 blocks.\nThe total number of blocks is 9 + (4 \u00d7 7) = 9 + 28 = 37 blocks.\n#### 37\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many blocks are in each row of the pyramid? Specifically, can you confirm the pattern of decreasing blocks in each row? \n\nIs the first row indeed 9 blocks, and does each subsequent row decrease by 2 blocks? \n\nHow many rows are there in total, and what is the exact calculation for the total number of blocks used? \n\nCould you clarify if the second row has 7 blocks, the third row has 5 blocks, the fourth row has 3 blocks, and the fifth row has 1 block? \n\nIs there any possibility of misunderstanding the arrangement of blocks in the pyramid?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 25.0\nOn the second row, he used 9 - 2 = 7 blocks.\nOn the third row, he used 7 - 2 = 5 blocks.\nOn the fourth row, he used 5 - 2 = 3 blocks.\nOn the fifth row, he used 3 - 2 = 1 block.\nTherefore, he used a total of 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 25 blocks.\n#### 25"

          "content": "Let me clarify the pattern of blocks in the pyramid:\n\nThe question clearly states that each row has 2 fewer blocks than the row below it. Starting with 9 blocks in the first (bottom) row:\n- Row 1 (bottom): 9 blocks\n- Row 2: 7 blocks (9 - 2)\n- Row 3: 5 blocks (7 - 2)\n- Row 4: 3 blocks (5 - 2)\n- Row 5 (top): 1 block (3 - 2)\n\nThis creates a perfect pyramid shape where each row gets smaller by 2 blocks, making it stable and symmetrical. The total is simply the sum of blocks in each row: 9 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 25 blocks. Answer (A) incorrectly assumes all rows after the first have 7 blocks, which wouldn't form a proper pyramid structure.",
