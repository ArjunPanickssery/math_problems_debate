          "content": "Let me address your questions to show why 12 packs is the correct answer:\n\nThe question states \"John buys 2 packs of index cards for all his students.\" This means he bought 2 packs per class, not per student. The number of students per class isn't relevant to the calculation because John is buying packs per class, not per student. The number of index cards per pack isn't specified because it's not needed for the calculation.\n\nWhile John has 180 total students (6 classes \u00d7 30 students), this information is a distractor. The key phrase \"2 packs for all his students\" means 2 packs per class. Therefore, we simply multiply 6 classes \u00d7 2 packs = 12 total packs.",
