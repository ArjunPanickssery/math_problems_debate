How many more scoops of ice cream does Victoria have than Oli?\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS:\n(B): 4.0\nVictoria has 4 x 2 = 8 scoops of ice cream.\nTherefore, Victoria has 8 - 4 = 4 more scoops of ice cream than Oli.\n#### 4\n(A): 8.0\nVictoria's scoops can be calculated as 4 + (2 \u00d7 4) = 4 + 8 = 12 scoops of ice cream.\nTherefore, Victoria has 12 - 4 = 8 more scoops than Oli.\n#### 8\n### Enquiry from judge:\nHow many scoops of ice cream does Victoria have in total? Is it simply double the amount of Oli's scoops, or is there an additional calculation involved?\n\n\nANSWER YOU ARE ARGUING FOR: (B): 4.0\nVictoria has 4 x 2 = 8 scoops of ice cream.\nTherefore, Victoria has 8 - 4 = 4 more scoops of ice cream than Oli.\n#### 4"

The question asks for how many MORE scoops Victoria has compared to Oli, not her total scoops. To find this difference, we subtract Oli's scoops from Victoria's scoops: 8 - 4 = 4 more scoops. The other answer incorrectly adds Oli's scoops to double his scoops (4 + 8), which doesn't align with the phrase \"twice more scoops\" in the question. When we say \"twice more,\" we simply multiply by 2, not add additional amounts.",
