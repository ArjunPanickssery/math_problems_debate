The problem states that he has \"4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue envelopes.\" When we say \"fewer than,\" it means we need to find the difference between the two numbers. Since Wyatt has 10 blue envelopes, and yellow envelopes are 4 fewer, we need to add 4 to the yellow envelopes to make them equal to blue. Therefore, 14 yellow envelopes - 4 = 10 blue envelopes, confirming that Wyatt has 14 yellow envelopes.",
