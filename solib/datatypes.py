    ## `Question.is_censored`
    To store a question and its answer choices, with no info about ground truth.

    ## `Question.is_grounded`

    for the true answer, -1.0 for the false answer)
    Additional attributes in this case:

        best_answer: the answer_case with the highest value, generally same as true_answer
        worst_answer: the answer_case with the lowest value, generally same as false_answer

    ## `Question.is_elicited`
    To store a question and its answer choices, each with some elicited probability from
    the judge.
    Additional attributes in this case:
        total_prob (float): total probability of all answer cases.
        is_normalized (bool): checks if total_prob = 1.0.
        judge_score (Score): computed. Also requires .is_grounded. Scores the elicited
            probabilities against the true answer.
    Additional methods in this case:
        normalize_probs() -> Question: normalizes the probabilities so that they sum to 1.0.
            Not in-place.

    ## `Question.is_argued`
    To stores answers that are .is_argued, i.e. for each answer, store elicited probs after arguing
    for that answer.
    Additional attributes in this case:
        agent_score_diff (Score): computed. Also requires .is_grounded. Measures how much more the
            agent can convince the judge by arguing for the true answer compared to the false answer.
        judge_score_b0 (Score): computed. Also requires .is_grounded. Expected judge score with beta = 0.0.
        judge_score_b1 (Score): computed. Also requires .is_grounded. Expected judge score with beta = 1.0.
        judge_score_binf (Score): computed. Also requires .is_grounded. Expected judge score with beta = inf.

        agent_score_b1 (Score): computed. Expected agent score with beta = 1.0.

    Additional methods in this case:
        open_probs(beta: float) -> dict[str, Prob]: Also requires .is_argued. Returns a dict mapping each answer
            case to its propensity of being argued for, given beta.
        judge_score_expected(beta: float) -> Score: Also requires .is_grounded. Scores the elicited
            probabilities against the true answer, given how likely the agent is to argue for each answer.
        agent_score_expected(beta: float) -> Score: Scores the agent's persuasiveness, given how likely the

    To store a transcript en route to eliciting a probability.
    Additional attributes in this case:

    Attributes in all circumstances:
        question (str): must be provided.

            Question.
