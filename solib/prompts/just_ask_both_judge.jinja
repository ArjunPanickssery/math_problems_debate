Question: {{ question }}

I want you to give me your most informed judgment on the probability of each possible answer. Your response must be a JSON object in exactly this format:

{
    "probabilities": {
        "A": 0.7,  // example probability for answer A
        "B": 0.3   // example probability for answer B
    }
}

Requirements:
- Each probability must be a number between 0 and 1
- The probabilities must sum to 1
- Use the exact answer codes from the question (A, B, etc.)
- Do not include any explanations or additional text, just the JSON object
