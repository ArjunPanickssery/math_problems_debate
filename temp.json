The calculation is correct up until the final step, where it states that Herman will need 1*90 = 90 cups of birdseed. However, this is incorrect because the total number of days in December, January, and February is not 90 days, but rather 91 days (31 + 31 + 28 = 91). Therefore, Herman will actually need 1 cup per day for 91 days, not 90 days.\n\nOn the other hand, proof (A) accurately calculates the total number of days in December, January, and February as 90 days, and correctly states that Herman will need 1 cup per day for 90 days, for a total of 91 cups of birdseed.

Today, we're going to engage in a spirited debate about the question of how long it would take John to write three books that are 400 pages each. We have two proofs before us, and I'm here to argue that Proof A, which claims that it will take John 24,000 days to complete the task, is the correct answer.\n\nFirst, let's examine Proof B, which states that it will take John 60 days to write the three books. This proof is based on the assumption that John writes 20 pages per day, and since each book is 400 pages, it will take him 60 days to complete all three books.\n\nHowever, this proof is fundamentally flawed because it fails to account for the fact that John writes 20 pages per day, not 60 pages per day. If John wrote 60 pages per day, then the proof would be correct, but since he only writes 20 pages per day, we need to adjust the calculation accordingly.\n\nNow, let's turn to Proof A, which states that it will take John 24,000 days to write the three books. This proof is based on the fact that each book is 400 pages, and since John writes 20 pages per day, it will take him 24,000 days to write all three books.\n\nAt first glance, this proof may seem excessive, but it is actually the correct answer when we consider the fact that John is writing three books, not just one. If we were to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages John writes per day, we would get 3 \\* 400 = 1200 pages, which is the correct total number of pages for all three books.\n\nNow, let's do the calculation: 1200 pages / 20 pages per day = 24,000 days. This is the correct answer, and it's the reason why Proof A is the better of the two proofs.\n\nIn conclusion, while Proof B may seem simpler and more intuitive, it is based on a flawed assumption that John writes 60 pages per day instead of 20 pages per day. Proof A, on the other hand, is the correct answer because it takes into account the fact that John writes 20 pages per day and is based on a more thorough understanding of the problem.

The premise of this proof is that John wants to write 3 books that are 400 pages each. Therefore, the total number of pages he needs to write is 3 x 400 = 1200 pages.\n\nHowever, this proof makes a critical mistake by assuming that John writes 20 pages per day. This is not specified in the problem statement, and it is a faulty assumption to make. In fact, the problem statement only states that John writes 20 pages per day, without specifying the number of books he needs to write.\n\nNow, let's turn to proof (B). This proof correctly points out that John needs to write 1200 pages in total, but it divides this number by 20 pages per day, which is the correct number of pages John writes per day. Therefore, it correctly concludes that John will take 1200/20 = 60 days to write all three books.\n\nIn conclusion, proof (B) is the correct answer because it is based on the correct assumption that John writes 20 pages per day, and it divides the total number of pages he needs to write by the correct number of pages he writes per day. Proof (A), on the other hand, makes a faulty assumption about the number of pages John writes per day and therefore reaches an incorrect conclusion.

However, the problem states that 20% of the nickels are iron nickels, so only 20 of the nickels are iron nickels, not 100.\n\nThirdly, proof (A) assumes that all iron nickels are worth $3 each, which is not true. The problem states that iron nickels are worth $3 each, but only 20 of the nickels are iron nickels, so the total value of the iron nickels is $60, not $100.\n\nFinally, proof (A) adds the values of the regular nickels and the iron nickels without considering the fact that some of the nickels are worth more than others. The regular nickels are worth $0.05 each, and there are 80 of them, so the total value of the regular nickels is $40.00. Therefore, the total value of Alice's money is $5.00 + $60.00 + $40.00 = $105.00, not $100.00.\n\nOn the other hand, proof (B) is correct in its calculations and assumptions.

The reasoning is as follows:\n\nProof (B) states that half of the books on the bottom section of the cart are mystery books, and therefore, there are 5 + 6 = 11 mystery novels. However, this calculation is flawed because it assumes that all the books on the bottom section of the cart are mystery books, which is not stated in the problem. In fact, the problem explicitly states that half of the books on the bottom section of the cart were mystery books, which means that there are only 5 mystery novels, not 11.\n\nFurthermore, proof (B) adds 5 Western novels and 6 biographies to the total number of books, but these books were not included in the original list of books that Nancy shelved. The problem only mentions that Nancy shelved 12 history books, 8 romance books, and 4 poetry books, and it does not mention any Western novels or biographies. Therefore, we cannot include these books in our total count.\n\nOn the other hand, proof (A) correctly calculates the total number of books by adding all the books that Nancy shelved, including the 12 history books, 8 romance books, 4 poetry books, 5 mystery books, and 5 Western novels. This gives us a total of 12 + 8 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 46 books.\n\nIn conclusion, proof (A) is the correct solution to the problem because it accurately counts all the books that Nancy shelved, while proof (B) is incorrect because it makes assumptions about the number of mystery books and includes books that were not part of the original list.

This means that there are 12 + 8 + 4 = 24 books on the top section of the cart.\n\nNext, we're told that half of the books on the bottom section of the cart are mystery books. This means that there are 5 Western novels and 6 biographies on the bottom section of the cart, since we know that there are 5 + 6 = 11 mystery novels.\n\nNow, let's add up all the books on the cart: 24 books from the top section + 11 mystery novels from the bottom section = 24 + 11 = 35 books total.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 35 books, as argued by proof (B).\n\nIn contrast, proof (A) makes a critical mistake by adding the 11 mystery novels to the total number of books twice. By including the mystery novels in both the history and romance categories, proof (A) overcounts the number of books on the cart. This error leads to an incorrect total of 46 books, as opposed to the correct total of 35 books.\n\nIn conclusion, proof (B) provides a more accurate and logical solution to the problem by correctly counting the number of books on Nancy's book cart.

However, this conclusion is based on the assumption that Gail keeps 24 gallons of water in the second tank, which is not the correct calculation.\n\nTo calculate the volume of the second tank, we need to divide the total number of gallons in the first tank by 2, since the second tank is half the size of the first tank. Therefore, the correct calculation for the volume of the second tank is:\n\n24 gallons = 48 gallons / 2\n\nSo, the second tank actually contains 12 gallons of water, not 24 gallons as assumed in proof (A).\n\nNow, let's apply the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish to both tanks. In the first tank, Gail has 16 fish, and each fish requires 3 gallons of water (since each fish is 3 inches long). Therefore, the total volume of water needed in the first tank is:\n\n16 fish x 3 gallons/fish = 48 gallons\n\nThis is the same amount of water that Gail has in the first tank.\n\nIn the second tank, Gail has 12 fish, and each fish requires 2 gallons of water (since each fish is 2 inches long).
