Many polls indicate that these groups are leaning towards candidates who represent a more inclusive and progressive agenda. This shift in demographic support is critical and suggests that the outcome will likely favor candidates other than Trump.\n\n4. **Third-Party Candidates**: The presence of significant third-party candidates or independent movements can siphon votes away from Trump, especially if they resonate with disenchanted voters from both major parties.
